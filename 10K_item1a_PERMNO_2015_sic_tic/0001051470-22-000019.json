{"cik": "1051470", "company": "CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).\nTenant demand for our communications infrastructure depends on consumers' and organizations' demand for data. Additionally, the willingness of our tenants to utilize our communications infrastructure, or renew or extend existing tenant contracts on our communications infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests;\n\u2022location of our communications infrastructure;\n\u2022financial condition of our tenants, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;\n\u2022willingness of our tenants to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;\n\u2022need for integrated networks and organizations;\n\u2022availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;\n\u2022increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our tenants;\n\u2022mergers or consolidations by and among our tenants;\n\u2022changes in, or success of, our tenants' business models;\n\u2022governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;\n\u2022cost of constructing communications infrastructure;\n\u2022our market competition, including tenants that may elect to self-perform;\n\u2022technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as a substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and\n\u2022our ability to efficiently satisfy our tenants' service requirements.\nA slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or services.\nThe amount, timing, and mix of our tenants' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. Changes in tenant network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure. As a result, changes in tenant plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies (including small cells and fiber solutions), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Furthermore, the industries in which our tenants operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand for data or general economic conditions. There can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our tenants or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services. In addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental tenants or services. Such an industry slowdown or a reduction in tenant network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.\nOur three largest tenants are T-Mobile , AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The loss of any one of our largest tenants as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our tenants or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, communications infrastructure assets, or intangible assets (including goodwill), or (4) other adverse effects to our business. We cannot guarantee that tenant contracts with our largest tenants will not be terminated or that these tenants will renew their tenant contracts with us. In addition to our three largest tenants, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from (1) fiber solutions tenants and (2) new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services. Such tenants (including those dependent on government funding) may be smaller or have less financial resources than our three largest tenants, may have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital.\nConsolidation among our tenants will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example, where they are co-residents on a tower or small cell network, which may result in the termination, non-renewal or re-negotiation of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant contracts, we generally expect that the impact to our site rental revenues from any termination of our tenant contracts as a result of such potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. Such consolidation (or potential consolidation) may result in a reduction or slowdown in such tenants' network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. Tenant consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure and services, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows and may trigger a review for impairment of certain long-lived assets.\nOn January 6, 2022, we entered into the T-Mobile Agreement. We anticipate that the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation contemplated in the T-Mobile Agreement will result in higher Towers non-renewals in 2025, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $200 million. Except for full year 2025, we expect our annual Towers non-renewals to remain in line with our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues. Additionally, we anticipate that the T-Mobile and Sprint network consolidation will result in small cell non-renewals, which are expected to reduce site rental revenues by approximately $45 million, with the majority occurring in 2023. Except for full year 2023, we expect consolidated annual small cell non-renewals to remain in line with the our historical range of 1% to 2% of annual site rental revenues.\nSee \"Item 1. Business-The Company\" and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our largest tenants.\nThe expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.\nWe seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings (such as small cells and fiber solutions), or other strategic growth opportunities. In the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. Such transactions or activities could be a complex, costly, time-consuming process, or cause disruptions in, increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things, such transactions and activities may:\n\u2022disrupt our business relationships with our tenants, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;\n\u2022divert capital and the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;\n\u2022fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated;\n\u2022increase operational risk or volatility in our business;\n\u2022not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected;\n\u2022impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees;\n\u2022increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees; or\n\u2022result in the need for additional TRSs or contributions of certain assets to TRSs, which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.\nOur Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.\nIn recent years, we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our Fiber business, which is a much less mature business for us than our Towers business. Our Fiber segment represented 33% and 34% of our site rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The business model for our Fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our Towers operations, including certain differences relating to tenant base, competition, contract terms (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), upfront capital requirements, landlord demographics, deployment and ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements, government regulations, growth rates and applicable laws.\nWhile our Fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our Towers operations, they also have certain operational risks (including the scalability of processes) that are different from our Towers business, including:\n\u2022the use of public rights-of-way and franchise agreements;\n\u2022the use of poles and conduits owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties;\n\u2022risks relating to overbuilding;\n\u2022risks relating to the specific markets in which we choose or plan to operate;\n\u2022risks relating to construction hazards, including boring, trenching, utility and maintenance of traffic hazards;\n\u2022construction management and construction-related billings to tenants;\n\u2022risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks, or tenants utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets;\n\u2022the risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands;\n\u2022damage to our assets and the need to maintain, repair, upgrade and periodically replace our assets;\n\u2022the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software;\n\u2022network data security risks;\n\u2022the risk of new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber;\n\u2022potential damage to our overall reputation as a communications infrastructure provider; and\n\u2022the use of CLEC status.\nIn addition, the rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. For example, our tenants have initially focused on utilizing towers in the first phase of deploying their 5G networks, which has led to delays in some of our small cell deployments. We anticipate that these delays will be temporary, as our tenants plan for the next phase of their 5G network deployment which we believe will require small cells at scale. Our Fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our Towers business as a result of numerous factors, including those stemming from the deployment, location or nature of the assets involved. There may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware.\nFailure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.\nOur construction projects and related contracts can be long-term, complex in nature, dangerous, costly and challenging to execute. The quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated tenant relationship and (2) the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources. In connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity, and contractor pricing and performance.\nIn addition, the construction projects (including modifications of existing infrastructure) can pose certain safety risks, including:\n\u2022risks resulting from elevated work, including falling hazards;\n\u2022risks of third-party non-compliance with safety regulations, industry best practices or other applicable standards;\n\u2022risks associated with utility hazards, including gas line, electrical or sewage strikes, which may result in explosions, electrocution and other potentially catastrophic events; and\n\u2022risk of potential wildfires, including due to welding, grinding, cutting or other construction activity.\nSuch safety risks may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, suspension of operations or services, or significant damage to the environment, creating financial, regulatory or reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. See \"Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters,\nincluding wildfires, and other unforeseen events\" below for additional information regarding potential adverse impacts to our business which may result from wildfires and other climate-related events.\nFurther, investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on our existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels. Additionally, contracts with our tenants for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. On occasion, we experience unforeseen delays from municipalities and utility companies that result in longer construction timelines than expected, which impact our ability to timely deliver on our projects. We may also experience unforeseen delays as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Our failure to manage such tenant relationships, project resources, and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner and appropriately manage safety risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNew technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.\nImprovements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of communication networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure. For example, new technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing, joint development, backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants, such as signal combining technologies or network virtualization, may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure. In addition, other technologies, such as WiFi, Distributed Antenna Systems (\"DAS\"), other small cells, blimps, satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed. In addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. Any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe property interests and other rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land under our towers, are derived from leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, and franchise and other agreements. A loss of these interests and other rights may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases or other agreements on commercially viable terms.\nOur ability to retain rights to the land on which our towers are located depends on our ability to purchase such land, by acquiring fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the agreements relating to such land. Approximately 10% of our Towers site rental gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was derived from towers where the leases for the land under such towers had final expiration dates of less than 10 years. If we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including agreements assumed by T-Mobile in connection with its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. We have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. Even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the T-Mobile or AT&T towers for business or other reasons. In the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. Additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n\u202222% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with AT&T for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on Towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.\n\u202216% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master leases, subleases or other agreements with T-Mobile (which T-Mobile assumed in connection\nwith its merger with Sprint). We have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile for approximately $2.3 billion.15% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with T-Mobile for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on Towers site rental gross margin. We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from T-Mobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. In addition, through the T-Mobile Acquisition, another 1% of our towers are subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with AT&T. We have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if such option is exercised, would be due prior to 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).\nUnder master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with AT&T and T-Mobile, including agreements assumed by T-Mobile in connection with its merger with Sprint, certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. If one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. If our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.\nFor our small cells and fiber, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use, fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets. Access to rights-of-way may depend on our CLEC status, and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will (1) recognize such CLEC status or (2) not change their laws concerning CLEC access to rights-of-way. If a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our assets, which may adversely impact our business. In order to operate our assets, we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.\nAdditionally, in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations, we often need to obtain new or additional rights-of-way and other agreements. Our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our tenants and could adversely impact our business.\nOur services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.\nThe operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its non-recurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. Our services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022the timing, mix and amount of tenant network investments;\n\u2022the rate and volume of tenant deployment plans;\n\u2022unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;\n\u2022economic weakness or uncertainty;\n\u2022labor availability and productivity;\n\u2022our market share; and\n\u2022changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.\nIf radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.\nThe potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.\nPublic perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies (such as 5G) may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new wireless technologies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services and technologies. If a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.\nCybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.\nDespite existing security measures, certain of our communications infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software, cyber-attacks and other security breaches. An attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our tenants, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service to our tenants, (3) data transmitted over our tenants' networks being compromised or misappropriated, or (4) business or other sensitive data being compromised or misappropriated. Although we believe we have a comprehensive incident response plan and other cybersecurity measures and policies in place, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in tenant network failures or interruptions that could impact our tenants' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. Additionally, security incidents impacting our tenants, vendors and business partners could result in a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. If an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose tenants. Further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. These attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. In addition, our acquisitions, both past and future, may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above. While we maintain insurance that includes coverage in the event of cybersecurity or other information technology breaches, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such incidents.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.\nWe could be negatively impacted by other unforeseen events, such as extreme weather events or natural disasters (including as a result of any potential effects of climate change), or acts of vandalism. There is increasing concern that global climate change is occurring and could result in increased frequency of certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Although we have implemented a wildfire risk mitigation program, the effects of climate change have increased the risk and extent of wildfires that could potentially result from certain of our construction and maintenance projects and other operating activities. We cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our business. Any such unforeseen events could, among other things, damage or delay deployment of our communications infrastructure, interrupt or delay service to our tenants or could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we currently maintain insurance policies that include coverage in the event of natural disasters and other unforeseen events, including possible incidents in which our actions (or the actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to such events, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure from such events. Further, we do not maintain, and do not expect to maintain, insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions (or those actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to a wildfire event, as a result of the fact that such insurance policies are generally not economically available.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected the U.S. In response, both the public and private sectors have introduced certain policies and initiatives in an effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 (\"Initiatives\"), including the imposition of travel restrictions, quarantine or \"shelter-in-place\" requirements, the promotion of social distancing, vaccination requirements and the adoption of work-from-home and online learning by companies and institutions. In addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the resulting Initiatives have led to, and may continue to lead to, business and global supply chain disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic and social ramifications of the disease, and the societal and governmental responses in the communities in which we operate.\nWe do not believe that COVID-19 had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future is difficult to predict with certainty and depends on numerous evolving factors, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic; the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in curbing the spread of the virus; the vaccination rates and the impact of the vaccine and testing mandates; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic, including with respect to mandatory vaccinations; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. Among other things, COVID-19 and the Initiatives could (1) adversely affect the availability of our suppliers and vendors or their ability to provide products and services to us; (2) result in decreased demand for our communications infrastructure; (3) make it more difficult for us to serve our tenants, including as a result of delays or suspensions in the issuance of permits or other authorizations needed to conduct our business; (4) increase our cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital; and (5) result in difficulty fulfilling our labor needs. Due to factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of COVID-19, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, at this time we cannot estimate or predict with certainty the impact of COVID-19, the Initiatives or the measures we or others take in response thereto on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, particularly over the near- to medium-term, but the impact could be material. See \"Item 7. MD&A-General Overview-COVID-19\" for further information.\nAs a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.\nOur growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts (including amendments to tenant contracts upon modification of an existing tower, fiber, or small cell installation), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate. Competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new tenants, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. In addition, competition (primarily in our fiber solutions business) may, in certain circumstances, cause us to renegotiate certain existing tenant contracts to avoid early contract terminations. We face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast or transmission towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.\nOur Fiber business generally has different competitors than those in our Towers business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions, some of which may have larger networks, greater financial resources or more experience in managing such assets than we have.\nNew wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.\nThere can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies, which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. In addition, demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Debt and Equity\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $20.7 billion as of February 18, 2022). See \"Item 7. MD&A-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. As a result of our substantial indebtedness:\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other general corporate requirements or to refinance our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 7. MD&A-Liquidity and Capital Resources\";\n\u2022we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;\n\u2022we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;\n\u2022we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates;\n\u2022we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;\n\u2022we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u2022we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT due to limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments.\nCurrently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. In addition, the credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") governing our senior unsecured credit facility, which consists of our senior unsecured term loan A facility and senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively, \"2016 Credit Facility\"), contains financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. Furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. If these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. If our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues. See \"Item 7. MD&A-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt Covenants\" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.\nCCIC is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, CCIC's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. Earnings and cash flows generated by CCIC's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to CCIC, in the absence of any special conditions, such as a continuing event of default. However, CCIC's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. See \"Item 7. MD&A-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all.\nEconomic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact (1) the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above, (2) our ability to draw the full amount of our $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Facility (\"2016 Revolver\"), that, as of February 18, 2022, has $5.0 billion of undrawn availability, or (3) our ability to issue the full amount of the $1.0 billion commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\") under our unsecured commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), that, as of February 18, 2022, had $866 million outstanding.\nBorrowings under our 2016 Credit Facility generally bear an interest rate based on LIBOR per annum plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit rating. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that, after 2021, it will stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In March 2021, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to cease the publication of (1) all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021, and (2) the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023. Further, the use of U.S. dollar LIBOR will not be allowed in most new contracts entered into after December 31, 2021. Our Credit Agreement includes \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\"). Although the ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the recommended alternative rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR and has formally recommended the CME Group's forward-looking SOFR term rates, there is not yet a generally accepted methodology for adjusting SOFR. While interest rates on our 2016 Credit Facility were not impacted by the LIBOR settings that ceased publication on December 31, 2021, we are evaluating the potential impact of the LIBOR replacement, including in the event of any amendment to our 2016\nCredit Facility, and we cannot predict with certainty what such replacement rate would be, what other reforms could be implemented in the future, or the potential effect of these changes and the establishment of alternative reference rates on our business. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR could result in interest rate increases on our 2016 Credit Facility, which could adversely affect our cash flows and operating results.\nIf we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. In such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. Failure to repay or refinance indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.\nSales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. Our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. We maintain an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program (\"2021 ATM Program\") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million to or through sales agents. As of February 18, 2022, we had approximately $750 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our 2021 ATM Program. From time to time, we may refresh or implement a new \"at-the-market\" stock offering program. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of February 18, 2022, we had approximately 432 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nWe have reserved approximately 7 million of common stock for issuance in connection with awards granted under our stock compensation plan.\nFurther, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation (\"Charter\"), amended and restated by-laws (\"By-laws\") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti-takeover provisions include:\n\u2022the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock;\n\u2022advance notice and other procedural requirements relating to director nominations or proposals submitted by stockholders for actions to be taken at annual meetings; and\n\u2022provisions that the state courts or, in certain circumstances, the federal courts, in Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us, our directors, officers, employees and stockholders, and, unless the Company otherwise consents, that the federal courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Since the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought pursuant to the Securities Act, there may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws, and this provision does not apply to claims for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction (such as under the Exchange Act).\nOur By-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nRisks Relating to Corporate Compliance\nIf we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.\nA variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in \"Item 1. Business.\" Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our REIT status), increase delays or result in additional costs. We also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, such as those governing environmental and safety matters. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Relating to Our REIT Status\nFuture dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of 2021, we paid a common stock dividend of $1.33 per share, totaling approximately $1.7 billion. In October 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.47 per share, which represents an increase of 11% from the quarterly common stock dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2021. We currently expect our common stock dividends over the next 12 months to be a cumulative amount of at least $5.88 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $2.5 billion. Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. Any future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs) to our stockholders. Our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our NOLs and may cause certain of the NOLs to expire without utilization. See also \"Item 1. Business-REIT Status\" and \"Item 7. MD&A-General Overview-Common Stock Dividend.\"\nAs discussed in \"Item 1. MD&A-Business-Strategy,\" we seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash generated by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. Our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): construction of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of communications infrastructure; acquisitions of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers); improvements and structural enhancements to our existing communications infrastructure; purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; and purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. External financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. As a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nRemaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.\nAs a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common stockholders.\nWhile we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the importance of ongoing factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting REITs, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year.\nIn addition, the present U.S. federal tax treatment of REITs is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and any such change might adversely affect our REIT status or benefits. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes, if enacted, might have on our business. However, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our REIT status.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, then:\n\u2022we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n\u2022we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and, for years beginning before January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax; and\n\u2022we would be disqualified from re-electing REIT status for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified.\nAlthough we may have federal NOLs available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal NOLs have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.\nUnder the Code, for taxable years beginning in or after 2018, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.\nTo remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are required to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement as described above. We commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. See notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination of and declaration by our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash generated by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal NOLs of approximately $1.5 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nTo the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.\nFrom time to time, we may generate REIT taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the REIT dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.\nIn addition to satisfying the 90% distribution requirement, to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. Compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent, limit our\nopportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. In addition, our status as a REIT may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.\nMoreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nREIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.\nIn order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer \"individuals\" (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year. In order to facilitate compliance with the REIT rules, our Charter includes provisions regarding REIT-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any \"person\" (as defined in our Charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than (1) 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or (2) 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock. In addition, our Charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. These ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nCertifications\nWe submitted the Chief Executive Officer certification required by Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") Listed Company Manual, relating to compliance with the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards, to the NYSE on May 26, 2021 with no qualifications. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this 2021 Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 86339, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CCI"}
