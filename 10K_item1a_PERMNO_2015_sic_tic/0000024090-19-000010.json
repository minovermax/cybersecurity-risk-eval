{"cik": "24090", "company": "CITIZENS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our Company involves certain risks. Set forth below are certain risks with respect to our Company. Readers should carefully review these risks, together with the other information contained in this report. The risks and uncertainties we have described in this report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business. Any of the risks discussed in this report or that are presently unknown or not material, if they were to actually occur, could result in a significant adverse impact on our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. References in the risk factors below to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"Citizens\" and like terms relate to Citizens, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statement basis, unless specifically identified otherwise. We operate our subsidiaries as separate and distinct entities with respect to corporate formalities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nA substantial majority of our sales derives from residents of foreign countries and is subject to risks associated with political instability, poor infrastructure and the application of currency control laws and foreign insurance laws. A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial majority of our direct premiums, approximately 72% in 2018, are from foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. These sales are made through independent consultants who are located in these foreign countries. Many of these countries have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, currency fluctuations and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies. The ability of people living in these countries to purchase and continue to make premium payments on our insurance policies and our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise may be adversely affected by political instability. Given the nature of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income and reduced consumer spending, new product sales may be adversely affected. During such periods, we may also experience higher claims incidence, longer claims duration, increase in policy lapses and/or increase in surrenders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We may also be affected by poor utility infrastructure in some of these countries which can impair the ability of our current or prospective policyholders to make payments of any kind. Continued wide spread power outages or any other issues with infrastructure could affect our ability to receive insurance policy applications and premiums from Venezuela, and issue insurance policies to, policyholders in Venezuela. In addition, the imposition of U.S. sanctions against foreign countries where our policyholders reside could make it difficult for us to continue to issue new policies and receive premiums from policyholders in those countries.\nOur Company\u2019s future sales and financial results also depend upon avoiding significant regulatory restraints on receiving insurance policy applications and premiums from, and issuing insurance policies to, policyholders outside of the United States. Currency control laws, other currency exchange restrictions or tax laws in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions or additional fees, costs or taxes on asset transfers outside of a country where our policyowners reside. Difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies to U.S. dollars in certain countries or any increase in fees, costs or taxes associated therewith could prevent our policyowners in those countries from purchasing or paying premiums on our policies and/or make our products less attractive to such policyowners. As such, existing or future laws and regulations, and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also face risks associated with the application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies to residents in foreign countries. Generally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country. Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country. We have never sought to qualify to do business in any foreign country or jurisdiction, except Bermuda, in which CICA Ltd. is domiciled, and have never submitted the insurance policies that we issue to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency. Traditionally, we have sought to mitigate risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets by, among other things, not locating any of our offices or assets in foreign countries, selling policies only through independent consultants rather than our own employees, requiring that all applications for insurance be submitted to and accepted only in our offices in the U.S. or, following the novation of our international policies to CICA Ltd. in Bermuda effective July 1, 2018, in our offices in Bermuda, and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us only in U.S. Dollars. We rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries. There is no assurance that the precautionary measures, practices and policies mentioned above will partially or entirely mitigate the risk associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets. The Company may determine that the risks associated with a particular market and its regulatory environment outweigh the benefits of conducting further business in that market.\nWe have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries. The application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries varies by country. There is a lack of uniform regulation and lack of clarity in certain regulations. Our compliance review has confirmed the previously disclosed risks related to foreign insurance laws associated with our current business model, at least in certain foreign countries. As a result of this evaluation, the Company announced on April 25, 2018 its decision to discontinue accepting life insurance applications from Brazilian residents or citizens. While the Company intends to continue fulfilling commitments under existing policies, it is unclear whether Brazilian regulations or regulators will allow us to continue to do so.\nThere are risks that a foreign government could determine under its existing laws that its residents may not purchase life insurance from us unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by its residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators. There also is a risk that a foreign government will enact additional legislation that may render our existing insurance products either illegal or less attractive to potential customers. There is the further risk that regulators may become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws and seek to impose monetary fines, criminal penalties, and/or order us to cease our sales in that jurisdiction. There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to deem our sales of policies in that country to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country\u2019s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is advisable to, comply with those requirements. Any determination by a foreign country that we or our policy sales are subject to regulation under their laws, or any actions by a foreign country to enforce such laws more aggressively, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell policies in that country and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition. We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions.\nEffective July 1, 2018, the Company novated all of the international policies issued by CICA to CICA Ltd. The novation may result in adverse consequences that are difficult to anticipate. We could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements in Bermuda, and any such requirements could impact the operations of CICA Ltd., result in increased costs for us and impact our financial condition. In addition, how existing policyholders will react to their insurance policies being held by a Bermuda domiciled company, rather than a U.S. domiciled company, is uncertain. If policyholders were to view policies of a Bermuda company as less attractive for any reason, this may result in reduced sales of new policies, fewer renewals and/or a higher level of surrenders of existing policies which may, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nAny disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies to residents of foreign countries, resulting from the actions of foreign regulatory authorities, the withdrawal from Brazil or other markets, the implementation of new Bermuda regulatory obligations or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nOur operating results and financial condition may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with missed tax reporting or noncompliance of some of our products with the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have previously reported that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") of 1986. Further, we have determined that the structure of our policies sold to non-U.S. citizens, which were novated to our Bermuda affiliate effective July 1, 2018, may have inadvertently generated U.S. source income for policyholders over time. Based upon a review of the options available to address these issues, we intend to remediate domestic life and annuity policies sold to U.S. citizens to comply with the IRC. For instance, we expect to settle with the IRS any past liabilities related to the novated policies sold to non-U.S. citizens. The Company has continued to refine its calculation of the exposure and expenses related to these tax issues, as described below for the current reporting period.\nWe have established a best estimate liability of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2018 for probable liabilities and expenses. The range of financial estimates relative to this issue is $6.0 million to $52.5 million. This estimated range includes projected settlement amounts payable to the IRS, as well as any other costs attributed to remediation of non-compliant domestic life insurance. The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS, the number of domestic life and annuity insurance policies we will be required to remediate, the methodology applicable to the calculation of tax liabilities for policies and the amount of time and resources we will require from external advisors who are assisting us with resolving these issues. Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses. To the extent the amount reserved is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOn May 17, 2017, we submitted an offer to enter into Closing Agreements with the IRS covering the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance business. The toll charges calculated and enumerated in the Closing Agreements totaled $124,000 and $4,000 for the CICA and CNLIC domestic life insurance businesses, respectively. We have not yet received any correspondence from the IRS related to our submissions.\nWe have initiated discussions with the IRS to address potential liabilities regarding the CICA international business and our annuity business.\nCICA Ltd. is subject to extensive government regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (\"BMA\"), which is a new regulatory regime for the Company. Failure to comply with regulation by the BMA may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business and negatively impact our financial position or results of operations.\nFor over 40 years, the Company\u2019s life insurance subsidiaries have been regulated in the U.S. by the state insurance departments of their states of domicile. CICA Ltd. was registered in Bermuda under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d) as a Class E insurer in February 2018 and is now subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We have no prior experience operating in a foreign jurisdiction and have limited experience with regulation by the BMA. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in Bermuda could subject us to monetary penalties imposed by the BMA, increased regulatory supervision, unanticipated costs associated with remedying such failure or other claims, harm to our reputation and interruption of our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSustained periods of low interest rates in the long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclines in interest rates and/or the continuance of the current level of low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products. An interest, or discount, rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products. We set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. If the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In that case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient, resulting in the need to increase\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nour reserves and/or increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face financial, liquidity and capital market risks in our operations.\nAs an insurance holding company with significant investment exposure, we face material financial and capital markets risk in our operations. Due to the sustained low interest rate environment in recent years, we experienced significant call activity on our fixed income portfolio that decreased our investment yields compared to prior years. A large portion of our debt security investment portfolio will mature in the next seven years and could be called sooner as we were subject to significant call activity beginning in 2009 due to the declining interest rate environment and we reinvested into shorter durations that are now approaching maturity. We will need to reinvest these maturing funds in the current interest rate environment. Our profitability could be negatively impacted depending on the market rates at the time of reinvestment. This could result in a decrease in our spread between our policy liability crediting rates and our investment earned rates. This could also negatively impact our liquidity.\nWe face potential liquidity risks if policyholders with mature policies elect to receive lump sum distributions at greater levels than anticipated. Our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures. The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a significant amount of endowment products representing approximately 46.0% of total insurance in force with older contracts sold historically that will begin reaching their maturities over the next several years. It is uncertain how policyholders will react in response to these maturities. If policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities. Meeting these distributions could require the Company to sell securities at inopportune times to pay policyholder withdrawals. Alternatively, if the policyholder were to leave the money on deposit with the Company at interest, our profitability could be negatively impacted if the product guaranteed rate is higher than the current market rate we can earn on our investments.\nChanges in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.\nSome of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our \"spread,\" or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is an integral component of our net income.\nIf interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Our fixed income bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as approximately 56% of the portfolio is callable as of December 31, 2018. Lowering our interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.\nAn increase in interest rates will decrease the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio and may subject us to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk is the risk that in a change from a low interest rate period to a significantly higher and increasing interest rate period, policyholders may surrender their policies or make early withdrawals to increase their returns, requiring us to liquidate investments in an unrealized loss position (i.e. the market value less the carrying value of the investments). This risk is discussed further in the two risk factors below.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2018, fixed maturities represented $1.2 billion or 91.7% of our total investments of $1.3 billion. The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\ninterest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as all of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows. Although at December 31, 2018, approximately 98.1% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 75.5% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could be downgraded (with a concurrent decrease in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations. If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.\nValuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.\nU.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either other comprehensive income or in our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period for which the determination is made. The determination of the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates. Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions. In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.\nGross unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities may be realized or result in future impairments, resulting in a reduction in our net income.\nFixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from our net income. Our total gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio at December 31, 2018 were $11.3 million. The accumulated change in estimated fair value of these securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nOur actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies. Reserves, whether calculated under U.S. GAAP or statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality assumptions that are determined by various regulatory authorities. Many reserve assumptions are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. In addition, when we acquire other domestic life insurance companies, our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to our estimates and assumptions. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase policy benefit reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.\nUnanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders or elections by policyholders to deposit distributions at maturity in guaranteed interest contracts could negatively impact liquidity.\nA primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders. Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals, and we track and manage liabilities and attempt to align our investment portfolio to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands. However, early withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder behavior or financial needs, changes in relationships with our independent consultants, changes in our claims-paying ability, or increases in surrenders among policies that have been inforce for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges. In addition, our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures. The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company. The Company has a significant amount of endowment products, with older contracts sold historically that will begin reaching their maturities over the next several years and policyholder election behavior is not known. If policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nWhile we own a significant amount of liquid assets, a certain portion of investment assets are relatively illiquid. If we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity, we could exhaust all other sources of liquidity and be forced to obtain additional financing or liquidate assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn. If we are forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nCatastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and reinsurance availability.\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to sell new policies.\nOur life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths, especially if concentrated in our top foreign markets. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees, our policyholders, our independent consultants or other companies with which we do business could disrupt our\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nbusiness operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the costs of customer relationships acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $155.7 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC. DAC represents costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. Under U.S. GAAP for our type of insurance products, DAC is amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies.\nIn addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called the cost of customer relationships acquired, or CCRA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. At December 31, 2018, we had $15.2 million of CCRA. We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.\nThe amortization of DAC and CCRA is subject to acceleration and generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins. For example, if our insurance policy lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. We regularly review the quality of our DAC and CCRA to determine if they are recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.\nUnfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or CCRA, or both, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the \"reporting unit\" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment. Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses or declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units. If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $4.6 million on our Home Service segment. Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements related to our Life segment was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nManagement\u2019s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including qualitative and quantitative factors such as discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections and trends.\nOur conversion to a new actuarial valuation system is not yet complete and contains known uncertainties that could result in identification of additional errors in our financial reporting.\nThe Company is in the process of converting its actuarial valuation from a third-party service provider to an actuarial valuation modeling software system purchased from a vendor. In connection with our ongoing actuarial valuation conversion, certain legacy\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nsystem immaterial errors were discovered in 2018, 2017 and 2016. As we complete this validation and conversion, we could identify additional differences that will be evaluated for financial reporting purposes. The conversion to the new system has been completed for some of our individual company valuations but is on-going for others and is expected to be completed in the next one to two years.\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits, which may adversely affect our financial condition and detract from the time our management is able to devote to our business, and we are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory matters.\nFrom time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndisputes over insurance coverage or claims adjudication;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance with state laws, including insurance and securities regulations;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance with U.S. federal securities laws, tax, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws, among others;\n\u2022\ndisputes with our independent marketing firms, independent consultants and employee-agents over compensation, termination of contracts, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations and related claims;\n\u2022\ndisputes regarding our tax liabilities;\n\u2022\ndisputes relating to reinsurance and coinsurance agreements; and\n\u2022\ndisputes relating to businesses acquired and operated by us.\nIn the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such claims vigorously. However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business. Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurers with which we do business could increase their premium rates and may not honor their obligations, leaving us liable for the reinsured coverage.\nWe reinsure certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. The high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even if highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain replacement reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at rates economically attractive to us. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. In addition, our reinsurance facilities may be canceled for new business, pursuant to their terms, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a change of control of our Company (generally defined as the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting equity securities) or the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain the minimum required levels of statutory surplus. Any of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2018, we reinsured $490.3 million of the face amount of our life insurance policies. Amounts reinsured in 2018 represented 10.1% of the face amount of direct life insurance in force in that year. Although the cost of reinsurance is, in some cases, reflected in premium rates, under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges us for reinsurance. If our cost of reinsurance were to increase, we might not be able to recover these increased costs, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See Note 5 - \"Reinsurance\" in the notes to our Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOur international markets face significant competition. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur international marketing plan focuses on making available U.S. dollar-denominated life insurance products to individuals residing in foreign countries. New competition could increase the supply of available insurance, which could adversely affect our ability to price our products at attractive profitable rates and thereby adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Existing barriers to entry in the foreign markets we serve may not be sufficient to impede potential competitors\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nfrom entering such markets. In connection with our business with foreign nationals, we experience competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:\n\u2022\nForeign operated companies with U.S. dollar-denominated policies. We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we operate in our international markets, including from a company recently formed by some of our former employees and independent consultants.\n\u2022\nForeign operated companies with locally operated subsidiaries that offer both local jurisdiction regulated products in local currency and off-shore U.S. dollar-denominated policies. This arrangement creates competition in that the U.S. dollar-denominated policies are offered in conjunction with high-need local insurance policies such as health insurance.\n\u2022\nLocal currency policies. These policies provide the benefit of assets located in the country of foreign residents, but entail risks of uncertainty due to local currency fluctuations, as well as the perceived instability and weakness of local currencies.\n\u2022\nLocally operated companies with local currency policies. We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside. Generally, these companies are subject to risks of currency fluctuations, and they primarily use mortality tables based on experience of the local population as a whole. These mortality tables are typically based on significantly shorter life spans than those we use. As a result, the cost of insurance from these companies tends to be higher than ours. Although these companies typically market their policies to a broader section of the population than do our independent marketing firms and independent consultants, there can be no assurance that these companies will not endeavor to place a greater emphasis on our target market and compete more directly with us.\nIn addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets. If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nSales of our insurance products could decline if we are unable to (i) establish and maintain commercial relationships with independent marketing firms and independent consultants, (ii) attract and retain employee agents or (iii) develop and maintain our distribution sources.\nWe distribute our insurance products through several distribution channels, including independent marketing firms, independent consultants and our employee agents. These relationships are significant for both our revenues and our profits. In our Life Insurance segment, we depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing firms and independent consultants. In our Home Service segment, we depend on employee agents whose role in our distribution process is integral to developing and maintaining relationships with policyholders. Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability. Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents and broader arrays of products and have a greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we do. We compete with other insurers for marketing firms, independent consultants and employee agents primarily on the basis of our compensation, products and support services. Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications in our international business model including, without limitation, our novation to our Bermuda-based entity, CICA Ltd., and our withdrawal from certain markets may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nThere may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if our sales representatives are determined not to be independent contractors.\nOur international sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, a foreign agency, a court or other authority will take the different view that our sales representatives should be treated like employees. Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation.\nIf there is a change in the manner in which our independent contractors are classified or an adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, government and private pension plan contributions and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States, which is subject to change and may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business, increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, including state insurance regulations and U.S. federal securities, tax, financial services, privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws. Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies. To that end, all the states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business; mandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets; and restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us.\nThe capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all state insurance regulatory authorities. Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.\nMost insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us. If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop and integrate new information systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences in a cost effective manner. If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including products acquired through acquisition, inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers. We must also effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to consolidate our existing systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards. Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel. Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nthe skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully implement new or upgraded systems and technology. For example, during the third quarter of 2018, we completed the implementation of a new Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning application, which has replaced several of our back office legacy systems, such as the general ledger, accounts payable, cash management, and fixed asset systems. We also implemented a new actuarial valuation and modeling system, GGY AXIS, related to CICA and CICA Ltd. actuarial valuations. There are inherent risks associated with the modifications and transition to our new general ledger system and actuarial valuation system, including the potential for inaccurately capturing data as well as system disruptions. Either of these problems, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a negative impact on our ability to provide timely and accurate financial reporting and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailures of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file reports with the SEC and subject us to litigation and/or regulatory scrutiny and penalties.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in SEC rules and regulations. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. However, these controls may not achieve, and in some cases have not achieved, their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and oversight, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to human error. Controls that rely on models may be subject to inadequate design or inaccurate assumptions or estimates. Controls also can be circumvented by improper management override of such controls. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. The failure of our controls to be effective could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market for our common stock, and could subject us to litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified a deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting that constitutes a material weakness and for which remediation is still in process as of December 31, 2018. If we fail to design effective controls, fail to remediate control deficiencies or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, such failures could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, limit our ability to obtain financing if needed or increase the cost of any financing we may obtain. In addition, these failures may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to litigation and regulatory scrutiny and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nA cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data, damage our reputation or relationships, and expose us to significant financial and legal liability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe store confidential information about our business and our policyholders, independent marketing firms, independent consultants and employee-agents and others on our information technology systems, including proprietary and personally identifiable information. As part of our normal business operations, we use this information and engage third-party providers, including outsourcing, cloud computing, and other business partners, that store, access, process, and transmit such information on our behalf. We devote significant resources and employ security measures to help protect our information technology systems and confidential information, and we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, or other cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nWe and our third-party providers may experience information security incidents from time to time. There is no assurance that our security systems and measures will be able to prevent, mitigate, or remediate future incidents. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, harm to our brand or reputation, loss of customers and revenues, violations of privacy and other laws, and exposure to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement proceedings, fines, and potentially criminal proceedings and penalties. If we are unaware of the incident for some time after it occurs, our exposure could increase. In addition, the costs to address or remediate systems disruptions or security threats or vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant. As we continue to build our digital capabilities and focus on enhancing the customer experience, the amount of information that we retain and share with third parties is likely to grow, increasing the cost to prevent data security breaches and the cost and potential consequences of such breaches. An information technology systems failure could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.\nThe failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a catastrophe, cyber attack, or other event could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a catastrophe, an epidemic, a cyber attack, cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure, a terrorist attack, or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data or result in a significant failure of our internal control environment. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised.\nThe failure of our information technology and/or disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations and result in the loss, theft, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, and increased expenses, and lead to a loss of customers and revenues.\nWe depend on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts for us to conduct our operations. Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of payments they may make to us and their ability to transfer funds to us may be impaired by adverse financial results or a change in capital requirements. Accordingly, internal sources of capital and liquidity may not always be sufficient. If we need to seek external capital, adverse market conditions may affect our access to capital or our cost of capital.\nAs a holding company, our principal asset is the stock of our subsidiaries. We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital and other corporate expenses. The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions. Generally, the net assets of our insurance company subsidiaries available for dividends are limited to either the lesser or greater (depending on the state of domicile) of the subsidiary's net gain from operations during the preceding year or 10% of the subsidiary's net statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.\nExcept to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors and shareholders. If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and shareholders will have no right to proceed in their own right against the assets of that subsidiary or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws.\nAdditionally, any change in demand for our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact their cash flows from operations. Deterioration in the credit market, which could delay our and our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to sell positions in certain of fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, could also negatively impact our and our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows. Regulatory changes such as those discussed herein\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nin this Item 1A may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries and/or implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms, or at all, which may adversely affect us.\nIf our financial results are unfavorable, we may need to increase our capital in order to satisfy regulatory requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Bermuda. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny or action by regulatory authorities. Need for additional capital may limit a subsidiary's ability to distribute funds to our holding companies.\nObtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty. The markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities take negative actions against us. Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in the Company.\nUnexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nWe evaluate our deferred tax asset (\"DTA\") quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence. This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results. Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.\nWe face a greater risk of money laundering activity associated with sales derived from residents of certain foreign countries.\nSome of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering. As required by Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") regulations applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering program that includes policies and procedures for complying with our applicable BSA program, auditing, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering, fraud and other criminal activity (\"BSA Program\"). We have an enhanced BSA Program with additional controls, such as watch-list screening software beyond sanctions screening required by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls. However, there can be no assurance that these enhanced controls will entirely mitigate money laundering risk associated with these jurisdictions.\nEvents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThere are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, cyber or other information security incidents and disputes with our independent consultants.\nIn addition, as an insurance company, we are paid to accept certain risks. Those who conduct our business, including executive officers and members of management, and to some extent, independent consultants, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective. If our employees and independent consultants take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nDepending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital and/or increase our cost of capital.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Stock\nIf our foreign policyholders reduced or ceased participation in our Citizens's Inc. Stock Investment Plan (the \"CISIP\") or if a securities regulatory authority were to deem the CISIP's operation contrary to securities laws, the volume of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the CISIP, and the price of our Class A common stock, could fall.\nMore than 95% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the CISIP in 2018 were purchased by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers); the remaining 5% of the shares of Class A common stock purchased under the CISIP in 2018 were purchased by approximately 1,723 participants residing in the United States. The CISIP is registered with the SEC pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction. If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the CISIP were contrary to applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against us in that foreign jurisdiction. There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the CISIP. If fewer policyholders elect to participate in the Plan, or our international premium collections were to decrease as a result of regulatory, economic, or marketing impediments, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels, the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted and the price of our Class A common stock could fall.\nDue to required regulatory approval for acquisition of control of a regulated U.S. domestic insurance company, control of our Company, through the ownership of our Class B common stock, has not yet transferred from our founder's trust to a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation established by our founder, and we cannot determine whether or when any change in our management, operations, or operating strategies will occur.\nHarold E. Riley, our founder, was the beneficial owner of 100% of our Class B common stock, which was held in the name of the Harold E. Riley Trust (\"Trust\"), of which he had served as Trustee until his death in September 2017. Our Class A and Class B common stock are identical in all respects, except the Class B common stock elects a simple majority of the Board and receives one-half of any cash dividends paid, on a per share basis, to the Class A common stock. The Class A common stock elects the remainder of the Board. The Trust documents provided that upon Mr. Riley's death, the Class B common stock will transfer from the Trust to the Harold E. Riley Foundation, a charitable organization established under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Foundation\").\nTo date, the estate process related to the Class B common stock is not complete and the required state insurance regulatory approvals for change of control to occur have not been received. Therefore, the Trust, of which Mr. Riley's estate is the trustee, currently remains the holder of record of the Class B common stock. The Foundation and the Estate of Harold E. Riley are proceeding independent of the Company to obtain regulatory approval from the Colorado Division of Insurance, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Louisiana Department of Insurance and the Mississippi Department of Insurance through the requisite Form A approval process. The Company does not know if or when regulatory approvals of the transfer ultimately will be granted. If such approvals are obtained from the states' department of insurances listed above, the Company will record the transfer of the controlling Class B common stock from the Trust to the Foundation in the Company's shareholder records.\nThe Foundation is organized as a public support charity for the benefit of its charitable beneficiaries, Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. The Foundation is governed by a board of trustees appointed by Harold Riley prior to his death, Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. It is unclear what, if any, change may occur to our Board, management, or corporate operating strategies as a result of ownership of our Class B common stock by the Foundation.\nIf and when the Foundation becomes the record holder of the Class B common stock, the first of two prongs of certain \"change in control\" provisions in the employment agreement of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Geoffrey Kolander, dated January 23, 2019 will be triggered. Under Mr. Kolander's new employment agreement effective January 1, 2019, a \"change in control\" includes, among other things (1) the regulatory approval of the transfer of the Class B common stock from the Trust to any individual, entity or group, other than regulatory approval of a transaction wherein the Company is the first to repurchase the Class B common stock directly from the Trust or the Foundation and (2) the exercise of a power of attorney granted by Harold E. Riley over the Company's Class B common stock by the Trust or the Foundation. If his employment is terminated by Mr. Kolander or\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nby the Company without cause, in each case, within eighteen (18) months of a change in control, Mr. Kolander would be entitled to receive certain cash payments and benefits.\nThe price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nOur Class A common stock price has historically fluctuated and is likely to fluctuate in the future and could decline materially because of the volatility of the stock market in general, decreased participation in the CISIP referred to above or a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: quarterly or annual variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations; interest rate fluctuations; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; competition and other factors affecting the life insurance business generally; and conditions in the U.S. and world economies.\nOur international markets, and the specific manner in which we conduct our business in those jurisdictions, may be subject to negative publicity in social media or other channels, which may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe interface with and distribute our products to residents of foreign countries that may be subject to the risks disclosed in our Item 1A. Risk Factor under the heading, \"A substantial majority of our sales derives from residents of foreign countries and is subject to risks associated with widespread political instability, currency control laws and foreign insurance laws. A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition\". Venezuela is one such example. Accordingly, from time to time, bloggers or other social media outlets relevant to investors may focus attention on our exposure to these countries and the negative circumstances surrounding their governments, thereby subjecting us to periodic negative publicity. Negative publicity on investor blogs or through other media channels could impact trading in our stock especially due to aggressive and coordinated efforts between anonymous bloggers and short sellers which may ultimately cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable state insurance laws, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as various state insurance laws, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt our shareholders might consider in their best interests. As a result, our shareholders will be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThe following provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:\n\u2022\nholders of shares of our Class B common stock elect a simple majority of our Board, and all of these shares are held by the Harold E. Riley Trust until such time that the Harold E. Riley Foundation receives regulatory approval for acquisition of the Class B common stock and becomes holder of record; and\n\u2022\nour Board may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.\nState insurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company. Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition. In addition, a person seeking to acquire control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states. These state insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, as it is our policy to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nCITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 23799, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "CIA"}
