{"cik": "1070081", "company": "PTC THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Planned Acquisition of EmflazaTM (deflazacort)\nConsummation of our planned acquisition of EmflazaTM (deflazacort) from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Marathon, is subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including antitrust approval, which, if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may prevent, delay or impair the consummation of the transaction, result in additional expenditures of money and resources, subject us to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and operations, and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nOn March 16, 2017, we announced that we have entered into an asset purchase agreement with Marathon under which we have agreed to acquire all rights to Emflaza. Completion of the planned acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, the clearance of the transaction by certain governmental and regulatory authorities, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The governmental and regulatory agencies with which we and Marathon will make these filings and seek certain of these approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering applicable governing regulations. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals and consents will be obtained. Moreover, as a condition to their approval of the transaction, certain governmental agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after the closing of the transaction. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the transaction or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Further, no assurance can be given that the required closing conditions will be satisfied and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or clearances. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in a failure to close the transaction or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, while the transaction is pending, we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the transaction is consummated and for a period of time thereafter. We may also experience negative reactions from our stockholders, patients, the medical community, vendors, payors, and employees, among others. Further, if the transaction is not completed for any reason, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed and the perception of the effectiveness of our management and our company may suffer in the marketplace. In addition, some costs related to the transaction must be paid whether or not it is completed.\nEven if we successfully consummate our planned acquisition of Emflaza, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, or we may encounter significant integration difficulties.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the planned acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Emflaza into our business and realize anticipated growth opportunities and synergies. We have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products in the United States and we expect the process will be complex, costly and time-consuming. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating this product into our business. The process may be disruptive to our business and the expected benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The failure to meet the challenges involved and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our commercialization efforts and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction is expected to entail numerous material potential difficulties, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nchallenges related to public and market perception of Emflaza and/or our acquisition of the product;\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny from third parties, including regulators, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies, with respect to product pricing and commercialization matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company following the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences, unforeseen increased expenses or other unanticipated problems associated with the transaction.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and further diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, following the completion of the acquisition, we will possess not only the rights to Emflaza, but also certain corresponding liabilities and obligations, including the contractual liabilities and regulatory obligations that will be assumed by us upon closing of the transaction, including certain post-marketing commitments. These obligations are expected to result in additional investment in Emflaza by us, and failure to satisfy any such requirements could delay our realization of, or prevent us from ever realizing, the anticipated benefits from the transaction. Further, it is possible that undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems may arise in the future of which we were previously unaware. These undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact our stock price. As a result, it cannot be assured that the pending transaction with Marathon will result in the full realization of the benefits anticipated from the transaction within the anticipated time frames or at all.\nIn addition, upfront consideration for the planned acquisition is comprised of approximately $75 million in cash and approximately $65 million in our common stock, subject to a maximum 6.9 million share limit (with any shortfall to be made whole with additional cash consideration). Marathon is also entitled to receive payments from PTC based on annual net sales of Emflaza beginning in 2018 and has the opportunity to receive a single $50 million sales-based milestone. The issuance of our common stock to complete this transaction will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and because we have limited financial resources, by investing in this transaction, we may forego or delay pursuit of other opportunities that may have proven to have greater commercial potential.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and expenses for at least the next several years.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $735.1 million. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, the private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings, and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product and product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOn March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF, our Phase 3 clinical for Translarna in nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis, or nmCF, and that, as a result, we plan to discontinue our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF. We have withdrawn our type II variation submission with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which sought approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the European Economic Area, or EEA.\nIn October 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat, or ITT, population did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD, our Phase 3 clinical trial for TranslarnaTM (ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD. Please review the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations\u201d for additional information on recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain or maintain marketing authorizations necessary to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, Europe and other territories.\nOur current ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further subject to a specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 18-month, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18-month open-label extension, according to an agreed protocol, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna in the approved patient population. Enrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we expect that we will incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. In addition, it is likely that we will enroll patients in Study 041 in countries where Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is currently available on a reimbursed basis, which could negatively impact growth in\nour net product sales. We may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nIf, in any annual renewal cycle, the EMA determines that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has changed materially or that we have not or are unable to comply with the specific obligation to complete Study 041 or any other requirement that has been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or impose other specific obligations or restrictions, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business. We expect to incur significant costs in connection with our efforts to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA. If our marketing authorization in the EEA is not renewed, or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or a reimbursed early access program, or EAP program, and throughout all territories. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cOur marketing authorization in the EEA is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 by September 2021, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of our marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nWe also expect that our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, whether pursuant to the recently initiated file over protest process with the FDA, or otherwise, will be time-consuming and may be expensive. For additional information, see the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cThere is substantial risk that the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and we will be unable to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States in a timely manner, or at all, whether pursuant to the file over protest process or otherwise, and by determining to file our NDA over protest, we have postponed other available strategic pathways which may have proven to be more effective. If there are delays in obtaining regulatory approval in the United States, we will not be able to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD in that territory and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. In the event that the FDA requires us to conduct a new clinical trial in nmDMD which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us, we would expect to incur significant costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\u201d\nWe anticipate that our expenses will further increase in connection with the expansion of our global infrastructure as we continue to establish an international presence and commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, distribution and manufacturing and administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition, the clinical and regulatory developments noted in this risk factor may exacerbate the risks related to our commercialization efforts set forth under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates,\u201d which could increase the costs associated with our commercial activities or have a negative impact on our revenues. For additional information, see also, the risk factor under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d titled \u201cOur initial commercial launch of Translarna has begun in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our anticipated revenue, growth and business.\u201d\nWe may seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with our open label extension clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD as well as our Phase 2 studies for nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5. We also expect to incur ongoing research and development expenses for our other product candidates, including our cancer stem cell program. We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses. With respect to our outstanding 3.00%\nconvertible senior notes due August 15, 2022, or the Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.5 million annually.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\u2022\nare required to complete any additional clinical and non-clinical trials or analyses in order to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nare required to take other steps, in addition to Study 041, to maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain further marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or other indications;\n\u2022\ninitiate or continue the research and development of Translarna for additional indications and of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\ncomplete our planned acquisition of Emflaza, subject to satisfying closing conditions and obtaining applicable regulatory approvals, integrate the acquired assets into our business, and seek to satisfy contractual and regulatory obligations that will be assumed by us following closing of the planned acquisition.\nWe also could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of the pending securities class action lawsuits brought against us and certain of our executives, as described under Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and become and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\u2022\nmaintaining the marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, including successfully obtaining annual renewals of the marketing authorization, fulfilling the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 to the EMA, and meeting any ongoing requirements related to the marketing authorization;\n\u2022\nadvancing Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States in a timely manner, or at all, whether pursuant to the file over protest process with the FDA or otherwise, and including, if required, performing additional clinical and non-clinical trials or analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nexpanding the territories in which we are approved to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nminimizing the enrollment impact of Study 041 on commercialization efforts for Translarna for nmDMD;\n\u2022\ndeveloping Translarna for the treatment of additional indications, including nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 and successfully advancing our other programs and collaborations, including our cancer stem cell and SMA programs;\n\u2022\nestablishing a global commercial infrastructure, including the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other parts of the world;\n\u2022\nimplementing marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022\nnegotiating and securing adequate pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on a timely basis, or at all, in the countries in which we have obtained, and may obtain, regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nnegotiating and securing adequate reimbursement from other third-party payors for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in accordance with our estimated timeline\n\u2022\nidentifying patients eligible for treatment with Translarna for nmDMD;\n\u2022\nobtaining approval to market Translarna for the treatment of other indications;\n\u2022\nexpanding the approved product label of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully developing or commercializing any product candidate or product that we may in-license or acquire, including Emflaza;\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to Translarna; and\n\u2022\ncontracting for the manufacture and distribution of commercial quantities of Translarna.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs noted in the prior risk factor, we expect to incur significant expenses related to our clinical, regulatory, commercial, legal, research and development, and other business efforts. We believe that our cash flows from product sales, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our Convertible Note offering, public offerings of common stock, marketable securities and research funding that we expect to receive under our collaborations, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including whether the EMA determines on an annual basis that the benefit-risk balance of Translarna supports renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, on the current approved label, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of Study 041;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, whether pursuant to the file over protest process with the FDA, or otherwise, and including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials or complete additional analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our pediatric study of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our open label extension clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD as well as our studies for nmMPS I and nonsense mutation aniridia and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 and activities under our cancer stem cell program;\n\u2022\nthe scope, costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, legal, regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, for nmDMD and any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization or any additional indications or territories in which we receive authorization to market Translarna;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our other product candidates and Translarna in other territories or for indications other than nmDMD;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of growth in our employee base;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for Translarna for additional indications and for our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nrevenue received from commercial sales of Translarna or any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully negotiate adequate pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis, or at all, in the countries in which we may obtain regulatory approval, including the countries in the EEA;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on adequate terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products, product candidates, and technologies, including the success of any acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transaction we may pursue, including our planned acquisition of Emflaza, and the costs of subsequent development requirements and commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, including our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, and our ability to obtain research funding and achieve milestones under these agreements.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales for certain product candidates or indications. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success, including Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nTo date all of our product revenue has been attributable to sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States. We are continuing to engage in significant commercialization efforts for this product. In order to continue sales and our commercial launch of Translarna, we must maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA and secure market access through commercial programs following the conclusion of pricing and reimbursement terms at sustainable levels in the member states of the EEA or through EAP programs in the EEA and other territories. Other commercial revenue, if any, would be derived from product acquisitions or, if none, from sales of products that we are not planning to have commercially available for several years, if at all. If our marketing authorization in the EEA is not renewed, or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories.\nAccordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing in connection with our continuing operations and to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or based on strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions to acquire assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations. We may not identify suitable strategic transactions, or complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential opportunities that are never completed or we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of such opportunities. Even if we successfully execute a strategic transaction, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith, and may experience losses related to our investments in such transactions. Integration of an acquired company or assets into our existing business may not be successful and may disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Even if we are able to achieve the long-term benefits of a strategic transaction, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity. Any of the foregoing could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, future strategic transactions may entail numerous operational, financial and legal risks, including:\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nexposure to known and unknown liabilities, including possible intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, tax liabilities and commercial disputes;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating operations and personnel of any acquired business;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses or, in the event that we write-down the value of acquired assets, impairment losses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership;\n\u2022\ninability to retain personnel, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners integral to an in-licensed or acquired product, product candidate or technology;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges;\n\u2022\nentry into indications or markets in which we have no or limited direct prior development or commercial experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u2022\nother challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage any strategic transaction in which we may engage, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand and diversify our product pipeline may be limited.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings; debt financings; collaborations; strategic alliances; grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates; and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates; or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for our stockholders to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nSince mid-2014, we have been transitioning from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting global commercial activities. We may not be successful in completing this transition. Our ability to develop product candidates, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, and conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for a successful full scale product commercialization is largely limited to our activities with respect to the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual review and renewal following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA and satisfaction of the specific obligation to conduct and report to the EMA Study 041. In addition, other than our marketing authorization in the EEA and the marketing authorizations granted in Israel and South Korea (which are largely contingent upon continued EMA approval), we have not proven our ability to successfully obtain marketing authorizations to sell our product or product candidates. Further, we recently announced that we are discontinuing our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF based on the results of ACT CF, and we may not successfully complete development of other product candidates. Consequently, any predictions our stockholders make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be subject to annual limitations under federal and state tax law that could materially affect our ability to utilize such losses and attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 382, the corporation\u2019s ability to utilize any net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain tax credits and other attributes generated before such an ownership change, is limited. We believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 that have resulted in limitations under Section 382 (and similar state provisions) on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nFuture changes in ownership could result in additional ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 that could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes.\nChanges in our effective income tax rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the Unites States and various foreign jurisdictions. Taxes will be incurred as income is earned among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in accounting standards, future levels of research and development spending, changes in the mix and level of pre-tax earnings by taxing jurisdiction, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits, the realization of deferred tax assets, or by changes to our ownership or capital structure. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors and others may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, there is growing pressure in many jurisdictions (including the United States) and from multinational organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and the EU, to amend existing international tax rules in order to render them more responsive to current global business practices. For example, the OECD has released guidance relating to various international tax related topics in an initiative referred to as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy. Depending on the final form of the BEPS guidance and the legislation ultimately enacted by the OECD members, BEPS could have material adverse consequences on our effective tax rate, the amount of tax we pay and on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have recently begun publicly considering potential tax reform, including the possibility of replacing large parts of the existing federal income tax with a so-called \u201cdestination-based cash flow tax\u201d in addition to other potential tax reforms that the recently elected President and members of his administration may be considering.\nAlthough we monitor these developments, it is very difficult to assess to what extent these changes may be implemented in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business or may impact the way in which we conduct our business or our effective tax rate due to the unpredictability and interdependency of these potential changes. Changes in tax laws and related regulations and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, effective tax rate and financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates\nACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nIn October 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD. On the basis of our position that the totality of clinical data from ACT DMD and our prior Phase 2b trial support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we submitted our analyses of the ACT DMD data and meta-analysis of the combined ACT DMD and Phase 2b subgroup data to the FDA, as part of our NDA.\nOn February 22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA stating that, in the view of the FDA, both our Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. In October 2016, the FDA denied our first appeal of the Refuse to File letter. In the first quarter of 2017, we filed our Translarna NDA for nmDMD with the FDA via the \u201cfile over protest\u201d process that allows a company to have its NDA filed and reviewed when there is a disagreement with regulators over the acceptability of the NDA submission. When an application is filed over protest, the FDA is required to review the application as filed. Generally, the FDA does not favor the file over protest procedure and the agency\u2019s policies explain that an application filed over protest does not receive a timeline for review and is designated as a standard review. The FDA has granted a standard review for the NDA and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of October 24, 2017. The PDUFA date is the goal date for the FDA to complete its review of the NDA, however, such date is not binding on the agency and there can be no assurance that the FDA will complete its review of our NDA by the PDUFA goal date.\nThere is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any dialogue we have had or any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, pursuant to the file over protest process or otherwise, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials. Even if we are successful in resolving some or all of\nthe matters raised by the FDA in the Refuse to File letter, there is significant risk that we will be unable to obtain FDA approval of Translarna for nmDMD, on a timely basis or at all, and we may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials or complete additional analyses at significant cost. Even if we are able to enroll and fund any such additional trials or complete such analyses, there is substantial risk that the results would not ultimately support the approval of the NDA filed over protest or a new NDA submission in the United States for Translarna for nmDMD. In addition, any such requirement for additional trials would most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the United States for a significant period of time, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Due to these uncertainties, we are unable to estimate the timing or potential for a launch of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States.\nWe also submitted our analyses of the ACT DMD data and meta-analyses of the combined ACT DMD and Phase 2b subgroup data to the EMA to support continuation of our marketing authorization in the EEA, which is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization. The EMA and European Commission did not approve our request for full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and, instead, approved the annual renewal of our conditional marketing authorization with the specific obligation to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged 5 years or older via Study 041.\nEnrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we expect that we will incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. We expect that conducting a placebo-controlled trial in nmDMD of this size will be challenging and it is probable that we will enroll patients in territories where Translarna has already become available on a reimbursed basis, which could negatively impact growth in our product sales. We may enroll patients in countries with a different standard of care for nmDMD patients or at clinical trial sites that are inexperienced with clinical trials in general, or specifically with nmDMD trials. In addition, we may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nThe marketing authorization renewal approved in January 2017 is effective through August 5, 2017, unless extended. If the EMA determines in any annual renewal cycle that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has changed materially or that we have not or are unable to comply with any conditions that have been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require the imposition of other conditions or restrictions. As such, there is ongoing risk to our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nOur current ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. If we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is substantial risk that other regulators where we have not yet sought or are currently seeking marketing authorization will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in those applicable territories. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or obtain marketing authorizations in areas where such authorizations are contingent upon decisions of the EMA with respect to our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nFor additional information, see \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d below.\nWe depend heavily on the success of our lead product, Translarna, which we are developing for nmDMD and other indications. All of our other product candidates, including those under our collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation, are still in early clinical or preclinical development. If we are unable to execute our commercial strategy for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, fail to receive regulatory approval in the United States and other territories, fail to obtain renewal of, or satisfy the conditions of our marketing authorization in the EEA, or if we experience significant delays in accomplishing such goals, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of Translarna.\nOn March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF and that, as a result, we plan to discontinue our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF. We have withdrawn our type II variation submission with the EMA, which sought approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the EEA, and do not currently expect to pursue other marketing authorizations for this indication.\nWhile we have obtained marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, such authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following the annual EMA reassessment as well as the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041. For a review of recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, please review the risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations\u201d\nWe are currently pursuing further clinical development efforts for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, nonsense mutation aniridia, nonsense mutation MPS I, and nonsense mutation CDKL5/Dravet syndrome. Each genetic disorder has unique genetic and pathophysiological characteristics and we believe that regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, will evaluate the effectiveness of Translarna for any given indication based on the merits of the clinical efficacy evidence available for such indication. However, because we are developing Translarna for the treatment of multiple indications associated with genetic disorders that arise as a result of a nonsense mutation, there is a risk that negative results in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of Translarna for one indication, such as ACT CF, could adversely affect the perception of the efficacy of Translarna in a different indication. There can be no assurance that regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, will not consider such results when making determinations with respect to our ongoing or future regulatory submissions for marketing authorization of Translarna for any indication, including in connection with the FDA\u2019s review of our NDA (which was filed over protest with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017) for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and the EMA\u2019s annual reassessment of our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which could have an adverse effect on the outcome of the applicable regulatory review. We intend to submit the safety results of ACT CF to regulators with any applicable safety updates and submissions, including the EMA. While the safety profile of Translarna in the ACT CF study was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified, there can be no assurance that the EMA or other regulators will agree with our interpretation of the safety data from the trial.\nIf we do not successfully renew and maintain our marketing authorization and commercialize Translarna in the EEA, or receive regulatory approval in the United States for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and subsequently successfully commercialize Translarna in the United States, our ability to generate additional revenue will be jeopardized and, consequently, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe success of Translarna will depend on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to continue to satisfy our obligations under, and maintain, the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including whether the EMA determines on an annual basis that the benefit-risk balance of Translarna supports renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, on the current approved label;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of Study 041;\n\u2022\nwhether, and within what timeframe, we are able to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, pursuant to the file over protest process with the FDA or otherwise, and including, whether we will be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials or complete additional analyses at significant cost which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us and, ultimately, may support approval of Translarna for nmDMD in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe successful advancement of Translarna in additional indications, in particular, nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance and expansion of an international commercial infrastructure capable of supporting product sales, marketing, and distribution of Translarna;\n\u2022\nthe implementation and maintenance of marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on adequate terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully prepare and advance regulatory submissions for marketing authorizations for Translarna in additional territories and for additional or expanded indications and whether and in what timeframe we may obtain such authorizations;\n\u2022\nsuccessful negotiation of adequate pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna on a timely basis, or at all, in the countries which require such negotiation and in which we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access Translarna through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of commercial launches of Translarna in nmDMD;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to successfully produce commercial and clinical supplies of Translarna on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our commercial and clinical activities;\n\u2022\nsuccessful identification of eligible patients;\n\u2022\nacceptance of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, including any impact the results of ACT CF may have on the perception of the effectiveness of Translarna;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of Translarna;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; and\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to continue to commercialize Translarna, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe marketing authorization granted by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is limited to ambulatory patients aged five years and older located in the EEA, which significantly limits an already small treatable patient population, which reduces our commercial opportunity and is also subject to annual reassessment of the benefit-risk balance by the EMA as well as the specific obligation to conduct Study 041, and may be varied, suspended or withdrawn by the European Commission if we fail to satisfy those requirements.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD because the number of patients who could benefit from treatment with Translarna is small. The marketing label approved by the European Commission further limits the currently treatable patient population to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged five years and older who have been identified through genetic testing as having a nonsense mutation. Prevalence estimates for rare diseases are uncertain due to the uncertainties associated with the methodologies used to derive estimates, such as epidemiology assumptions. It can take many years of experience in rare disease market places before prevalence becomes well characterized. We are launching the first therapy specifically aimed at nmDMD patients. Our experience to date suggests that there may be up to 7,000 nmDMD patients globally and that approximately 35 to 40% of such patients satisfy the conditions for treatment under our current product label in the EEA, however, we expect that country specific epidemiology will continue to be refined and characterized over the coming years. Our estimates of both the number of people who have DMD caused by a nonsense mutation, as well as the subset of people with nmDMD who are ambulatory and at least five years old (and, therefore, satisfy the conditions for treatment under our current product label in the EEA), are based on our beliefs and estimates derived from a variety of sources and may prove to be incorrect. Prevalence estimates vary given some degree of variation in the incidence of live male births, the incidence of DMD, the incidence of nonsense mutations and other factors. Information concerning the eligible patient population is generally limited to certain geographies and may not employ definitive measures capable of establishing with precision the actual number of nmDMD patients in such geography. If the market opportunities for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD are smaller than we believe they are, our business and anticipated revenues will be negatively impacted. Although we intend to seek to expand the approved product label of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the future, the timing of, and our ability to generate, the necessary data or results required to obtain expanded regulatory approval is currently uncertain. Given the small number of patients who have nmDMD, and the smaller number of patients who meet the criteria for treatment under our current marketing authorization, our commercial opportunity is limited. It is critical to the commercial success of Translarna for nmDMD that we successfully identify and treat these patients.\nTranslarna is not approved, and is an investigational new drug, in the United States. In order to continue to generate revenue from Translarna, we must maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, as well as the specific obligation to complete and report the results of Study 041 to the EMA. The marketing authorization was last renewed in January 2017 and is effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2017. Enrolling Study 041 may further reduce the number of patients available for reimbursed treatment.\nIf the EMA determines in any annual renewal cycle that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has changed materially or that we have not or are unable to comply with any conditions that have been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require the imposition of other conditions or restrictions. As such, there is ongoing risk to our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA. If we are unable to renew our marketing authorization in the EEA during any annual renewal cycle, or if our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program, and in all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d below for further detail regarding conditional marketing authorizations in the EEA.\nIf clinical trials of our product or product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the EMA, the FDA or other regulators, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Translarna or any other product candidate.\nIn connection with seeking marketing authorization from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing authorization of their products.\nOn March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF and that, as a result, we plan to discontinue our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF. We have withdrawn our type II variation submission with the EMA, which sought approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the EEA, and do not currently expect to pursue other marketing authorizations for this indication.\nIn addition, the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in the Phase 2b (completed in 2009) or Phase 3 ACT DMD (completed in 2015) clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. For a review of recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, please review the risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nIf the FDA, the EMA and other regulators do not agree with our interpretation of the results of the clinical data from our trials, including ACT DMD and, when and if completed, Study 041 and related analyses, or otherwise do not view the results of these trials as favorable; if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of Translarna or any other product candidate that we develop beyond those that we contemplate; if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing; if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive; or if there are safety concerns, we may, among other things:\n\u2022\nbe unable to successfully maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual review and renewal following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining additional marketing authorizations, or not obtain additional marketing authorizations at all, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing authorizations, or not obtain marketing authorizations at all, for Translarna for other indications, or for our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or restrictions;\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from markets after obtaining applicable marketing authorizations; or\n\u2022\nnot be permitted to sell Translarna under some or any reimbursed EAP programs.\nIf we or our collaborators experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials related to our product or product candidates, including Study 041 and those under our collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation, maintenance of our existing marketing authorization in the EEA and any additional potential marketing authorization or commercialization of our product or product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing authorization or commercialize our product or product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product or product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product and product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u2022\nwe may enroll patients at clinical trial sites in countries that are inexperienced with clinical trials in general, or with the indication that is the subject of the trial;\n\u2022\nwe may enroll patients at clinical trial sites in countries that have a different standard of care for patients in general, or with respect to the indication that is the subject of the trial;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nregulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or may require us to submit additional data, conduct additional studies or amend our investigational new drug application, or IND, or comparable application prior to commencing a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product or product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product or product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product or product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product or product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; or\n\u2022\nour product or product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials.\nFor example, the Phase 2 Moonfish study, which was evaluating the safety and efficacy of RG7800 under our SMA collaboration, was terminated in December 2016 following a suspension and clinical hold in the first half of 2015 to investigate\nan eye finding in a 39-week study in cynomolgus monkeys. The suspension and termination of Moonfish resulted in unanticipated delays in the advancement of the SMA program.\nIn addition, based on pre-clinical safety signals observed during the third quarter of 2015, we are no longer advancing PTC672 under our antibacterial program. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing authorizations. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product or product candidates, allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, or impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product or product candidates, and so may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD are primarily based on retrospective, subgroup and meta-analyses of the results of our Phase 2b and ACT DMD clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Other than with respect to certain of our meta-analyses, results of our analyses are expressed as nominal p-values, which are generally considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than adjusted p-values. In addition, retrospective analyses are generally considered less reliable than pre-specified analyses.\nAfter determining that we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint with the pre-specified level of statistical significance in our completed ACT DMD and Phase 2b clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we performed subgroup, retrospective, and meta-analyses. On the basis of our position that the totality of clinical data from these trials support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we submitted these analyses to the FDA, as part of our NDA. In addition, after determining that the primary efficacy endpoint did not achieve statistical significance in ACT DMD or our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we performed retrospective and subgroup analyses that we believe provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials.\nAlthough we believe that these additional analyses of the results of these trials were warranted, a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results.\nSome of our favorable statistical data from these trials also are based on nominal p-values that reflect only one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible. A p-value is called nominal if it is the result of one particular comparison prior to any pre-specified multiplicity adjustment, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed. For example, while the p-values for change from baseline at week 48 in the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT, which we also refer to as 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, and each secondary end point timed function test in the pre-specified subgroup of ACT DMD patients with a baseline 300-400 meter 6MWD had p-values of less than 0.05, due to the sequential testing method, these p-values are considered nominal.\nTypically, a trial result is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring when the treatment is like placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less than 0.05. Nominal p-values cannot be compared to the typical significance level (p-value less than 0.05) to determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups, end points or analyses of subgroups.\nBecause of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greater weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values.\nOn February 22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA stating that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. Our reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data and our use of retrospective analyses had a negative impact on the FDA\u2019s view of our interpretation of the results of our Phase 2b trial, ACT DMD and the totality of data from our clinical trials.\nAlthough we recently filed our NDA over protest with the FDA, there is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any dialogue we have had or any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, pursuant to the file over protest process or otherwise, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials. Even if we are successful in resolving some or all of the matters raised by the FDA in the Refuse to File letter, there is significant risk that we will be unable to obtain FDA approval of Translarna for nmDMD, on a timely basis or at all, and we may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials or complete additional analyses at significant cost. Even if we are able to enroll and fund any such additional trials or complete such analyses, there is substantial risk that the results would not ultimately support the approval of the NDA filed over protest or a new NDA submission in the United States for Translarna for nmDMD. In addition, any such requirement for additional trials would most likely result in our inability to\nsell Translarna in the United States for a significant period of time, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nOur reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data and our use of retrospective analyses has also had a negative impact on the EMA\u2019s evaluation of our last application for continued marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including delays in timing of the CHMP\u2019s opinion with respect to the annual renewal of our marketing authorization, and could negatively impact regulatory determinations by regulators in other territories.\nAn unfavorable view of our data and analyses by the FDA and EMA for Translarna has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain authorizations to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. An inability to obtain new marketing authorizations or maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA would have a material adverse effect on our revenue from Translarna and would materially harm our business, financial results and results of operations.\nBecause we are developing our product and our product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the outcome of our clinical trials will not be favorable.\nThere are no marketed therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of nmDMD. In addition, there has been limited historical clinical trial experience generally for the development of drugs to treat nmDMD and other diseases that we are studying or have studied, including, nmCF, nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for these diseases, particularly for drugs to address the underlying nonsense mutations causing these diseases in some subsets of patients, is subject to increased risk.\nFor example, on March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF, our Phase 3 clinical for Translarna in nmCF and that, as a result, we plan to discontinue our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF.\nPrior to the Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD, there was no precedent of an established trial design to evaluate the efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD over a 48 week duration. In addition, clinical understanding of the methodologies used to analyze the resulting data were also limited. The study design and enrollment criteria for ACT DMD were based on available natural history data of the disease, including third party data and results from our Phase 2b clinical trial. An evolving understanding in the DMD community has led to a greater appreciation of the optimal window for the 6MWT in assessing physical function. We believe that this factor may have led to the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat population not achieving statistical significance in ACT DMD.\nWe are faced with similar challenges in connection with the design of our studies of Translarna in nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 because there is also limited historical clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat the underlying cause of these disorders.\nFor example, with respect to nmMPS I, while clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapies conducted by third party sponsors have provided some insight into the disorder, enzyme replacement therapies do not sufficiently address the central nervous system, skeletal or cardiac symptoms associated with the disorder. In addition, our own pre-clinical and early stage clinical trials targeting nmMPS I have been limited in duration and, as a result, it is substantially uncertain whether our clinical design will optimize the duration or level of dosing or that we will be able to demonstrate a statistically significant biochemical or clinical effect in the primary or secondary pre-specified endpoints selected for the study.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including Study 041 or our Phase 2 studies of Translarna in nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, or nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials. The studies under our SMA collaboration face similar risks.\nEach of the indications we are currently pursuing are characterized by relatively small patient populations, which could result in slow enrollment of clinical trial participants. The feasibility of patient enrollment was a critical factor discussed with the EMA in connection with the specific obligation to conduct Study 041, in particular due to factors that increase the challenges of enrollment, such as the small nmDMD patient population, the patient eligibility criteria for the mITT for Study 041, and the fact that Translarna is available to patients in the EEA and other limited territories pursuant to commercial and EAP programs.\nIn addition, our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates. As a result, potential clinical trial sites may elect to dedicate their limited resources to participation in our\ncompetitors\u2019 clinical trials and not ours, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nperceived benefits and risks of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in Study 041 or our Phase 2 studies of Translarna in nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 or any of our, or our collaboration partners\u2019, other clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. As the conduct of Study 041 is a specific obligation to our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, any such delay or inability to enroll sufficient patients could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our authorization in the EEA and, failure to maintain such authorization would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance.\nIn addition, during the first quarter of 2015, we amended the study design for our proof-of-concept study for Translarna for the treatment of nmMPS I to include patients currently on enzyme replacement therapy, which contributed to delays in site initiation and patient accrual. Despite the protocol amendment, we have continued to encounter difficulties identifying qualified patients for this study.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of Translarna or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product or product candidate.\nOur product and our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. If our product or product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a benefit-risk perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nFor example, although we did not observe a pattern of liver enzyme elevations in our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna, we did observe modest elevations of liver enzymes in some subjects in one of our Phase 1 clinical trials. These elevated enzyme levels did not require cessation of Translarna administration, and enzyme levels typically normalized after completion of the treatment phase. We did not observe any increases in bilirubin, which can be associated with serious harm to the liver, in the Phase 1 clinical trial.\nIn addition, in Study 009, our first Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, five adverse events in the Translarna arm of the trial that involved the renal system led to discontinuation. As compared to the placebo group, the Translarna treatment arm also had a higher incidence of adverse events of creatinine elevations, which can be an indication of impaired kidney function. In the Translarna treatment arm, more severe clinically meaningful creatinine elevations were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine elevations were associated with concomitant treatment with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of concomitant use of Translarna and these antibiotics, which was successful in addressing this issue in the clinical trial.\nOur focus on the discovery and development of product candidates that target post-transcriptional control processes is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop products of any, or sustained, commercial value.\nOur scientific approach focuses on the discovery and development of product candidates that target post-transcriptional control processes. While a number of commonly used drugs and a growing body of research validate the importance of post-\ntranscriptional control processes in the origin and progression of a number of diseases, no existing drugs have been specifically designed to alter post-transcriptional control processes in the same manner as Translarna or our other product candidates. As a result, our focus on targeting these processes may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable drugs that safely and effectively treat genetic disorders or other diseases.\nFor example, on March 2, 2017, we announced that the primary and secondary endpoints were not achieved in ACT CF and that, as a result, we plan to discontinue our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF. We have withdrawn our type II variation submission with the EMA, which sought approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the EEA.\nIn addition, although we have received marketing authorization by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, such marketing authorization is subject to the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA and is also subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA. In 2016, the FDA refused to file our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, noting that both the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness.\nWe may not be successful in renewing our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA or in obtaining full regulatory approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or any indication or for any other potentially commercially viable drug that treats an approved indication by targeting a particular post-transcriptional control process. Furthermore, we may not receive regulatory approval for product candidates that target different post-transcriptional control processes. If we fail to develop and commercialize viable drugs, we will not achieve commercial success.\nTranslarna for the treatment of nmDMD, or any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization, if any, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nAlthough Translarna is currently authorized by the EMA for marketing for the treatment of nmDMD such marketing authorization is subject to the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA and is also subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA. Even if our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is maintained, or we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization for Translarna for other indications or territories or marketing authorization for any of our other product candidates, such product may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our product or product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer our product or product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nIn addition, because we are developing Translarna for the treatment of different indications, negative results in a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of Translarna for one indication, such as our recent ACT CF trial results, could have a negative impact on the perception of the efficacy of Translarna in a different indication, which could have an adverse effect on our commercialization efforts and financial results.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, including Latin America. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar\ndevelopments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing authorization.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product or product candidates, we may not be successful in our continuing efforts to commercialize Translarna or commercializing any other product candidate if and when they are approved.\nOur experience in the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical products is limited to our activities under the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual review and renewal following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA and satisfaction of the specific obligation to conduct Study 041. We may be unable to successfully execute our commercial strategy for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in other territories, including, if approved, in the United States, or for other indications or product candidates that may receive marketing authorization, if any.\nOur ongoing commercial strategy for Translarna involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions and is heavily dependent upon our ability to continue to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our global commercial strategy. International operations are subject to inherent risks. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to develop our commercial organizations in all intended territories in a timely manner or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize Translarna in those jurisdictions in which it is or may be approved will be adversely affected. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue consistent with our expectations and may not become profitable.\nWe have evaluated markets outside of the EEA to determine in which geographies we might, if approved, choose to commercialize Translarna ourselves and in which geographies we might choose to collaborate with third parties. We intend to continue to promote Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in permitted territories using both internal and external resources.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training an internal commercial team is expensive and time consuming and could delay our commercialization efforts for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or any other product launch. If the commercial launch of Translarna or any other product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition such personnel.\nThe arrangements that we have entered into, or may enter into, with third parties to perform sales and marketing services will generate lower product revenues or profitability of product revenues to us than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nFactors that may materially affect our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement third party marketing and distribution relationships on favorable terms, or at all, in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our commercial team to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe Translarna or any future products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by our commercial team, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\nAny of these factors, individually or as a group, if not resolved in a favorable manner may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similar risks apply in those territories where Translarna is available on a reimbursed basis under an EAP program.\nAll of our sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD currently occur in territories outside of the United States, which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nAll of our revenue from sales of Translarna to date has been generated from countries other than the United States. We have operations in multiple European countries and other territories, including Latin America. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future, including in emerging growth markets, pending successful completion of the applicable regulatory processes. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, regulatory, compliance and economic developments that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, including import or export licensing requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in particular foreign economies and markets, in particular in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations and business practices; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 and service providers\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act or similar local regulation.\nFor example, we face risks arising out of the potential uncertainty caused by the recent vote in the United Kingdom in favor of exiting the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been adversely affected by Brexit and, in the event that such foreign exchange volatility were to continue, it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results. In addition, if the United Kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the pharmaceutical industry, we could face significant new regulatory costs and challenges.\nIn addition, some of the countries in which Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is available for sale are in emerging markets and we anticipate that Translarna will become available to new emerging markets during 2017. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global or regional financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care, including Brazil. We also may be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many emerging market countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in some countries, including Brazil, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales. Other factors may also contribute to fluctuations in quarterly net product sales including Tranlarna\u2019s availability in any particular territory, government actions, economic pressures, political unrest and other factors. Net product sales are impacted by factors, such as the timing of decisions by regulatory authorities, in particular the FDA and the EMA with respect to our ability to market or sell Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nThere is currently no marketed therapy, other than Translarna in the EEA, which has received approval for the treatment of the underlying cause of nmDMD. Sarepta Therapeutics recently received approval in the United States for a treatment addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments for the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene (Sarepta, Daiichi Sankyo, and Nippon Shinyaku).\nAldurazyme, which is manufactured by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and sold by Genzyme Corporation, is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I. Furthermore, Diacomit is marketed in the European Union by Laboratoires Biocodex for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, including GW Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix, and Insys Therapeutics. Aniridia therapeutic interventions, such as artificial iris implantation, are being developed by HumanOptics AG. Our SMA collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation also faces competition. For example, in December 2016, the FDA approved nusinersen, a drug developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and marketed by Biogen, to treat SMA. AveXis, Inc. is also evaluating a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of SMA. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Trophos (also in collaboration with Roche), Kowa, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Cytokinetics.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain marketing authorization for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nWe believe that many competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for the target indications of our product candidates, including academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller more focused companies.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on a broad scale or commercialize Translarna for other indications or any other product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nWe believe that Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has been and will continue to be priced at levels consistent with the pricing for other therapies for the treatment of rare disorders where high unmet medical need exists, although, for the reasons discussed below, there can be no assurance in this regard.\nThe regulations and practices that govern marketing authorizations, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries, including almost all of the member states of the EEA, require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, including the European market, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing authorization for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing authorization.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Translarna or any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the EU and U.S. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Prices at which our products are reimbursed can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts off the products\u2019 list prices and are challenging the prices manufacturers charge for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for Translarna or any other product that we may commercialize and, if coverage is available, the level of reimbursement is also uncertain. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product or product candidate for which we obtain marketing authorization. Obtaining reimbursement for Translarna has been and is expected to be particularly difficult because of the significant research and development challenges and costs and resulting price considerations typically associated with drugs that are developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, such as prior authorization requirements. If reimbursement is not available or is available only on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product or product candidate for which we have obtained or may obtain marketing authorization.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nNet prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors include federal health care programs, such as Medicare Medicaid, TRICARE, and Veterans Health Administration programs; managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Several of the U.S. federal health care programs require that drug manufacturers extend discounts or pay rebates to certain programs in order for their products to be covered and reimbursed. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered outpatient drugs to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the federal government as a condition for coverage of the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drug(s) by state Medicaid programs. Similarly, in order for a covered outpatient drug to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts on the covered outpatient drug to entities that are enrolled and participating in the 340B drug pricing program. In addition, U.S. private health insurers often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Payment by private payors is subject to payor-determined coverage and reimbursement policies that vary considerably and are subject to change without notice.\nIn addition, there has been recent negative publicity and increasing legislative and public scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S. Moreover, U.S. government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate drug prices and reimbursement, often with particular focus on new and innovative therapies. These dynamics may give rise to heightened attention and potential negative reactions to pricing decisions for products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability. Moreover, we expect that the new Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress may seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as the Affordable Care Act), which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by the federal and state healthcare programs as well as plans in the private health insurance market.\nIn the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for our product or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing authorization, or a reduction in coverage for payment rates for our product or any such product candidates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in the European Union, for medicines authorized by the centralized authorization procedure, an\nauthorized trader, such as a wholesaler, can purchase a medicine in one EU member state and import the product into another EU member state. This process is called \u201cparallel distribution\u201d. As a result, a purchaser in one EU member state may seek to import Translarna from another EU member state where Translarna is sold at a lower price. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the commercialization of Translarna, any other product that we may commercialize, and in connection with the human clinical trials testing of our product candidates and the sales of our products, including Translarna and any other product that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs, or an inability to maintain appropriate insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our commercial sales, sales pursuant to reimbursed EAP programs and clinical trials up to a $25.0 million annual aggregate limit, and subject to a per claim deductible. The amount of insurance we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities and defense costs that we may incur. We may need to further increase our insurance coverage as we continue commercializing Translarna or as and when we begin commercializing any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization. The cost of insurance coverage is highly variable, based on a wide range of factors, and is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability or defense costs that may arise.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations currently, and may in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and medical and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials or disposal of hazardous wastes, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We also maintain liability insurance for some of these risks, but our liability policy excludes pollution and has an aggregate coverage limit of $11.0 million.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other\nindications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, we initiated separate Phase 2 clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of hemophilia in 2009 and the metabolic disorder methylmalomic acidemia in 2010, but then suspended these clinical trials to focus on the development of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF when we found variability in the assays used in these trials and preliminary data from these trials did not indicate definitive evidence of activity. In March 2017, we discontinued our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF based on the negative outcome of a Phase 3 clinical trial. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts on small-molecule drugs that target post-transcriptional control processes. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in proprietary technologies, including our GEMS, nonsense mutation and alternative splicing technologies, which we use in the discovery of these molecules, to date we have only been granted marketing authorization in the EEA to treat nmDMD under a restricted label that is subject to the specific obligation to conduct Study 041 as well as annual renewal and reassessment requirements. We may not be able to successfully renew or satisfy the ongoing requirements of our current marketing authorization for nmDMD in the EEA and we may never successfully develop any other marketable drugs or indications using our scientific approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates\nOur marketing authorization in the EEA is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 by September 2021, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of our marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nConditional marketing authorizations based on incomplete clinical data, including our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, may be granted in the EEA for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under EU law, if (1) the EMA determines that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations or conditions, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations subject to conditions are only valid for one year, and must be renewed annually by the European Commission after an assessment by the EMA of the ongoing positive benefit-risk balance in favor of continued authorization and the need for additional or modified conditions.\nWe received initial marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older from the European Commission in August 2014 as a \u201cconditional marketing authorization.\u201d The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our satisfaction of the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 by September 2021to the EEA. We are also required to implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans, which are detailed in the risk management plan.\nOur marketing authorization was previously conditioned upon our submission to the EMA of the final efficacy and safety report from ACT DMD during 2015. Although we have fulfilled the condition to submit the ACT DMD report to the EMA, that trial did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in distance walked in the 6-minute walk test. The EMA and European Commission did not approve our request for full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and, instead, approved the renewal of our conditional marketing authorization with the specific\nobligation to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged 5 years or older via Study 041.\nEnrolling, conducting and reporting a clinical trial is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we expect that we will incur material costs related to the implementation and conduct of Study 041. We expect that conducting a placebo-controlled trial in nmDMD of this size will be challenging and it is probable that we will enroll patients in territories where Translarna has already become available on a reimbursed basis. We may enroll patients in countries with a different standard of care for nmDMD patients or at clinical trial sites that are inexperienced with clinical trials in general, or specifically with nmDMD trials. In addition, we may experience unknown complications with Study 041 and may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance, which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA.\nIf we fail to satisfy our obligations under the marketing authorization, or if it is determined in any annual renewal cycle that the balance of benefits and risks of using Translarna has changed materially, the European Commission could, at the EMA\u2019s recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna. The EMA may also impose other new conditions to our marketing authorization (in addition to Study 041), and may make other recommendations, including new label restrictions. In the event that we do secure annual renewal of the marketing authorization for any given annual renewal cycle, the EMA could nevertheless later determine that we have not complied, or are unable to comply, with any conditions that have been or may be placed on the marketing authorization, including those related to Study 041, which could result in the withdrawal of our marketing authorization or other outcome that would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our marketing authorization in the EEA is not renewed, or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is substantial risk that the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and we will be unable to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States in a timely manner, or at all, whether pursuant to the file over protest process or otherwise, and by determining to file our NDA over protest, we have postponed other available strategic pathways which may have proven to be more effective. If there are delays in obtaining regulatory approval in the United States, we will not be able to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD in that territory and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. In the event that the FDA requires us to conduct a new clinical trial in nmDMD which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission by us, we would expect to incur significant costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2015, we completed our rolling new drug application, or NDA, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD with the FDA. In February 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding this NDA. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, we were notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA, both of our Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. During the third quarter of 2016, we filed an appeal of the FDA\u2019s decision refuse to file the NDA, which was denied in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRather than continue our appeal under the formal dispute resolution process, we recently filed the NDA over protest with the FDA and the agency granted a standard review for the NDA and has set a PDUFA target review date of October 24, 2017, which is not binding on the agency. There can be no assurance that the FDA will complete its review of our NDA by the PDUFA goal date.\nFiling over protest is a procedural path permitted by FDA regulations that allows a company to have its NDA filed and reviewed when there is a disagreement with regulators over the acceptability of the NDA submission. When an application is filed over protest, the FDA is required to review the application as filed. Generally, the FDA does not favor the file over protest procedure and the agency\u2019s policies explain that an application filed over protest does not receive a timeline for review and is designated as a standard review.\nThere is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any dialogue we have had or any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, pursuant to the file over protest process or otherwise, that we will continue to be unable to resolve the matters raised by the FDA in its Refuse to File letter in a timely manner, or at all. Even if we are successful in resolving some or all of those matters, there is significant risk that the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials and we will be unable to obtain FDA approval of Translarna for nmDMD, on a\ntimely basis or at all. We may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials or analyses at significant cost. Even if we are able to enroll and fund any such additional trials or analyses, there is substantial risk that the results would not ultimately support the approval of the NDA filed over protest or a new NDA submission with the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the U.S. In addition, any such requirement for additional trials would most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the United States for a significant period of time, if ever, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nFor example, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the FDA in connection with the agency\u2019s refuse to file our NDA submitted for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD that was based on our Phase 2b data. In January 2012, the FDA reaffirmed the appropriateness of its earlier decision to refuse to file the 2011 NDA. In February 2012, we discussed the design of a proposed Phase 3 clinical trial with the FDA. In that meeting, although the FDA indicated that the adequacy of data for filing and approval of an NDA would remain review issues, the FDA had no objections to key elements of our proposed trial design. We ultimately submitted the safety and efficacy data of that Phase 3 trial, ACT DMD, as part of the NDA that is the subject of the current file over protest procedure. In its 2016 Refuse to File letter, the FDA referenced its prior refusal to file relative to the Phase 2b data and our discussions with the FDA, reiterating the views previously disclosed.\nFurthermore, we expect that our efforts to advance our regulatory strategy in the United States will be time-consuming and may be expensive. In addition, by determining to discontinue our strategy of appealing the FDA\u2019s refusal to file our NDA and pursue the file over protest strategy, we have postponed other strategic pathways, such as escalating our appeal to the next supervisory level of the FDA, commencing direct litigation, or discussing the design of a new clinical trial with the FDA. Such alternative strategies may be more effective than the file over protest procedure in achieving our ultimate goal of approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States. We will not be able to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD in the United States until we have obtained regulatory approval from the FDA. Delays in obtaining such approval will materially impair our ability to generate revenue from Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nFor additional information concerning recent developments that have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to advance our regulatory strategy for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, please review the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates\u201d titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nIf we are not able to comply with local regulations for our product or product candidates, we will not be able to obtain or maintain product approvals and commercialize our product or product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nTranslarna and our product candidates, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and EMA and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain or renew marketing authorization for Translarna or any product candidate will prevent us from commercializing such product or product candidate.\nAs noted in the foregoing risk factors, we may not receive necessary approvals from the FDA, the EMA, or other regulators to further commercialize Translarna for nmDMD or to commercialize Translarna for any other indication or commercialize any product candidate in any market. For example, in March 2017, we discontinued our current clinical development of Translarna for nmCF based on the outcome of our Phase 3 clinical trial, ACT CF, and have withdrawn our type II variation submission with the EMA, which we had commenced in the third quarter of 2015 to seek approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the EEA. We do not currently expect to pursue other marketing authorizations for this indication.\nWe have not proven our ability to successfully obtain marketing authorizations to sell our product or product candidates, other than with respect to the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in August 2014 for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual review and renewal following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA and satisfaction of any conditions that may be imposed by the EMA, including the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 and our marketing authorizations in Israel and South Korea (which are largely contingent upon continued EMA approval). We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA. There is substantial risk that regulators in other territories will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue, or may prevent us from generating any revenue, from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in those territories.\nWe have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing authorizations for product candidates and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing authorization requires the timely preparation and submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. In response to changes in the regulatory environment or requests from regulators, we may elect, or be obliged, to postpone a regulatory submission to include additional analyses, including those intended to strengthen our submission or facilitate regulator review, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Securing marketing authorization also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that Translarna or any of our other product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing authorization or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing authorizations is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing authorization policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing authorization of a product candidate. Any marketing authorization we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. For example, the marketing authorization granted on a conditional basis by the EMA in the EEA for Translarna is limited to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged five years and older who have been identified through genetic testing and is subject to the specific obligation to conduct Study 041 and annual reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk analysis.\nIn addition, marketing authorizations in countries outside the United States do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing authorizations and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for their products and those products are determined by the FDA to be the \u201csame drug\u201d as our product candidate(s) under applicable FDA standards, or if those products can be classified as a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d within the meaning of EU law, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, nmCF, nmMPS I, and nonsense mutation aniridia. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to RG7916, a compound under development in our SMA collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable market exclusivity period is currently ten years in the European Union and seven years in the United States. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. However, in the European Union, generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier of an authorized medicinal product, a \u201creference product\u201d, may not be placed on the market for 10 years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the reference product. In addition, the respective orphan designation and exclusivity frameworks in the United States and in the European Union are subject to change, and any such changes may affect our ability to obtain, or the impact of obtaining, EU or U.S. orphan designations in the future.\nIn the European Union, a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. For a drug such as Translarna, which is composed of small molecules, the FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, both in the European Union and in the United States, may be important to the product candidate\u2019s success. If a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as Translarna before we do and if the competitor\u2019s product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from the market for a\nperiod of time. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as Translarna is shown to be \u201cclinically superior\u201d to our product candidate as determined by the FDA, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as Translarna if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. The same considerations would apply to any of our orphan product candidates.\nAll pharmaceutical products for which marketing authorization has been granted, including Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nWe, Translarna, our product candidates, our operations, our facilities, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers, distributors, and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the EEA, the United States, and other territories, with regulations differing from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the EEA, the United States, or other territories until we have received requisite regulatory approvals. In order to receive and maintain such approvals, we and our third-party service providers must comply on a continuous basis with a broad array of regulations related to establishment registration and product listing, manufacturing processes, risk management measures, quality and pharmacovigilance systems, pre- and post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, record keeping, distribution, and import and export of pharmaceutical products for any product for which we obtain marketing authorization. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. For example, our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, as well as the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing and distribution. For additional information with respect to the risks related to renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, see the foregoing risk factor titled \u201cOur marketing authorization in the EEA is a \u201cconditional marketing authorization\u201d that requires annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization and is further conditioned upon our ability to satisfy the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041 by September 2021, and, as such, there is ongoing risk that we may be unable to maintain such authorization. If we are unable to obtain renewal of our marketing authorization in any future renewal cycle, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from product sales, whether pursuant to a commercial or an EAP program and throughout all territories, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nWe are required to submit safety and other post-market information and reports, implement pharmacovigilance plans, and comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements related to manufacturing including, quality control, quality assurance and complaints and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to healthcare professionals and recordkeeping, among other things, in connection with the marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD described above. Regulatory authorities, including the EMA and local regulatory authorities in EEA member states, subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to ongoing review and periodic inspections and the EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections, undertaken by the competent authorities of applicable member states, of our manufacturing facilities to assess whether our manufacturing, and other procedures, comply with cGMP. Similar regulatory and inspection requirements apply in other jurisdictions including those imposed by the FDA in the United States. The FDA will typically inspect a manufacturer, including its contract manufacturer organizations and clinical research organizations, following acceptance of an NDA, which can delay FDA approval, especially if unsatisfactory inspection results are observed. If an FDA inspection were to occur and compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers or research organizations were identified, it could also result in disruption of production or distribution of a product or product candidate, or require substantial resources to correct.\nEven if marketing authorization of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or may be subject to significant conditions of approval, including the requirement of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS. A regulatory authority also may impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, the competent authorities of each EU member state and the FDA closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. Such regulatory authorities can impose stringent restrictions on our communications regarding off-label use and if we do not comply with the laws governing promotion of approved drugs, we may be subject to enforcement\naction for off-label promotion. For example, violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to civil and criminal penalties, investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results which could negatively affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nchanges to or restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to implement a REMS;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing authorizations;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n\u2022\ndebarment.\nNon-compliance with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nWe are also subject to laws and license and registration requirements covering the distribution of marketed products. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be subject to action by regulatory agencies, which could negatively affect our business. Regulatory agencies may also change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements.\nOur initial commercial launch of Translarna has begun in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the EEA, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and may have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the country. We generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to the conditional marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country. In some countries we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies of our product, including trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. We may not be able to conclude pricing and reimbursement negotiations or comply with additional regulatory requirements in the countries in which we seek to commercialize Translarna on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take over 18 months to complete. Pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. We cannot predict the timing of Translarna\u2019s commercial launch in countries where we are awaiting pricing and reimbursement guidelines. While we have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in many EEA countries, we have only received both pricing and reimbursement approval on terms that are acceptable to us in a limited number of countries.\nThe price that is approved by governmental authorities in any country pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under our reimbursed EAP programs. In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.\nFor example, in France, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. We will make such retroactive reimbursement, if any, following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.\nFurther, based on unsustainable economics imposed by the arbitration board in Germany upon the recent conclusion of an arbitration process with us and the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances, we delisted Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system, effective April 1, 2016. While some patients and healthcare professionals in Germany have been able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law, there can be no assurance that other patients or healthcare professionals in Germany will be successful doing so or, if initially successful, that any or all will continue to be successful. We were required to reimburse payors in Germany the difference between the commercial price of Translarna and the price established by the arbitration board in Germany for sales made in Germany after December 2015, other than sales made pursuant to the reimbursed importation pathway.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations and there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. For example, these factors influenced the length of our pricing and reimbursement negotiations in England, which took place between mid-2014 to mid-2016, and culminated in a five-year managed access agreement between us, National Health Services England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, NorthStar clinical network and the patient organisations Muscular Dystrophy UK and Action Duchenne. The managed access agreement establishes the clinical details surrounding the use of Translarna, including the terms and conditions of a confidential financial arrangement and the collection of further data on the efficacy of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD with NICE guidance to be reviewed again at the end of the five-year period, before future funding decisions are taken.\nIn addition, adverse clinical and regulatory developments may exacerbate these risks, including the developments noted in the foregoing risk factor titled, \u201cACT DMD did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and there is substantial risk that regulators will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\u201d\nReference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices and revenues. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.\nIf we fail to successfully secure and maintain pricing and reimbursement coverage for Translarna or are significantly delayed in doing so or if burdensome conditions are imposed by private payers, government authorities or other third-party payers on such reimbursement, planned launches in the affected countries will be delayed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, patients, patient organizations, and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products or product candidates, including Translarna, for which we have obtained or may obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing authorization.\nFailure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nRestrictions and reporting requirements under applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and equivalent laws and regulations in the European Union and other countries in which we operate, include, and are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nAnti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act, and similar statutes which have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, by other countries in which we operate and with which we are or may be required to comply.\n\u2022\nAnti-kickback laws and regulations, including those applicable in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries where we operate, which generally prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under government funded healthcare programs. The U.S. federal statute imposes criminal penalties and has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others and many states have enacted equivalent state laws that apply not only to government payors but to commercial payors as well.\n\u2022\nFalse claim laws and regulations, including the U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws, which may permit civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and may impose civil liability and criminal penalties on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations related to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and similar state laws, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and may impose criminal and civil liability for violations of these obligations. In addition, international data protection laws including the European Union Data Protection Directive and member state implementing legislation may apply to some or all of the clinical data obtained, transmitted, or stored outside of the United States. Furthermore, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals\u2019 health information.\nHIPAA also imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations governing the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and patients, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, legislation adopted by individual EU member states that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product\u2019s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations regulating off-label promotion of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at European Union level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other laws, if any of our product candidates are approved, we would be prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means, for example, that we would not be able to make claims about the use of our marketed products outside of their approved indications, and we would not be able to proactively discuss or provide information on off-label uses of such products, with very specific and limited exceptions. Should the FDA determine that our activities constituted the promotion of off-label use, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing those products for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations requiring that we disclose publicly payments made to physicians, including in certain EU member states and the United States. For example, in the U.S., under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements, manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies must report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. A number of U.S. states and other countries have enacted their own transparency requirements that obligate manufacturers to report different types of spending related to physicians, certain hospitals, and other covered recipients.\nIn addition, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct. In the U.S., some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with these industry and physician codes and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national laws of the EU member states, as well as codes of conduct issued by self-regulatory industry bodies. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, their competent professional organization, and the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws, regulations, transparency requirements and self-regulatory codes have and will continue to involve substantial costs. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, our third-party contractors, or the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations and codes. It is possible that governmental authorities could conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs would adversely affect, perhaps materially, our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any drug. Even if we were not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry or the healthcare system more broadly may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain or maintain marketing authorization of and commercialize our product and product candidates and affect the coverage and reimbursement we may obtain.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing authorization of Translarna or any of our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates, including Translarna, for which we obtain marketing authorization.\nCertain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. For example, in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own policies. Therefore, any restrictions to coverage or reductions in reimbursement that result from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar coverage restriction or reimbursement reduction from private payors. In addition, private payors may implement coverage restrictions or payment reductions independently from federal programs such as Medicare.\nSimilarly, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. However, the new Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress have expressed a desire to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act, which has contributed to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and also underscores the potential for additional reform going forward. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize Translarna and our product candidates. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. We cannot predict how future changes relating to healthcare reform in the European Union, the United States, or other territories, will affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted in any territory in which we are authorized, or become authorized, to market Translarna or any of our other product candidates, or whether applicable regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing authorizations of our product or product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process or by comparable foreign bodies overseeing regulatory authorities in other territories may significantly delay or prevent marketing authorization, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. We cannot predict how future changes relating to pre- and post-marketing approval and requirements will affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our product and our product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production or distribution of clinical or commercial supplies of our product candidates. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Translarna and all of our product candidates. We outsource all manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our products and product candidates to third parties, including our commercial supply of Translarna.\nWe currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the bulk drug substance for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers and the bulk drug substance for our cancer stem cell program through another third-party manufacturer. We engage two separate manufacturers to provide bulk drug product. We have a relationship with three manufacturers that are capable of providing fill and finish services for our finished commercial and clinical product, although we are still in the process of finalizing arrangements with one of these manufacturers with respect to commercial product services. We anticipate completing applicable validation procedures for this manufacturer in 2017 for both commercial and clinical product.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna or any of our product candidates, although we may seek to establish such arrangements in the future. In the event that we are unable to procure supply from a validated manufacturer, we would seek to identify and qualify replacement suppliers, however this process would likely result in delays in our ability to supply Translarna to patients or in advance our clinical trials. We may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe currently have a contract with a pharmacy and hospital distributor in the European Union that distributes Translarna for clinical programs and limited commercial and EAP programs. We have engaged with third party logistic providers, or 3PLs, which distribute Translarna for the majority of our commercial and EAP programs on our behalf. We intend to engage additional distributors if and when, if ever, we become authorized to make Translarna available for purchase in such additional geographies.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers and distributors, reliance on such service providers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of commercial supplies of Translarna not being distributed to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nMany additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of Translarna and any of our product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, contamination, or raw material shortages.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers or distributors may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, or good distribution practice, or GDP, or similar regulatory requirements outside the European Union and the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or distributors, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or product, operating restrictions, criminal prosecutions or debarment, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of Translarna or our product candidates.\nOur product and our product candidates and any other products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nIf the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our commercial sales, preclinical tests and clinical trials should, prior to the time that we have validated alternative providers, cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna to patients or in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of Translarna or our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, we will lose commercial sales revenue and it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and distribution of Translarna and our product candidates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and limit our ability to grow including our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize our products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product or product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Similar GCP and transparency requirements apply in the European Union. Failure to comply with such requirements, including with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the European Union and United States, can also lead regulatory authorities to refuse to take into account clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing application.\nFor example, in the first half of 2013 inspectors acting at the request of the EMA conducted GCP inspections of selected clinical sites from our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our clinical trial site relating to our then pending marketing authorization application for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following these inspections, we received inspection reports containing a combination of critical and major findings. These findings related to waivers we granted to admit patients to our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in advance of formal approval of protocol amendments that would have established their eligibility for the trial, as well as our oversight of our trial sites and the completeness or sufficiency of clinical trial documentation. In response to these findings, we described to the EMA the enhanced internal procedures and controls we have implemented, and the internal quality assurance\ndepartment we have established, since the conclusion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, we proposed corrective action plans to address the inspectors\u2019 specific findings. If we do not meet our commitment to the corrective actions we proposed to the EMA, we may face additional consequences, including rejection of data or other direct action by national regulatory authorities, which could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other supportive studies to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain full approval from the EMA.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing authorizations for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing authorizations.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing authorizations of our product or product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nFor each of our product candidates, we plan to evaluate the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves or entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, such as our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, for our spinal muscular atrophy program. We have entered into arrangements with certain third parties to market or distribute Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in certain countries and, as we continue to implement our commercialization plans for Translarna, we anticipate that we will engage additional third parties to perform these functions for us in other countries. We generally plan to seek collaborators for the development and commercialization of product candidates that have high anticipated development costs, are directed at indications for which a potential collaborator has a particular expertise, or involve markets that require a large sales and marketing organization to serve effectively. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements may include: large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies.\nWe will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 desire and ability to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In particular, the successful development of a product candidate from our spinal muscular atrophy program will initially depend on the success of our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, including whether Roche continues clinical development of the current clinical candidate or pursues clinical development of any other compounds identified under the collaborations.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates, including our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborator and us as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n\u2022\nwe may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaborators have terminated collaborations with us in the past. For example, in 2008, we entered into a collaboration with Genzyme Corporation for the development and commercialization of Translarna under which we granted to Genzyme rights to commercialize Translarna in all countries other than the United States and Canada. In 2011, we restructured the collaboration and regained worldwide rights to Translarna, with Genzyme obtaining an option to commercialize Translarna in indications other than nmDMD outside the United States and Canada. In 2012, this option expired without being exercised by Genzyme and the collaboration terminated.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate further with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborators\u2019 resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborators\u2019 evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge; and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under such license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose rights in important intellectual property or technology.\nWe have also received grant funding for some of our development programs from philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups pursuant to agreements that impose development and commercialization diligence obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the applicable organization could require us to grant to the organization exclusive rights under certain of our intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect the value to us of product candidates covered by that intellectual property even if we are entitled to a share of any consideration received by such organization in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of the product candidates.\nSome of our patented technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. Furthermore, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and certain restrictions on manufacturing products outside the United States.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions related to our novel technologies, product and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering this intellectual property. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent law in many countries restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain or be able to pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions\nare typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (the \u201cAct\u201d), which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. The significant changes engendered by the Act include switching from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant, including inter partes review and post grant review.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party anonymously submitting prior art to a patent office or may become involved in addressing patentability objections based on third party submission of references, or may become involved in oppositions, derivation proceedings, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize our product or current or future product candidates.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. In addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, which may require us to allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data and other information, that would ordinarily be treated as trade secret, submitted as part of a marketing authorization application becoming publicly available. The EMA Policy on publication of clinical data and other such information, as well as the current application of European Union freedom of information regulations, could impact our proprietary information (comprising both clinical and non-clinical data and other information) that would normally be maintained by a regulatory body as commercially confidential. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data or other information to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources or engage in litigation to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents.\nFor example, during 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the European Union to prevent disclosure of this information, and in July 2016, the Court took the interim measure of ordering the EMA not to release our documents until the substantive case has been decided (by the General Court and/or in possible appeal proceedings). The EMA has appealed the interim measure to the Court of Justice of the European Union but the Court of Justice dismissed the appeal in the first quarter of 2017. While we expect to continue to object to the disclosure of any information that we consider commercially confidential, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the aforementioned litigation or in any future challenge that may be raised and we may not ultimately be successful in preventing disclosure of the data in our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nAn issued patent may be challenged as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged on such a basis in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or defenses, such that they do not infringe our intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or\nunenforceable. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that our patents are invalid and unenforceable or that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product and our product candidates. Since patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, with new publications occurring continuously, there may be patents or patent applications relating to our product or our product candidates that we are unaware of. There may also be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing Translarna. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether Translarna, or any of our other product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, would or would not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product or our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nFor example, it is possible that one or more third parties might bring a patent infringement or other legal proceeding against us regarding Translarna. We are aware of an issued U.S. patent and international patent applications that purport to disclose or contain claims to chemical scaffolds that are sufficiently broad that they could be read to encompass ataluren, the active ingredient in Translarna, even though neither the issued U.S. patent nor any of the international patents or patent applications specifically discloses ataluren. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent that may allegedly include ataluren within the scope of a granted claim, we would need to overcome that patent\u2019s presumption of validity in district court or prove unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence before the USPTO. There is no assurance that a court or the USPTO would find these claims to be invalid or unpatentable, respectively. In addition, we believe that the public notice given by our testing of ataluren in clinical trials for the purpose of seeking FDA approval would be a valid defense against any infringement claims in the United States based on the availability of any statutory research exemptions. However, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of the exemption would be upheld, were the exemption interpreted as covering only our preclinical research activities, and not the commercialization of ataluren.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment\nagreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur trademark applications may be refused registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or may be found to be unenforceable. During trademark examination proceedings, our trademark applications may be rejected. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may not be able to overcome them. In addition, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Trademark Offices in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications or to seek cancellation of registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In addition, if we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter difficulty enforcing our trademark rights against third parties in the jurisdictions where we do not have registered rights.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, including Translarna, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which could cause delays in getting such products to market and substantially increase our costs.\nTo protect our rights in any trademark we intend to use for our product or our product candidates, including Translarna, we may seek to register such trademarks. Trademark registration is territory-specific and we must apply for trademark registration in the United States as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA, and other regulatory authorities outside the United States, conduct an independent review of proposed product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other pharmaceutical product names for medications, which could result in medication errors in prescribing, dispensing and consumption. These regulatory authorities may also object to a proposed\nproduct name if they believe the name inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product or product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications and the rights attached thereto. Consequently, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product or our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Stuart W. Peltz, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and the other principal members of our executive and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe are in the process of expanding our development, regulatory, and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIn connection with our commercialization plans and business strategy, including our commercial launch of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we have experienced and may to continue to experience significant growth in our employee base for sales, marketing, operational, managerial, financial, human resources, drug development, quality, regulatory and medical affairs and other areas. This growth has imposed and will continue to impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit, hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. To manage our recent and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. In addition, we may need to adjust the size of our workforce as a result of changes to our expectations for our business, which can result in diversion of management attention, disruptions to our business, and related expenses. For example, following our receipt of the Refuse to File letter from the FDA in 2016, we implemented a reorganization of our operations in March 2016 that resulted in a one-time charge for the related work-force reduction. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nServicing the Convertible Notes will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August 2015, we incurred indebtedness in the amount of $150.0 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under the Convertible Notes, for which interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the Convertible Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and\nother factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the Convertible Notes. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we seek to refinance such indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase Convertible Notes, to pay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture, to make interest payments on the Convertible Notes when due under the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. An event of default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of any such related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Convertible Notes, make interest payments on the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, even if holders of the Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nany developments related to our ability or inability to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States in a timely manner or at all, whether pursuant to the file over protest process with the FDA, or otherwise, and including whether we will be required to complete any additional clinical and non-clinical trials or analyses;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA, which is subject to the specific obligation to conduct Study 041 and is also subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization by the EMA;\n\u2022\nany developments related to Study 041, including with respect to design, timing, conduct, and enrollment, and developments with respect to any clinical or non-clinical trial that may be required by other regulatory agencies, including the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of Translarna and any other product candidate that we develop;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nother developments concerning our regulatory submissions;\n\u2022\nwhether regulators in other territories agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD;\n\u2022\nour ability to advance the commercialization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe development and regulatory status of our SMA program with Roche and the SMA Foundation;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the subject of securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning litigation initiated against us and certain of our officers during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, we could be the target of other such litigation in the future. Class action and derivative lawsuits, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs, damage or settlement awards and a diversion of our management\u2019s resources and attention from running our business, which could materially harm our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently incurring and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and our management is and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. In addition, the failure to establish and maintain adequate finance infrastructure and accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have and will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. Compliance with Section 404, including documentation and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, is both costly and challenging. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the NASDAQ Stock Market or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe have issued a significant number of equity awards under our equity compensation plans or as inducement grants to new hire employees pursuant to Nasdaq rules. The shares underlying these awards are or, with respect to certain option grants, will be registered on a Form S-8 registration statement. As a result, upon vesting these shares can be freely exercised and sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. The exercise of options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock or the sale of restricted stock upon vesting could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain of our employees, executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors may also buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information.", "PERMNO": 13967, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTCT"}
