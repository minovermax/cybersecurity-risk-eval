You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed all known material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product, roxadustat, and our second compound in development, pamrevlumab.\nTo date, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development of roxadustat and pamrevlumab.\nWhile we have received approval of our marketing authorization applications for roxadustat in the European Union, Great Britain, the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d), Japan, South Korea, and Chile for chronic kidney disease (\u201cCKD\u201d) anemia for patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, we received a complete response letter (\u201cCRL\u201d) in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) from the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Our near-term prospects depend in part on our continued development of roxadustat in the U.S. and maintaining our collaboration with AstraZeneca AB (\u201cAstraZeneca\u201d). We are currently in discussions with AstraZeneca to determine a development path forward for CKD anemia and chemotherapy-induced anemia. We also continue to develop roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (\u201cMDS\u201d).\nOur near-term success also depends in large part on our other lead product candidate, pamrevlumab, which is currently in clinical development for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (\u201cIPF\u201d), locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (\u201cLAPC\u201d), metastatic pancreatic cancer, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (\u201cDMD\u201d). Pamrevlumab requires substantial further development and investment and we do not have a collaboration partner for support of this compound. In addition, pamrevlumab is a monoclonal antibody, which may require greater financial resources than for our small molecule, roxadustat.\nAs a company, we have limited commercialization experience, and the time and resources to develop such experience are significant. If we fail to achieve and sustain commercial success for roxadustat with our collaboration partners, our business would be harmed.\nWe do not have a sales infrastructure and we have limited experience in the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products in any country. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities or make and maintain our existing arrangements with third parties to perform these services at a level sufficient to support our commercialization efforts.\nTo the extent that we would undertake sales and marketing of any of our products directly, there are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively manage geographically dispersed commercial teams;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\nWith respect to roxadustat, we are dependent on the commercialization capabilities of our collaboration partners, AstraZeneca and Astellas Pharma Inc. (\u201cAstellas\u201d). If either such partner were to terminate its agreement with us, we would have to commercialize on our own or with another third party. We will have limited control over the commercialization efforts of such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products, if any, effectively. If they are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, our business and financial condition would suffer.\nCommercializing roxadustat requires us to establish commercialization systems, including but not limited to, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, supply-chain, and distribution capabilities to perform our portion of the collaborative efforts. These efforts require resources and time.\nIf we, along with Astellas and AstraZeneca, are not successful in our marketing, pricing and reimbursement strategies, facilitating adoption by dialysis organizations or health care professionals, recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, or if the market perception of roxadustat\u2019s safety and efficacy profile is negative, we will have difficulty commercializing roxadustat, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nDrug development and obtaining marketing authorization is a very difficult endeavor and we may ultimately be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our various product candidates in one or more jurisdictions and in one or more indications.\nThe development, manufacturing, marketing, and selling of our products and product candidates are and will continue to be subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S. and in other countries where we intend to develop and, if approved, market any product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical trials and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each indication for which approval is sought. The regulatory review and approval process is expensive and requires substantial resources and time, and in general, very few product candidates that enter development ultimately receive regulatory approval. In addition, our collaboration partners for roxadustat have final control over development decisions in their respective territories and they may make decisions with respect to development or regulatory authorities that delay or limit the potential approval of roxadustat, or increase the cost of development or commercialization. Accordingly, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize any of our other product candidates in one or more indications and jurisdictions.\nMoreover, for any clinical trial to support a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d)/Biologics License Application submission for approval, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with regulations and standards (including good clinical practices (\u201cGCP\u201d) requirements for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing, and reporting the results of clinical trials) to ensure that (1) the data and results from trials are credible and accurate; and (2) that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we as the sponsor remain responsible for ensuring that each of these clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol under legal and regulatory requirements, including GCP. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), trial sites, principal investigators or other third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable. Accordingly, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to exclude the use of patient data from these unreliable clinical trials, or perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may even reject our application for approval, or refuse to accept our future applications.\nRegulatory authorities may take actions or impose requirements that delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nour failure to adequately demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or an independent advisory committee that our product candidate is safe and effective in a particular indication, or that such product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nour failure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022\nthe determination by regulatory authorities that additional clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate,\n\u2022\ndisagreement over the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may exhibit an unacceptable safety signal at any stage of development;\n\u2022\nthe CROs or investigators that conduct clinical trials on our behalf may take actions outside of our control that do not comply with GCP, clinical trial protocols, or their agreement with us, or otherwise materially adversely impact our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndisagreement over whether to accept results from clinical trial sites in a country where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nwe or third-party contractors manufacturing our product candidates may not maintain current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), successfully pass inspection or meet other applicable manufacturing regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may not agree with our interpretation of the data from our preclinical trials and clinical trials; or\n\u2022\ncollaboration partners may not perform or complete their clinical programs in a timely manner, or at all.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our or our collaboration partners\u2019 abilities to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in one or more indications.\nThe FDA or other regulatory authorities may require more information (including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval), which may delay or prevent approval or cause us to abandon the development program altogether.\nEven if we believe our clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may not agree that our completed clinical trials provide adequate data on safety or efficacy. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by any other regulatory authority. For example, while we have received approval of our marketing authorization applications for roxadustat in the European Union, Great Britain, China, Japan, South Korea, and Chile for CKD anemia for patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, we received a CRL in the U.S. from the FDA regarding roxadustat\u2019s NDA for the treatment of anemia due to CKD, stating that it could not be approved in its present form. In addition, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nEven if we do obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, approval may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or approval may require labeling that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if our product candidates produce undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (or other regulatory authorities may require the establishment of a similar strategy), that may restrict distribution of our approved products, if any, and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us.\nAny of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nThe CRL we received from the FDA for roxadustat has decreased the likelihood of approval and successful commercialization of roxadustat in the U.S. and potentially other markets. This will decrease and/or delay expected revenue, and may increase the possibility that our Collaboration Agreement with AstraZeneca could be amended or terminated.\nIn August 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding roxadustat\u2019s NDA for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients, stating that it could not be approved in its present form. We are discussing the overall development and commercialization plan for roxadustat with our partner AstraZeneca and how the CRL and recent FDA feedback may affect those plans in the U.S. The CRL has decreased the likelihood of approval and successful commercialization of roxadustat in the U.S. and therefore will decrease and/or delay expected revenue. It is also possible that the CRL could negatively impact development or commercialization beyond CKD anemia within the U.S. and in CKD anemia and other indications outside the U.S. There is also an increased possibility that our U.S./RoW Collaboration Agreement with AstraZeneca could be amended or terminated. Any of these risks could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nPreclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial results may not be indicative of the results that may be obtained in larger clinical trials.\nClinical development is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical and early clinical trials, which are often highly variable and use small sample sizes, may not be predictive of similar results in humans or in larger, controlled clinical trials, and successful results from clinical trials in one indication may not be replicated in other indications.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, and we may face similar setbacks.\nWe do not know whether our ongoing or planned clinical trials of roxadustat or pamrevlumab will need to be redesigned based on interim results or if we will be able to achieve sufficient patient enrollment or complete planned clinical trials on schedule.\nClinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to address any physician or patient safety concerns that arise during the course of the trial;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain required regulatory or institutional review board approval or guidance;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach timely agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to recruit, enroll and retain patients through the completion of the trial;\n\u2022\npatient recruitment, enrollment, or retention, or clinical site initiation or retention problems associated with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and the resulting Coronavirus Disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic;\n\u2022\npatient recruitment, enrollment, or retention, clinical site initiation, or retention problems associated with civil unrest or military conflicts around the world, specifically the conflict in Ukraine which could affect our clinical trials enrolling in Ukraine (currently only ZEPHYRUS-2), or other sites or trials if the conflict spreads or has effects on countries outside of Ukraine;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to maintain clinical sites in compliance with clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to initiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; and\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nIn particular, identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the rate at which we can recruit and enroll patients in testing our product candidates. Patients may be unwilling to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsize and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for and design of the study in question;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nability to enroll patients in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly for IPF);\n\u2022\nongoing clinical trials of competitive agents;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of the potential advantages of our product candidates being studied in relation to available therapies or other products under development;\n\u2022\nour CRO\u2019s and our trial sites\u2019 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022\nability to monitor patients and collect patient data adequately during and after treatment.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate on-going or planned clinical trials.\nIn addition, we could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the relevant institutional review boards at the sites at which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. A suspension or termination of clinical trials may result from any number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, changes in laws or regulations, or a principal investigator\u2019s determination that a serious adverse event could be related to our product candidates. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase the costs of the trial, delay the product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence marketing and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business, operations, and prospects.\nOur product candidates may cause or have attributed to them undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates or that may be identified as related to our product candidates by physician investigators conducting our clinical trials or even competing products in development that utilize a similar mechanism of action or act through a similar biological disease pathway could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. If we determine that there is a likely causal relationship between a serious adverse event and our product candidate, and such safety event is material or significant enough, it may result in:\n\u2022\nour clinical trial development plan becoming longer and more expensive;\n\u2022\nterminating some of our clinical trials for the product candidates or specific indications affected;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities increasing the data and information required to approve our product candidates and imposing other requirements; and\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners terminating our existing agreements.\nThe occurrence of any or all of these events may cause the development of our product candidates to be delayed or terminated, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Refer to \u201cBusiness - Overview\u201d in this Annual Report for a discussion of the adverse events and serious adverse events that have emerged in clinical trials of roxadustat and pamrevlumab.\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not uncover all possible adverse effects that patients may experience.\nClinical trials are conducted in representative samples of the potential patient population, which may have significant variability. Clinical trials are by design based on a limited number of subjects and of limited duration for exposure to the product used to determine whether, on a potentially statistically significant basis, the planned safety and efficacy of any product candidate can be achieved. As with the results of any statistical sampling, we cannot be sure that all side effects of our product candidates may be uncovered, and it may be the case that only with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate for a longer duration, that a more complete safety profile is identified. Further, even larger clinical trials may not identify rare serious adverse effects or the duration of such studies may not be sufficient to identify when those events may occur. There have been other products, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents (\u201cESAs\u201d), for which safety concerns have been uncovered following approval by regulatory authorities. Such safety concerns have led to labeling changes or withdrawal of ESAs products from the market. While our most advanced product candidate is chemically unique from ESAs, it or any of our product candidates may be subject to known or unknown risks. Patients treated with our products, if approved, may experience adverse reactions and it is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may ask for additional safety data as a condition of, or in connection with, our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates. If safety problems occur or are identified after our product candidates reach the market, we may, or regulatory authorities may require us to amend the labeling of our products, recall our products or even withdraw approval for our products.\nIf our manufacturers or we cannot properly manufacture the appropriate volume of product, we may experience delays in development, regulatory approval, launch or successful commercialization.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our products require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture and manage our product candidates at sufficient yields, quality and at commercial scale. Although we have entered into commercial supply agreements for roxadustat and pamrevlumab, we will need to enter into additional commercial supply agreements, including for backup or second source third-party manufacturers. We may not be able to enter into these agreements with satisfactory terms or on a timely manner. In addition, we may experience delays or technical problems associated with technology transfer of manufacturing processes to any new suppliers.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing or managing third parties in manufacturing any of our product candidates in the volumes that are expected to be necessary to support large-scale clinical trials and sales. In addition, we have limited experience forecasting supply requirements or coordinating supply chain (including export management) for launch or commercialization, which is a complex process involving our third-party manufacturers and logistics providers, and for roxadustat, our collaboration partners. We may not be able to accurately forecast supplies for commercial launch or do so in a timely manner and our efforts to establish these manufacturing and supply chain management capabilities may not meet our requirements as to quantities, scale-up, yield, cost, potency or quality in compliance with cGMP, particularly if the marketing authorization or market uptake is more rapid than anticipated or we have an unanticipated surge in demand.\nWe have a limited amount of roxadustat and pamrevlumab in storage, limited capacity reserved at our third-party manufacturers, and, even if we have or are able to put sufficient supply agreements in place for our development and commercialization plan, there are long lead times required to manufacture and scale-up the manufacture of additional supply, as required for both late-stage clinical trials, post-approval trials, and commercial supply. In addition, if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of roxadustat in the U.S. in CKD anemia, we may have excess supply manufactured in anticipation of commercialization. Such roxadustat excess supply could be wasted, for example, if it expires prior to being used in other clinical trials or prior to being used in other territories where such roxadustat formulation is approved. If we are unable to forecast, order or manufacture sufficient quantities of roxadustat or pamrevlumab on a timely basis, it may delay our development, launch or commercialization in some or all indications we are currently pursuing. Insufficient supply could be a particular risk if we were to obtain regulatory approval of pamrevlumab in all indications being studied (IPF, LAPC, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and DMD). Any delay or interruption in the supply of our product candidates or products could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur commercial drug product and the product we use for clinical trials must be produced under applicable cGMP regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations by us or our third-party manufacturers may require us to recall commercial product or repeat clinical trials, which would impact sales revenue and/or delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe may add or change manufacturers for our products. We, our partners, or regulatory authorities may also request or make changes to our manufacturing processes or to our product or packaging specifications, including in order to accommodate changes in regulations, manufacturing equipment or to account for different processes at new or second source suppliers. If any such changes are made with respect to roxadustat or pamrevlumab we may need to demonstrate comparability to the products and processes already approved or in approval by various regulatory authorities, including potentially through the conduct of additional clinical trials. Even if we do demonstrate comparability, a regulatory agency could challenge that result which could delay our development or commercialization progress. Any such changes could also lead to product having an earlier expiration date, shorter shelf life, or failing to meet specifications. Any of these occurrences may materially impact our operations and potential profitability.\nWe, and even an experienced third-party manufacturer, may encounter difficulties in production. Difficulties may include:\n\u2022\ncosts and challenges associated with scale-up and attaining sufficient manufacturing yields, in particular for biologic products such as pamrevlumab, which is a monoclonal antibody;\n\u2022\ncontracting with additional suppliers and validation/qualification of additional facilities to meet growing demand;\n\u2022\nsupply chain issues, including coordination of multiple contractors in our supply chain and securing necessary licenses (such as export licenses);\n\u2022\nthe timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and supplies, including delays in availability due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nlimited stability and product shelf life;\n\u2022\nequipment maintenance issues or failure;\n\u2022\nquality control and quality assurance issues;\n\u2022\nshortages of qualified personnel and capital required to manufacture large quantities of product;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements that vary in each country where a product might be sold;\n\u2022\ncapacity or forecasting limitations and scheduling availability in contracted facilities;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, floods, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts, or accidents such as fire, that affect facilities, possibly limit or postpone production, and increase costs; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain license to proprietary starting materials.\nRegulatory authorities will do their own benefit risk analysis and may reach a different conclusion than we or our partners have, and these regulatory authorities may base their approval decision on different analyses, data, and statistical methods than ours.\nEven if we believe we have achieved positive clinical results, such as superiority or non-inferiority, in certain endpoints, populations or sub-populations, or using certain statistical methods of analysis, the FDA and European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) will each conduct their own benefit-risk analysis and may reach different conclusions, using different statistical methods, different endpoints or definitions thereof, or different patient populations or sub-populations. Furthermore, while we may seek regulatory advice or agreement in key commercial markets prior to and after application for marketing authorization, regulatory authorities may change their approvability criteria based on the data, their internal analyses and external factors, including discussions with expert advisors. For example, while we have received approval of our marketing authorization applications for roxadustat in the European Union, Great Britain, China, Japan, South Korea, and Chile for CKD anemia for patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, we received a CRL in the U.S. from the FDA. Regulatory authorities may approve one of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials. While we have and will present to regulatory authorities certain pre-specified and post hoc (not pre-specified) sub-populations, sub-group, and sensitivity analyses (for example, incident dialysis), multiple secondary endpoints, and multiple sets of stratification factors and analytical methods (such as long-term follow up analyses), including adjusted and censored data, regulatory authorities may reject these analyses, methods, or even parts of our trial design or certain data from our studies, the rationale for our pre-specified non-inferiority margins or other portions of our statistical analysis plans. In addition, even if we are able to provide positive data with respect to certain analyses, regulatory authorities may not include such claims on any approved labeling. The failure to obtain regulatory approval, or any label, population or other approval limitations in any jurisdiction, may significantly limit or delay our ability to generate revenues, and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenue.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, the label we obtain may limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed.\nWith respect to roxadustat, regulatory approvals obtained, could limit the approved indicated uses for which roxadustat may be marketed. For example, our label approved in Japan, includes the following warning: \u201cSerious thromboembolism such as cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism may occur, possibly resulting in death, during treatment with roxadustat.\u201d Additionally, in the U.S., ESAs have been subject to significant safety warnings, including the boxed warnings on their labels. The safety concerns relating to ESAs may result in labeling for roxadustat containing similar warnings. Any label for roxadustat may contain other warnings or limit the market opportunity or approved indications for roxadustat. These warnings could include warnings against exceeding specified hemoglobin targets and other warnings that derive from the safety issues associated with ESAs, even if our Phase 3 clinical trials do not themselves raise safety concerns.\nWe face substantial competition in the discovery, development and commercialization of product candidates.\nThe development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Our future success depends on our ability and/or the ability of our collaboration partners to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our objective is to discover, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety. We expect that in many cases, the products that we commercialize will compete with existing, market-leading products of companies that have large, established commercial organizations.\nWhere roxadustat is approved and launched commercially, competing drugs are expected to include ESAs, particularly in those patient segments where ESAs are used. Currently available ESAs include epoetin alfa (EPOGEN\u00ae, marketed by Amgen Inc. in the U.S., Procrit\u00ae and Erypo\u00ae/Eprex\u00ae, marketed by Johnson & Johnson Inc., and Espo\u00ae marketed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in Japan and China), darbepoetin (Amgen/Kyowa Hakko Kirin\u2019s Aranesp\u00ae and NESP\u00ae) and Mircera\u00ae marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche (\u201cRoche\u201d) outside of the U.S. and by Vifor Pharma, a Roche licensee, in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as biosimilar versions of these currently marketed ESA products. ESAs have been used in the treatment of anemia in CKD for more than 30 years, serving a significant majority of dialysis CKD patients. While non-dialysis CKD patients who are not under the care of nephrologists, including those with diabetes and hypertension, do not typically receive ESAs and are often left untreated, some non-dialysis patients under nephrology or hematology care may be receiving ESA therapy. It may be difficult to encourage healthcare providers and patients to switch to roxadustat from products with which they have become familiar.\nWe may also face competition from potential new anemia therapies currently on the market or in clinical development, including in those patient segments not adequately addressed by ESAs. Companies that are currently developing hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (\u201cHIF-PH\u201d) inhibitors for anemia in CKD indications include: GlaxoSmithKline plc (\u201cGSK\u201d), Bayer Corporation (\u201cBayer\u201d), Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cAkebia\u201d), Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Akebia\u2019s partner in the U.S. and Europe, Japan Tobacco, and Zydus Cadila (India) (\u201cZydus\u201d). In March 2021, Akebia submitted an NDA to the FDA for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of March 29, 2022. In October 2021, Otsuka Pharmaceutical submitted an initial marketing authorization application to the EMA for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD in adults.\nIn July 2021, GSK announced positive topline results from five Phase 3 studies of daprodustat for non-dialysis and dialysis patients with anemia due to CKD. GSK has stated that they expect to file an NDA in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application in the European Union in the first half of 2022.\nIn Japan, roxadustat faces the following competitive drugs being sold by the following companies for the treatment of anemia of CKD patients on and not on dialysis: vadadustat by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Corporation, Akebia\u2019s collaboration partner, daprodustat by GSK and its partner Kyowa Hakko Kirin, molidustat by Bayer, and enarodustat by Japan Tobacco (to be sold by Torii Pharmaceuticals Ltd).\nIn July 2020, Zydus received approval from the FDA to begin a Phase 1 study of desidustat for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia, which could potentially be competitive with roxadustat within this indication.\nReblozyl\u00ae (luspatercept) was approved by the FDA in April 2020 for the treatment of anemia in adults with MDS with ring sideroblasts or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis who need regular red blood cell transfusions and have not responded well to or cannot receive an ESA. It is the first and only erythroid maturation agent approved in the U.S., Europe, and Canada and is part of a global collaboration between Acceleron Pharma, Inc. and Bristol Myers Squibb.\nIn addition, we will likely face competition from other companies developing biologic therapies for the treatment of other anemia indications that we may also seek to pursue in the future. We may face competition for patient recruitment, enrollment for clinical trials, and potentially in commercial sales. There may also be new therapies for renal-related diseases that could limit the market or level of reimbursement available for roxadustat.\nIn China, ESA is considered the standard of care for treatment of anemia of CKD, and locally manufactured epoetin alfa is offered by 15 local manufacturers including the market leader EPIAO that is marketed by 3SBio Inc. We may face potential competition from other HIF-PH inhibitors. Companies active in the US such as Akebia, Bayer, and GSK have been authorized by the National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d) to conduct trials in China to support its ex-China regulatory filings. A number of domestic companies, including Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., Guandong Sunshine Health Investment Co., Ltd., 3SBio Inc., and Hangzhou Andao Pharmaceutical Co. have been permitted by the NMPA to conduct clinical trials in their locally developed HIF-PH inhibitor investigational compounds for the treatment of anemia in CKD. Domestic companies are also in-licensing global compounds to be developed as domestic drugs, including China Medical System which in-licensed desidustat, a compound that is currently in Phase 3 trials in India, from Zydus for greater China in January 2020. In January 2021, China Medical System Holdings Ltd. was granted approval by the Chinese NMPA to begin trials for desidustat in patients with anemia of CKD, including dialysis and non-dialysis patients. Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a domestic company in China, has in-licensed enarodustat from Japan Tobacco and received NMPA approval in the third quarter of 2020 to initiate Phase 3 studies. We will also face competition from generics who could enter the market after expiry of our patents in China, and two potential market players have already started bioequivalence studies, including Chia Tai-Tiangqing Pharmaceutical Holdings and CSPA Pharmaceutical Group.\nThe first biosimilar ESA, Pfizer\u2019s Retacrit\u00ae (epoetin zeta), entered the U.S. market in November 2018. Market penetration of Retacrit and the potential addition of other biosimilar ESAs currently under development may alter the competitive and pricing landscape of anemia therapy in CKD patients on dialysis under the end-stage renal disease bundle. The patents for Amgen\u2019s EPOGEN\u00ae (epoetin alfa) expired in 2004 in Europe, and the final material patents in the U.S. expired in May 2015. Several biosimilar versions of currently marketed ESAs are available for sale in Europe, China and other territories. In the U.S., a few ESA biosimilars are currently under development. Sandoz, a division of Novartis, markets Binocrit\u00ae (epoetin alfa) in Europe and may file a biosimilar Biologics License Application in the U.S.\nThe majority of the current CKD anemia market focuses on dialysis patients, who visit dialysis centers on a regular basis, typically three times a week, and anemia therapies are administered as part of the visit. Two of the largest operators of dialysis clinics in the U.S., DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc. (\u201cDaVita\u201d), and Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (\u201cFresenius\u201d), collectively provide dialysis care to more than 80% of U.S. dialysis patients, and therefore have historically executed long-term contracts including rebate terms with Amgen. Successful penetration in this market will likely require our partner AstraZeneca to enter into a definitive agreement with Fresenius, DaVita, or other dialysis organizations, on favorable pricing terms and on a timely basis.\nIf approved and launched commercially to treat IPF, pamrevlumab is expected to compete with Roche\u2019s Esbriet\u00ae (pirfenidone), and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG\u2019s Ofev\u00ae (nintedanib). We believe that if pamrevlumab can be shown to safely stabilize or reverse lung fibrosis, and thus stabilize or improve lung function in IPF patients, it can compete with pirfenidone and nintedanib for market share in IPF. However, it may be difficult to encourage treatment providers and patients to switch to pamrevlumab from an oral product with which they are already familiar to a product delivered via in-office infusion. Furthermore, pirfenidone and nintedanib may be produced as generics in the near future. We may also face competition from potential new IPF therapies in recruitment and enrollment in our clinical trials and potentially in commercialization.\nPamrevlumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be more expensive and less convenient than oral small molecules such as nintedanib and pirfenidone. Other potential competitive product candidates in various stages of development for IPF include Kadmon Holdings, Inc.\u2019s KD025, Galecto\u2019s GB0139, Liminal BioSciences\u2019 PBI-4050, and Roche/Promedior, Inc.\u2019s PRM-151. Roche is enrolling patients in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of PRM-151, a recombinant human pentraxin-2 (rhPTX-2), compared to placebo in patients with IPF. United Therapeutics Corporation is enrolling patients in its Phase 3 trial of treprostinil in IPF.\nIf pamrevlumab is approved and launched commercially to treat LAPC or metastatic pancreatic cancer, pamrevlumab may face competition from products currently used for pancreatic cancer. These include FOLFIRINOX, a combination chemotherapy regimen of folic acid, 5-fluouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and agents seeking approval in combination with gemcitibine and nab-paclitaxel from companies such as Rafael Pharma\u2019s defactinib/CPI-613 and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019s istiratumab. Gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel are the current standard of care in the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\nIf approved and launched commercially to treat DMD, pamrevlumab is expected to face competition from drugs that have been approved in major markets such as the U.S., European Union, and Japan. On September 19, 2016, the FDA approved Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSarepta\u201d) Exondys 51TM (eteplirsen). Exondys 51 is approved to treat patients who have a mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping, representing approximately 13% of patients with DMD. In Europe, Sarepta received a negative opinion for its marketing application for eteplirsen from the EMA in September 2018. Sarepta\u2019s Vyondys 53TM (golodirsen) was approved by the FDA in December 2019 for patients with a confirmed genetic mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping, which accounts for approximately 8% of the DMD population. Sarepta\u2019s Amondys 45\u2122 (casimersen) was approved by the FDA in February 2021 for patients with a confirmed genetic mutation that is amenable to exon 45 skipping, which accounts for approximately 8% of the DMD population.\nPTC Therapeutics\u2019 product TranslarnaTM received a conditional approval in Europe in 2014, which was renewed in November 2016 with a request for a new randomized placebo-controlled 18-month study by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA; however, the FDA informed the sponsor in a CRL in October 2017, as well as in its response to PTC Therapeutics\u2019 appeal, that the FDA is unable to approve the application in its current form. An additional Phase 3 study is currently ongoing. While Translarna TM targets a different set of DMD patients from those targeted by Sarepta\u2019s Exondys 51\u00ae, it is also limited to a subset of patients who carry a specific mutation. Conversely, pamrevlumab is intended to treat DMD patients without limitation to type of mutation.\nPamrevlumab may also face competition from other drugs currently in clinical development in patient recruiting and enrollment in clinical trials, and, if approved, in commercialization. Examples of those compounds currently under clinical development are the drug candidates from Pfizer, Pliant, Galecto, and Sarepta. Pfizer initiated a Phase 3 study with PF-06939926, its AAV9 mini-dystrophin gene therapy for DMD in February 2020.\nThe success of any or all of these potential competitive products may negatively impact the development and potential for success of pamrevlumab. In addition, any competitive products that are on the market or in development may compete with pamrevlumab for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials or may force us to change our clinical trial design, including, in order to compare pamrevlumab against another drug, which may be the new standard of care.\nMoreover, many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients, manufacturing pharmaceutical products, and commercialization. In the potential anemia market for roxadustat, for example, large and established companies such as Amgen and Roche, among others, compete aggressively to maintain their market shares. In particular, the currently marketed ESA products are supported by large pharmaceutical companies that have greater experience and expertise in commercialization in the anemia market, including in securing reimbursement, government contracts and relationships with key opinion leaders; conducting testing and clinical trials; obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and distribution relationships to market products; and marketing approved products. These companies also have significantly greater scale, research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in later stages of development and have collaboration agreements in our target markets with leading dialysis companies and research institutions. If our collaboration partners and we are not able to compete effectively against existing and potential competitors, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and others in the medical community. Demonstrating safety and efficacy of our product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals will not guarantee future revenue. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe safety profile and perceptions of safety of our product candidates relative to competitive products;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment by healthcare providers and patients;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of the product candidate over alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion or exclusion of the product candidate from treatment guidelines established by various physician groups and the viewpoints of influential physicians with respect to the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe cost of the product candidate relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nadequate pricing and reimbursement by third parties and government authorities as described below;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIn addition, see the risk factor titled \u201cOur product candidates may cause or have attributed to them undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit their commercial potential\u201d above. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by such parties, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable.\nNo or limited reimbursement or insurance coverage of our approved products, if any, by third-party payors may render our products less attractive to patients and healthcare providers.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any approved products will depend significantly on reimbursement or coverage of our products by government or third-party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures or prices of related products for which the government or third-party reimbursement applies. Coverage and reimbursement by the government or a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under applicable health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor, which we may not be able to provide. Furthermore, the reimbursement policies of governments and third-party payors may significantly change in a manner that renders our clinical data insufficient for adequate reimbursement or otherwise limits the successful marketing of our products. Even if we obtain coverage for our product candidates, the pricing may be subject to re-negotiations or third-party payors may not establish adequate reimbursement amounts, which may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. For example, our current National Reimbursement Drug List reimbursement pricing for China is effective for a standard two-year period (between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023), after which time we will have to renegotiate a new price for roxadustat.\nReference pricing is used by various Europe member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, our partner or we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available products in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unacceptable levels, our partner or we may elect not to commercialize our products in such countries, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf our collaborations were terminated or if Astellas or AstraZeneca were to prioritize other initiatives over their collaborations with us, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates would suffer.\nWe have entered into collaboration agreements with respect to the development and commercialization of our lead product candidate, roxadustat, with Astellas and AstraZeneca. These agreements provide for reimbursement of our development costs by our collaboration partners and also provide for commercialization of roxadustat throughout the major territories of the world.\nOur agreements with Astellas and AstraZeneca provide each of them with the right to terminate their respective agreements with us, upon the occurrence of negative clinical results, delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates or adverse regulatory requirements or guidance. In addition, each of those agreements provides our respective partners the right to terminate any of those agreements upon written notice for convenience. The termination of any of our collaboration agreements would require us to fund and perform the further development and commercialization of roxadustat in the affected territory, or pursue another collaboration, which we may be unable to do, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Moreover, if Astellas or AstraZeneca, or any successor entity, were to determine that their collaborations with us are no longer a strategic priority, or if either of them or a successor were to reduce their level of commitment to their collaborations with us, our ability to develop and commercialize roxadustat could suffer. As a result of the CRL we received for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients in the U.S., we are currently in discussions with AstraZeneca to determine a potential path forward for the development of roxadustat in the U.S., and there is an increased possibility that our Collaboration Agreement with AstraZeneca could be amended or terminated. We and our partner, AstraZeneca, met with the FDA and discussed the design of an additional trial in CKD anemia. We continue to discuss the possible development options in the U.S. with AstraZeneca and the FDA. In addition, our collaborations are exclusive and preclude us from entering into additional collaboration agreements with other parties in the area or field of exclusivity.\nIf we do not establish and maintain strategic collaborations related to our product candidates, we will bear all of the risk and costs related to the development and commercialization of any such product candidate, and we may need to seek additional financing, hire additional employees and otherwise develop expertise at significant cost. This in turn may negatively affect the development of our other product candidates as we direct resources to our most advanced product candidates.\nOur collaboration partners also have certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidates with respect to which they are providing funding. If we have a disagreement over strategy and activities with our collaboration partners, our plans for obtaining regulatory approval may be revised and negatively affect the anticipated timing and potential for success of our product candidates. Even if a product under a collaboration agreement receives regulatory approval, we will remain substantially dependent on the commercialization strategy and efforts of our collaboration partners, and our collaboration partners have limited or no experience in commercialization of an anemia drug. If our collaboration partners are unsuccessful in their commercialization efforts, our results will be negatively affected.\nWith respect to our collaboration agreements for roxadustat, there are additional complexities in that our collaboration partners, Astellas and AstraZeneca, and we must reach consensus on certain portions of our development programs and regulatory activities. In addition, there are aspects of commercial operations that require cooperation among the collaboration partners, including safety data reporting. Multi-party decision-making is complex and involves significant time and effort, and there can be no assurance that the parties will cooperate or reach consensus, or that one or both of our partners will not ask to proceed independently in some or all of their respective territories or functional areas of responsibility in which the applicable collaboration partner would otherwise be obligated to cooperate with us. Any disputes or lack of cooperation with us by either Astellas or AstraZeneca, or both, may negatively impact the timing or success of our regulatory approval applications.\nWe may conduct proprietary research programs in specific disease areas that are not covered by our collaboration agreements. Our pursuit of such opportunities could, however, result in conflicts with our collaboration partners in the event that any of our collaboration partners takes the position that our internal activities overlap with those areas that are exclusive to our collaboration agreements. Moreover, disagreements with our collaboration partners could develop over rights to our intellectual property, including the enforcement of those rights. In addition, our collaboration agreements may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Any conflict with our collaboration partners could lead to the termination of our collaboration agreements, delay collaborative activities, reduce our ability to renew agreements or obtain future collaboration agreements or result in litigation or arbitration and would negatively impact our relationship with existing collaboration partners, and could impact our commercial results.\nCertain of our collaboration partners could also become our competitors in the future. If our collaboration partners develop competing products, fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, the development and commercialization of our product candidates and products could be delayed.\nIf our preclinical and clinical trial contractors do not properly perform their agreed upon obligations, we may not be able to obtain or may be delayed in receiving regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe rely heavily on university, hospital, dialysis centers and other institutions and third parties, including the principal investigators and their staff, to carry out our clinical trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and designs. We also rely on a number of third-party CROs to assist in undertaking, managing, monitoring and executing our ongoing clinical trials, including those for roxadustat. We expect to continue to rely on CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct our development efforts in the future, including our continued development of roxadustat. We compete with many other companies for the resources of these third parties, and large pharmaceutical companies often have significantly more extensive agreements and relationships with such third-party providers, and such third-party providers may prioritize the requirements of such large pharmaceutical companies over ours. The third parties on whom we rely may terminate their engagements with us at any time, which may cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If any such third party terminates its engagement with us or fails to perform as agreed, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements, which would result in significant cost and delay to our product development program. Moreover, our agreements with such third parties generally do not provide assurances regarding employee turnover and availability, which may cause interruptions in the research on our product candidates by such third parties.\nMoreover, while our reliance on these third parties for certain development and management activities will reduce our control over these activities, it will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with regulations and standards, including GCP requirements for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results from trials are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we, as the sponsor, remain responsible for ensuring that each of these clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol under legal and regulatory requirements, including GCP. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites.\nIf any of our CROs, trial sites, principal investigators or other third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, other regulations, trial protocol or other requirements under their agreements with us, the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain may be compromised or unreliable, and the trials of our product candidates may not meet regulatory requirements. If trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, the development of our product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated, regulatory authorities may require us to exclude the use of patient data from our approval applications or perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Regulatory authorities may even reject our application for approval or refuse to accept our future applications for an extended period of time. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements or that our results may be used in support of our regulatory submissions. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct many aspects of our product manufacturing and distribution, and these third parties may terminate these agreements or not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have operating manufacturing facilities at this time other than our roxadustat manufacturing facilities in China, and our current commercial manufacturing plants in China are not expected to satisfy the requirements necessary to support development and commercialization outside of China. Other than in and for China specifically, we do not expect to independently manufacture our products. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to scale-up, manufacture and supply roxadustat and our other product candidates outside of China. We rely on third parties for distribution, including our collaboration partners and their vendors, except in China where we have established a jointly owned entity with AstraZeneca to manage most of the distribution in China. Risks arising from our reliance on third-party manufacturers include:\n\u2022\nreduced control and additional burdens of oversight as a result of using third-party manufacturers and distributors for all aspects of manufacturing activities, including regulatory compliance and quality control and quality assurance;\n\u2022\ntermination of manufacturing agreements, termination fees associated with such termination, or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties may negatively impact our planned development and commercialization activities;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary technology, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers, distributors or suppliers unrelated to our product, including the merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy of a manufacturer or supplier or a catastrophic event, including disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting our manufacturers, distributors or suppliers.\nAny of these events could lead to development delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval or affect our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Some of these events could be the basis for action by the FDA or another regulatory authority, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must pass inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Although, except for China, we do not control the manufacturing operations of, and expect to remain completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for manufacture of drug substance and finished drug product, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our product candidates are manufactured in compliance with cGMP requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our or our collaboration partners\u2019 specifications, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates and our development or commercialization plans may be delayed. In addition, we have limited control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. In addition, although our longer-term agreements are expected to provide for requirements to meet our quantity and quality requirements to manufacture our products candidates for clinical studies and commercial sale, we will have minimal direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel and we expect to rely on our audit rights to ensure that those qualifications are maintained to meet our requirements. If our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities do not pass inspection by regulatory authorities, or if regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products, or withdraw any such approval in the future, we would need to identify and qualify alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products, if approved. Moreover, any failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or adverse regulatory consequences, including clinical holds, warnings or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would be expected to significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products to us and our collaboration partners.\nWe have a letter agreement with IRIX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cIRIX\u201d), a third-party manufacturer that we have used in the past, pursuant to which we agreed to negotiate a single source manufacturing agreement that included a right of first negotiation for the cGMP manufacture of HIF-PH inhibitors, including roxadustat, provided that IRIX is able to match any third-party bids within 5%. The exclusive right to manufacture extends for five years after approval of an NDA for those compounds, and any agreement would provide that no minimum amounts would be specified until appropriate by forecast and that we and a commercialization partner would have the rights to contract with independent third parties that exceed IRIX\u2019s internal manufacturing capabilities or in the event that we or our commercialization partner determines for reasons of continuity of supply and security that such a need exists, provided that IRIX would supply no less than 65% of the product if it is able to provide this level of supply. Subsequent to the letter agreement, IRIX and we have entered into several additional service agreements. IRIX has requested in writing that we honor the letter agreement with respect to the single source manufacturing agreement, and if we were to enter into any such exclusive manufacturing agreement, there can be no assurance that IRIX will not assert a claim for right to manufacture roxadustat or that IRIX could manufacture roxadustat successfully and in accordance with applicable regulations for a commercial product and the specifications of our collaboration partners. In 2015, Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., a business unit of DPx Holdings B.V., acquired IRIX, and in 2017, ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. acquired Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nIf any third-party manufacturer terminates its engagement with us or fails to perform as agreed, we may be required to find replacement manufacturers, which would result in significant cost and delay to our development programs. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our product candidates, we may incur significant delays and added costs in identifying, qualifying and contracting with any such third party or potential second source manufacturer. In any event, with any third-party manufacturer we expect to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know-how with the third-party manufacturer, which can be time-consuming and may result in delays. These delays could result in a suspension or delay of marketing roxadustat.\nWe may experience delays or technical problems associated with technology transfer, scale-up, or validation of our biologics manufacturing.\nWe have entered into an initial commercial supply agreement for the manufacture of pamrevlumab with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. (\u201cSamsung\u201d) and are transitioning our manufacturing of pamrevlumab from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG to Samsung. However, we may experience delays or technical problems associated with:\n\u2022\ntechnology transfer of the manufacturing process to Samsung;\n\u2022\nscale-up and production of cGMP batches;\n\u2022\nanalytical method validation and transfer to Samsung;\n\u2022\nprocess validation, including process characterization and process performance qualification batches; and\n\u2022\nset up and execution of appropriate stability studies.\nWe have made certain manufacturing commitments to Samsung, and there is a contractual risk we will not require the quantities of pamrevlumab we have committed to, particularly if we cease some of our pamrevlumab clinical trials. In addition, our product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access and prioritization to manufacture. Certain third-party manufacturers may be contractually prohibited from manufacturing our product due to non-compete agreements with our competitors or a commitment to grant another party priority relative to our products. There are a limited number of third-party manufacturers that operate under cGMP and that might be capable of manufacturing to meet our requirements. Due to the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the contractual freedom, expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our products on a commercial scale, identifying and qualifying a replacement third-party manufacturer would be expensive and time-consuming and may cause delay or interruptions in the production of our product candidates or products, which in turn may delay, prevent or impair our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe also carry the risk that if all three indications are successful, the commercial demand may exceed planned production supply at Samsung. In this event, it may be necessary to find third party manufacturers who have the capacity and capability to produce the required quantities of pamrevlumab. This may be subject to availability of such manufacturers since there are only a limited number of suppliers who have the larger scale bioreactors that are needed for commercial pamrevlumab supply. If we need to find a supplier in China, there may be additional delays in importing custom raw materials and supplements into China.\nCertain components of our products are acquired from single-source suppliers or without long-term supply agreements. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not have an alternative supplier of certain components of our product candidates. We may be unable to enter into long-term commercial supply arrangements for some of our products, or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business. In addition, we currently rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers some of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates. We do not have direct control over the acquisition of those materials by our contract manufacturers.\nThe logistics of our supply chain, which include shipment of materials and intermediates from countries such as China and India add additional time and risk (including risk of loss) to the manufacture of our product candidates. While we have in the past maintained sufficient inventory of materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d), and drug product to meet our and our collaboration partners\u2019 needs to date, the lead-time and regulatory approvals required to source from and into countries outside of the U.S. increase the risk of delay and potential shortages of supply.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and contractual arrangements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. We will only be able to protect our products and proprietary information and technology to the extent that our patents, trade secrets, contractual position, and governmental regulations and laws allow us to do so. Any unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information or technology could compromise our competitive position. Moreover, we are, have been, and may in the future be involved in legal proceedings involving our intellectual property and initiated by third parties, which proceedings can be associated with significant costs and commitment of management time and attention.\nWe have in the past been involved in, and may in the future be involved in initiating legal or administrative proceedings involving the product candidates and intellectual property of our competitors. These proceedings can result in significant costs and commitment of management time and attention, and there can be no assurance that our efforts would be successful in preventing or limiting the ability of our competitors to market competing products.\nComposition-of-matter patents are generally considered the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such, patents provide protection not limited to any one method of use. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method(s), and do not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. We rely on a combination of these and other types of patents to protect our product candidates, and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will create and sustain the competitive position of our product candidates.\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical product patents involve highly complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Any patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents. Even if patents do successfully issue from our applications, third parties may challenge their validity or enforceability, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Even if our patents and patent applications are not challenged by third parties, those patents and patent applications may not prevent others from designing around our claims and may not otherwise adequately protect our product candidates. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, competitors with significantly greater resources could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Discoveries are generally published in the scientific literature well after their actual development, and patent applications in the U.S. and other countries are typically not published until 18 months after their filing, and in some cases are never published. Therefore, we cannot be certain that our licensors or we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or patent applications, or that our licensors or we were the first to file for patent protection covering such inventions. Subject to meeting other requirements for patentability, for U.S. patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to receive patent protection for that invention while, outside the U.S., the first to file a patent application encompassing the invention is entitled to patent protection for the invention. The U.S. moved to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, effective March 16, 2013. This system also includes procedures for challenging issued patents and pending patent applications, which creates additional uncertainty. We have, are, and may again become involved in opposition or interference proceedings challenging our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of others, and the outcome of any such proceedings are highly uncertain. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could reduce the scope of or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology and compete directly with us, or result in our inability to manufacture, develop or commercialize our product candidates without infringing the patent rights of others.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by our patents. Although our agreements require all of our employees to acknowledge ownership by us of inventions conceived as a result of employment from the point of conception and, to the extent necessary, perfect such ownership by assignment, and we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information and technology to enter into appropriate confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information and technology will not be subject to unauthorized disclosure, use, or misappropriation or that our competitors will not otherwise gain access to or independently develop substantially equivalent trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other information and technology. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries, in particular, China, where we have operations, do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property globally. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property related to our product candidates and technology to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nIntellectual property disputes may be costly, time consuming, and may negatively affect our competitive position.\nOur commercial success may depend on our avoiding infringement of the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties as well as on enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights against third parties. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology intellectual property disputes are characterized by complex, lengthy and expensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights. We have initiated and may again initiate or become party to or be threatened with future litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and competing products.\nAs our product candidates progress toward commercialization, our collaboration partners or we may be subject to patent infringement claims from third parties. We attempt to ensure that our product candidates do not infringe third-party patents and other proprietary rights. However, the patent landscape in competitive product areas is highly complex, and there may be patents of third parties of which we are unaware that may result in claims of infringement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe proprietary rights of third parties, and parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could potentially block further efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates including roxadustat or pamrevlumab. Any litigation involving defense against claims of infringement, regardless of the merit of such claims, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management time.\nWe may consider administrative proceedings and other means for challenging third-party patents and patent applications. An unfavorable outcome in any such challenge could require us to cease using the related technology and to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing third party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, in which case our business could be harmed.\nWe intend, if necessary, to vigorously enforce our intellectual property in order to protect the proprietary position of our product candidates, including roxadustat and pamrevlumab. In addition, our collaboration partners who have been granted licenses to our patents may also have rights related to enforcement of those patents. Active efforts to enforce our patents by us or by our partners may include litigation, administrative proceedings, or both, depending on the potential benefits that might be available from those actions and the costs associated with undertaking those efforts against third parties. We carefully review and monitor publicly available information regarding products that may be competitive with our product candidates and assert our intellectual property rights where appropriate.\nThird parties have challenged and may again challenge our patents and patent applications. For example, various challenges against our HIF anemia-related technologies patent portfolio are ongoing in several territories including the U.S., Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Regardless of final outcome, the potential narrowing or revocation of any of the HIF anemia-related technology patents does not affect our exclusivity for roxadustat or our freedom-to-operate with respect to use of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in these or other territories.\nOppositions were filed against our European Patent No. 2872488 (the \u201c`488 Patent\u201d), which claims a crystalline form of roxadustat, and against our European Patent No. 3003284 (the \u201c`284 Patent\u201d), which claims photostable formulations of roxadustat. In its Written Decision of November 2021, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office found that the claims of the \u2018488 patent did not meet the grounds for novelty. FibroGen has appealed this decision. Final resolution of the opposition proceedings will take time, and we cannot be assured that the `488 Patent or `284 Patents will ultimately survive such proceedings as originally granted or at all.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that any public announcements concerning the status or outcomes of intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings may adversely affect the price of our stock. If securities analysts or our investors interpret such status or outcomes as negative or otherwise creating uncertainty, our common stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on third parties and agreements with collaboration partners requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor may discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nOur reliance on third-party contractors to develop and manufacture our product candidates is based upon agreements that limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets and know-how. Despite the contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and information are disclosed or used, even if unintentionally, in violation of these agreements. In the highly competitive markets in which our product candidates are expected to compete, protecting our trade secrets, including our strategies for addressing competing products, is imperative, and any unauthorized use or disclosure could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn addition, our collaboration partners are larger, more complex organizations than ours, and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of our proprietary information may be increased despite their internal procedures and contractual obligations that we have in place with them. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, a competitor\u2019s discovery of such trade secrets and information could impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe cost of maintaining our patent protection is high and requires continuous review and diligence. We may not be able to effectively maintain our intellectual property position throughout the major markets of the world.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent authorities require maintenance fees and payments as well as continued compliance with a number of procedural and documentary requirements. Noncompliance may result in abandonment or lapse of the subject patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance may result in reduced royalty payments for lack of patent coverage in a particular jurisdiction from our collaboration partners or may result in competition, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, certain strategic decisions in balancing costs and the potential protection afforded by the patent laws of certain countries. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries throughout the world, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other countries. Third parties may use our technologies in territories in which we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may infringe our patents in territories which provide inadequate enforcement mechanisms, even if we have patent protection. Such third-party products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant problems in securing and defending our intellectual property rights outside the U.S.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain countries. The legal systems of certain countries do not always favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our patents, misappropriation of our trade secrets, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. In China, our intended establishment of significant operations will depend in substantial part on our ability to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights in that country. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign countries could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could put our patents in these territories at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, or our patent applications at risk of not being granted, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in all legal or other proceedings that we may initiate and, if we were to prevail, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our current or future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022\nWe or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022\nWe or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022\nThe prosecution of our pending patent applications may not result in granted patents.\n\u2022\nGranted patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022\nPatent protection on our product candidates may expire before we are able to develop and commercialize the product, or before we are able to recover our investment in the product.\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for such activities, as well as in countries in which we do not have patent rights, and may then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in markets where we intend to market our product candidates.\nThe existence of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in pharmaceutical markets may compromise our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.\nCounterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceutical products, are a significant problem, particularly in China. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are products sold or used for research under the same or similar names, or similar mechanism of action or product class, but which are sold without proper licenses or approvals, and are often lower cost, lower quality, different potency, or have different ingredients or formulations, and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. Such products may be used for indications or purposes that are not recommended or approved or for which there is no data or inadequate data with regard to safety or efficacy. Such products divert sales from genuine products. If counterfeit pharmaceuticals illegally sold or used for research result in adverse events or side effects to consumers, we may be associated with any negative publicity resulting from such incidents. Consumers may buy counterfeit pharmaceuticals that are in direct competition with our pharmaceuticals, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, business and results of operations. In addition, the use of counterfeit products could be used in non-clinical or clinical studies, or could otherwise produce undesirable side effects or adverse events that may be attributed to our products as well, which could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. With respect to China, although the government has recently been increasingly active in policing counterfeit pharmaceuticals, there is not yet an effective counterfeit pharmaceutical regulation control and enforcement system in China. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from selling or purporting to sell our products in China. The proliferation of counterfeit pharmaceuticals has grown in recent years and may continue to grow in the future. The existence of and any increase in the sales and production of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, or the technological capabilities of counterfeiters, could negatively impact our revenues, brand reputation, business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. For example, while we have received approval of our marketing authorization applications for roxadustat in the European Union, Great Britain, China, Japan, South Korea, and Chile for CKD anemia for patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, we received a CRL in the U.S. from the FDA. It is possible that roxadustat will not obtain regulatory approval in additional countries or indications. It is possible that our other product candidates we may discover, in-license or acquire and seek to develop in the future, will not obtain regulatory approval in any particular jurisdiction.\nOur current and future relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, privacy and security laws, and other regulations. If we are unable to comply with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur current and future relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors are subject to health care laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. If we obtain approval in the U.S. for any of our product candidates, the regulatory requirements applicable to our operations, in particular our sales and marketing efforts, will increase significantly with respect to our operations and the potential for administrative, civil and criminal enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments will increase with respect to the conduct of our business. The laws that may affect our operations in the U.S. include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nforeign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022\nthe Trade Agreements Act (\u201cTAA\u201d), which requires that drugs sold to the U.S. Government must be manufactured in the U.S. or in TAA approved and designated countries. Drugs manufactured in countries not approved under the TAA, may not be sold to the U.S. without specific regulatory approval. We have little experience with this regulation and there is a risk that drugs made from Chinese-made API may not be sold to an entity of the U.S. such as the Veterans Health Administration due to our inability to obtain regulatory approval. While there have been recent Veterans Health Administration policy changes that appear to allow for sale of drugs from non-TAA approved countries, this policy may change or there may be additional policies or legislation that affect our ability to sell drug to the U.S. Government.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to healthcare laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. Such actions could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common shares and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing corruption, which will require us to maintain costly compliance programs.\nWe must comply with a wide range of laws and regulations to prevent corruption, bribery, and other unethical business practices, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other countries, particularly China. The implementation and maintenance of compliance programs is costly and such programs may be difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nAnti-bribery laws prohibit us, our employees, and some of our agents or representatives from offering or providing any personal benefit to covered government officials to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests other than the missions of the public organizations in which they serve. Certain commercial bribery rules also prohibit offering or providing any personal benefit to employees and representatives of commercial companies to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests other than their employers. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the Department of Justice. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with these anti-bribery laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the anti-bribery laws present particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because in many countries including China, hospitals are state-owned or operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign government officials. Furthermore, in certain countries (China in particular), hospitals and clinics are permitted to sell pharmaceuticals to their patients and are primary or significant distributors of pharmaceuticals. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical studies, procurement of pharmaceuticals and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials that have led to vigorous anti-bribery law enforcement actions and heavy fines in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and China.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter violations, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, corrupt practices include, among others, acceptance of kickbacks, bribes or other illegal gains or benefits by the hospitals and medical practitioners from pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors or their third-party agents in connection with the prescription of certain pharmaceuticals. If our employees, partners, affiliates, subcontractors, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal practices with respect to their sales or marketing of our products or other activities involving our products, we could be required to pay damages or heavy fines by multiple jurisdictions where we operate, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The Chinese government has also sponsored anti-corruption campaigns from time to time, which could have a chilling effect on any future marketing efforts by us to new hospital customers. There have been recent occurrences in which certain hospitals have denied access to sales representatives from pharmaceutical companies because the hospitals wanted to avoid the perception of corruption. If this attitude becomes widespread among our potential customers, our ability to promote our products to hospitals may be adversely affected.\nAs we expand our operations in China and other jurisdictions internationally, we will need to increase the scope of our compliance programs to address the risks relating to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Our compliance programs will need to include policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions, including China, provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and include effective training for our personnel throughout our organization. The creation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. Violation of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws can result in significant administrative and criminal penalties for us and our employees, including substantial fines, suspension or debarment from government contracting, prison sentences, or even the death penalty in extremely serious cases in certain countries. The SEC also may suspend or bar us from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violation of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Even if we are not ultimately punished by government authorities, the costs of investigation and review, distraction of our personnel, legal defense costs, and harm to our reputation could be substantial and could limit our profitability or our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. In addition, if any of our competitors are not subject to the FCPA, they may engage in practices that will lead to their receipt of preferential treatment from foreign hospitals and enable them to secure business from foreign hospitals in ways that are unavailable to us.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, which have been remediated. If we otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, it may result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies.\nAs disclosed in our Annual Report, as of September 30, 2020, we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control as we did not appropriately design and maintain an effective risk assessment process at a precise enough level to identify new and evolving risks of material misstatement to the financial statements as a result of changes in our business operation. This material weakness gave rise to the following additional control deficiencies, which we also determined to be material weaknesses. We did not design and maintain effective controls related to the timely identification of shipments associated with drug product revenue and we did not design and maintain effective controls related to the timely identification of changes in estimated variable consideration related to drug product revenue. Each of these material weaknesses could have resulted in material misstatements in the drug product revenue, contract asset, or contract liability account balances or disclosures in our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. The material weaknesses described above did not result in any material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or disclosures, but did result in immaterial out-of-period adjustments to drug product revenue related to pre-commercial shipments of drug product, contract assets and contract liabilities, and related financial statement disclosures during the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\nSince these material weaknesses were identified, we have implemented measures designed to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to these material weaknesses and have concluded that these material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2021. See Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in our Annual Report for additional information regarding the identified material weaknesses and our remedial efforts.\nRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure on our financial resources and processes. If we experience additional material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, our liquidity, our access to capital markets may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC listing requirements, we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline.\nThe impact of U.S. healthcare reform may adversely affect our business model.\nIn the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could affect our operations. In particular, the commercial potential for our approved products could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the U.S. and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.\nFurther, in the U.S. there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government payor programs, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products if approved or additional pricing pressures. Further, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRoxadustat is considered a Class 2 substance on the 2019 World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List that could limit sales and increase security and distribution costs for our partners and us.\nRoxadustat is considered a Class 2 substance on the World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List. There are enhanced security and distribution procedures we and our collaboration partners and third-party contractors will have to take to limit the risk of loss of product in the supply chain. As a result, our distribution, manufacturing and sales costs for roxadustat, as well as for our partners, will be increased which will reduce profitability. In addition, there is a risk of reduced sales due to patient access to this drug.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or improper activities, which could result in significant liability or harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failure to:\n\u2022\ncomply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nprovide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with manufacturing standards we have established;\n\u2022\ncomply with privacy laws protecting personal information;\n\u2022\ncomply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data accurately; or\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us.\nEmployee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, or serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct for our directors, officers and employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impacts of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. An unfavorable outcome or settlement in connection with a governmental investigation or other action or lawsuit may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, and stock price. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and governmental investigations can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health or safety laws and regulations, we could incur fines, penalties or other costs.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations in the U.S. and foreign countries. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or manufacturing efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe have established operations in China and are seeking approval to commercialize our product candidates outside of the U.S., and a number of risks associated with international operations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to be subject to a number of risks related to our international operations, many of which may be beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in different countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent standards of care in various countries that could complicate the evaluation of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndifferent U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems and different competitive drugs indicated to treat the indications for which our product candidates are being developed;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the FCPA, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign taxes, including income, excise, customs, consumption, withholding, and payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating costs and expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\na reliance on CROs, clinical trial sites, principal investigators and other third parties that may be less experienced with clinical trials or have different methods of performing such clinical trials than we are used to in the U.S.;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by foreign distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions specific to an international region, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including the differing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each region.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated and such regulations are subject to change.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, encompassing the approval, registration, manufacturing, packaging, licensing and marketing of new drugs. In recent years, many aspects of pharmaceutical industry regulation have undergone significant reform, and reform may continue. For example, the Chinese government implemented regulations that impact distribution of pharmaceutical products in China, where at most two invoices may be issued throughout the distribution chain, a change that required us to change our distribution paradigm. Any regulatory changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs to our business or cause delays in or prevent the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates in China. Any failure by us or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of our business activities in China.\nThe China-operations portion of our audit is conducted by an independent registered public accounting firm that is not subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), which may negatively impact investor sentiment towards FibroGen or our China operations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe majority of audit work incurred for the audit report included in this Annual Report was performed by the U.S.-based independent registered public accounting firm we have retained, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which is headquartered in the U.S. and was not identified in the report issued by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 as a firm that the PCAOB was unable to inspect.\nHowever, we estimate that between 20% and 30% of the total audit hours for our December 31, 2021 audit were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP, which is headquartered in China. PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP was identified in the report issued by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 as a firm the PCAOB was unable to inspect.\nOn December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCAA\u201d) was signed into law. The HFCAA requires that the SEC identify issuers that retain an auditor that has a branch or office that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB determines it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that foreign jurisdiction. As PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, they are not currently subject to inspection. Amongst other things, the HFCAA requires the SEC to prohibit the securities of any issuer from being traded on any of the U.S. national securities exchanges, such as The Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), or on the U.S. \u201cover-the-counter\u201d markets, if the auditor of the issuer\u2019s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspections for three consecutive \u201cnon-inspection\u201d years after the law became effective.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cAHFCAA\u201d), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchange if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive \u201cnon-inspection\u201d years instead of three, thus reducing the time period before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. On February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which includes the exact same amendment as the bill passed by the Senate. The America COMPETES Act of 2022, however, includes a broader range of legislation than the AHFCAA in response to the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act passed by the U.S. Senate in 2021. The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate will need to agree on amendments to these respective bills to allow the legislature to pass their amended bills before the President can sign into law. It is unclear when the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives will resolve the differences or if and when the President will sign the bill to make the amendments into law.\nOn December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered accounting firms headquartered in China and in Hong Kong. PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP was named in this report.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments to its rules implementing the HFCAA and established procedures to identify issuers and prohibit the trading of the securities of certain registrants as required by the HFCAA. This rule stated that only the principal accountant, as defined by Rule 2-05 of Regulation S-X and PCAOB AS 1205, is \u201cdeemed \u2018retained\u2019 for purposes of Section 104(i) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Commission\u2019s determination of whether the registrant should be a Commission Identified Issuer.\u201d The principal accountant, as defined, that we have retained is PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The HFCAA does not apply to registrants that retain a principal accountant that is headquartered in the U.S. and subject to PCAOB inspection. Accordingly, the HFCAA does not currently apply to us.\nIf our operations fundamentally change in a way that requires our independent registered public accounting firm be located in China or Hong Kong in order to comply with the standards of the PCAOB regarding principal auditor then the HFCAA would apply to us, including the potential delisting from Nasdaq and prohibition from trading in the over-the counter market in the U.S. Such a restriction would negatively impact our ability to raise capital. We view the likelihood to be remote that our operations will fundamentally change so as to require our principal auditor to be located in China or Hong Kong. Additionally, it is possible that in the future Congress could amend the HFCAA or the SEC could modify its regulations to apply the restrictions, including trading prohibitions and delisting, under the HFCAA in situations in which an independent registered public accounting firm in China or Hong Kong performs part of the audit such as in our current situation. There are currently no such proposals.\nInspections of auditors conducted by the PCAOB in territories outside of China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China prevents the PCAOB from evaluating the effectiveness of such audits and such auditors\u2019 quality control procedures. The component of our audit that was performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP and the work papers associated with such audit work is not currently subject to inspection by the PCAOB. As a result, investors are deprived of the potential benefits of such PCAOB inspections for this portion of our audit, which could cause investors and potential investors in our common stock to lose confidence in the audit procedures conducted by our U.S. auditor\u2019s China-based subsidiary, which may negatively impact investor sentiment towards us or our China operations, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in U.S. and China relations, as well as relations with other countries, and/or regulations may adversely impact our business.\nThe U.S. government, including the SEC, has made statements and taken certain actions that have led to changes to U.S. and international relations, and will impact companies with connections to the U.S. or China, including imposing several rounds of tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in China, imposing certain sanctions and restrictions in relation to China, and issuing statements indicating enhanced review of companies with significant China-based operations. It is unknown whether and to what extent new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws or regulations will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on companies with significant connections to the U.S. or to China, our industry or on us. We conduct manufacturing and development activities and have business operations both in the U.S. and China. Any unfavorable government policies on cross-border relations and/or international trade, including increased scrutiny on companies with significant China-based operations, capital controls or tariffs, may affect the competitive position of our drug products, the hiring of scientists and other research and development personnel, the demand for our drug products, the import or export of products and product components, our ability to raise capital, the market price of our common stock, or prevent us from commercializing and selling our drug products in certain countries.\nWhile we do not operate in an industry that is currently subject to foreign ownership limitations in China, China could decide to limit foreign ownership in our industry, in which case there could be a risk that we would be unable to do business in China as we are currently structured. In addition, our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC may be subject to enhanced review by the SEC and this additional scrutiny could affect our ability to effectively raise capital in the U.S.\nIf any new legislation, executive orders, tariffs, laws and/or regulations are implemented, if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if the U.S. or Chinese governments take retaliatory actions due to the recent U.S.-China tension, such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our common stock.\nWe have limited experience distributing drugs in China.\nWe have established a jointly owned entity with AstraZeneca in China, one that has a distribution license. It is subject to a new body of regulations pertaining to distribution with which we have limited experience. This new distribution structure may impose higher costs or limit or delay our ability to sell products to our principal customers, and may limit the near term sales of our products. There are operational risks associated with the jointly owned entity, such as working capital funding requirements and regulatory challenges, which could impact our ability to operate in China, including increasing sales of roxadustat. We have limited experience managing distribution of pharmaceutical products, and this new distribution structure may impose higher costs or limit or delay our ability to sell products to our principal customers, and may limit the near term sales of our products.\nWe use our own manufacturing facilities in China to produce roxadustat API and drug product for the market in China. There are risks inherent to operating commercial manufacturing facilities, and with these being our single source suppliers, we may not be able to continually meet market demand.\nWe have two manufacturing facilities in China, with one located in Beijing and the other in Cangzhou, Hebei.\nWe will be obligated to comply with continuing cGMP requirements and there can be no assurance that we will maintain all of the appropriate licenses required to manufacture our product candidates for clinical and commercial use in China. In addition, our product suppliers and we must continually spend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality assurance and appropriate controls in order to ensure that any products manufactured in our facilities meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety, efficacy and quality and there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to be successful in meeting these requirements.\nManufacturing facilities in China are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the NMPA and other regulatory authorities. We expect to depend on these facilities for our product candidates and business operations in China, and we do not yet have a secondary source supplier for either roxadustat API or drug product in China. Natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophic events, including power interruptions, water shortages, storms, fires, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), earthquakes, terrorist attacks, government appropriation of our facilities, and wars, could significantly impair our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities. Certain equipment, records and other materials located in these facilities would be difficult to replace or would require substantial replacement lead-time that would impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in China. The occurrence of any such event could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nAs a company, we have limited experience in pharmacovigilance, medical affairs, and management of the third-party distribution logistics, and cannot assure you we will be able to meet regulatory requirements or operate in these capacities successfully.\nWe are responsible for commercial manufacturing, pharmacovigilance, medical affairs, and management of the third-party distribution logistics (with AstraZeneca through a jointly owned entity that will perform roxadustat distribution) for roxadustat commercial activities in China. While we have been increasing our staffing in these areas, as a company, we have limited experience managing or operating these functions for a commercial product and there can be no guarantee that we will do so efficiently or effectively. Mistakes or delays in these areas could limit our ability to successfully commercialize roxadustat in China, could limit our eventual market penetration, sales and profitability, and could subject us to significant liability in China.\nOur collaboration partner in China, AstraZeneca, and we may experience difficulties in successfully growing and sustaining sales of roxadustat in China.\nAstraZeneca and we have a profit sharing arrangement with respect to roxadustat in China and any difficulties we may experience in growing and sustaining sales will affect our bottom line. Difficulties may be related to our ability to maintain reasonable pricing and reimbursement, obtain and maintain hospital listing, or other difficulties related to distribution, marketing, and sales efforts in China. Our current National Reimbursement Drug List reimbursement pricing is effective for a standard two-year period (between January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023), after which time we will have to negotiate a new price for roxadustat. Sales of roxadustat in China may ultimately be limited due to the complex nature of the healthcare system, low average personal income, pricing controls, still developing infrastructure and potentially rapid competition from other products.\nThe retail prices of any product candidates that we develop may be subject to pricing control in China and elsewhere.\nThe price for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated in China, both at the national and provincial level. Price controls may reduce prices to levels significantly below those that would prevail in less regulated markets or limit the volume of products that may be sold, either of which may have a material and adverse effect on potential revenues from sales of roxadustat in China. Moreover, the process and timing for the implementation of price restrictions is unpredictable, which may cause potential revenues from the sales of roxadustat to fluctuate from period to period.\nFibroGen (China) Medical Technology Development Co., Ltd. (\u201cFibroGen Beijing\u201d) would be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict our ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements.\nWe plan to conduct all of our business in China through FibroGen China Anemia Holdings, Ltd., FibroGen Beijing and its branch offices, and our joint venture distribution entity, Beijing Falikang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (\u201cFalikang\u201d). We do not currently rely on revenue from China to fund our operations outside of China. However, we may in the future rely on dividends and royalties paid by FibroGen Beijing for a portion of our cash needs, including the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating costs and expenses. The payment of dividends by FibroGen Beijing is subject to limitations. Regulations in China currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. FibroGen Beijing is not permitted to distribute any profits until losses from prior fiscal years have been recouped and in any event must maintain certain minimum capital requirements. FibroGen Beijing is also required to set aside at least 10.0% of its after-tax profit based on Chinese accounting standards each year to its statutory reserve fund until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50.0% of its registered capital. Statutory reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, if FibroGen Beijing incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the agreements governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $69.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held in China.\nAny capital contributions from us to FibroGen Beijing must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce in China, and failure to obtain such approval may materially and adversely affect the liquidity position of FibroGen Beijing.\nThe Ministry of Commerce in China or its local counterpart must approve the amount and use of any capital contributions from us to FibroGen Beijing, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations and obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to do so, we may not be able to contribute additional capital to fund our Chinese operations, and the liquidity and financial position of FibroGen Beijing may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency exchange restrictions with respect to our operations in China, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nMost of our product sales will occur in local Chinese currency and our operating results will be subject to volatility from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not hedged against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results. Changes in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other currencies are affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. Currently, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Any significant currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and the remittance of foreign currency out of China for certain transactions. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of FibroGen Beijing to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and balance of trade, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local branch is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Chinese government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our operational requirements, our liquidity and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause FibroGen Beijing\u2019s funds are held in banks that do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which FibroGen Beijing deposits its funds could adversely affect our business.\nBanks and other financial institutions in China do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. As a result, in the event of a bank failure, FibroGen Beijing may not have access to funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money FibroGen Beijing maintains in a bank that fails, its inability to have access to cash could materially impair its operations.\nWe may be subject to tax inefficiencies associated with our offshore corporate structure.\nThe tax regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate are extremely complex and subject to change. New laws, new interpretations of existing laws, such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and any legislation proposed by the relevant taxing authorities, or limitations on our ability to structure our operations and intercompany transactions may lead to inefficient tax treatment of our revenue, profits, royalties, and distributions, if any are achieved. For example, the Biden administration has proposed to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21%, increase the U.S. taxation of our international business operations and impose a global minimum tax. Such proposed changes, as well as regulations and legal decisions interpreting and applying these changes, may adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nIn addition, our foreign subsidiaries and we have various intercompany transactions. We may not be able to obtain certain benefits under relevant tax treaties to avoid double taxation on certain transactions among our subsidiaries. If we are not able to avail ourselves to the tax treaties, we could be subject to additional taxes, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted which instituted various changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. Since inception, various regulations and interpretations have been issued by governing authorities and we continue to examine the impacts to our business, which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOur foreign operations, particularly those in China, are subject to significant risks involving the protection of intellectual property.\nWe seek to protect the products and technology that we consider important to our business by pursuing patent applications in China and other countries, relying on trade secrets or pharmaceutical regulatory protection or employing a combination of these methods. We note that the filing of a patent application does not mean that we will be granted a patent, or that any patent eventually granted will be as broad as requested in the patent application or will be sufficient to protect our technology. There are a number of factors that could cause our patents, if granted, to become invalid or unenforceable or that could cause our patent applications not to be granted, including known or unknown prior art, deficiencies in the patent application, or lack of originality of the technology. Furthermore, the terms of our patents are limited. The patents we hold and the patents that may be granted from our currently pending patent applications have, absent any patent term adjustment or extension, a twenty-year protection period starting from the date of application.\nIntellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as those in the U.S. or other countries for many reasons, including lack of procedural rules for discovery and evidence, low damage awards, and lack of judicial independence. Implementation and enforcement of China intellectual property laws have historically been deficient and ineffective and may be hampered by corruption and local protectionism. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive, and we may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. The experience and capabilities of China courts in handling intellectual property litigation varies and outcomes are unpredictable. An adverse determination in any such litigation could materially impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business.\nUncertainties with respect to the China legal system and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe legal system of China is a civil law system primarily based on written statutes. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control, perceived government interference and/or changes in tax, cyber and data security, capital investments, cross-border transactions and other regulations that are currently or may in the future be applicable to us. Recently, Chinese regulators announced regulatory actions aimed at providing China\u2019s government with greater oversight over certain sectors of China\u2019s economy, including the for-profit education sector and technology platforms that have a quantitatively significant number of users located in China. Although the biotech industry is already highly regulated in China and while there has been no indication to date that such actions or oversight would apply to companies that are similarly situated as us and that are pursuing similar portfolios of drug products and therapies as us, China\u2019s government may in the future take regulatory actions that may materially adversely affect the business environment and financial markets in China as they relate to us, our ability to operate our business, our liquidity and our access to capital.\nUnlike in a common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but are not binding. Because the China legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. Moreover, decision makers in the China judicial system have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, which may render it difficult for FibroGen Beijing to enforce the contracts it has entered into with our business partners, customers and suppliers. Different government departments may have different interpretations of certain laws and regulations, and licenses and permits issued or granted by one government authority may be revoked by a higher government authority at a later time. Furthermore, new laws or regulations may be passed, in some cases with little advance notice, that affect the way we or our collaboration partner do business in China (including the manufacture, sale, or distribution of roxadustat in China). Our business may be affected if we rely on laws and regulations that are subsequently adopted or interpreted in a manner different from our understanding of these laws and regulations. Navigating the uncertainty and change in the China legal and regulatory systems will require the devotion of significant resources and time, and there can be no assurance that our contractual and other rights will ultimately be maintained or enforced.\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, governmental, or social conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChinese society and the Chinese economy continue to undergo significant change. Changes in the regulatory structure, regulations, and economic policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in China. The Chinese government continues to adjust economic policies to promote economic growth. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations in China may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. Recently, Chinese regulators announced regulatory actions aimed at providing China\u2019s government with greater oversight over certain sectors of China\u2019s economy, including the for-profit education sector and technology platforms that have a quantitatively significant number of users located in China. Although the biotech industry is already highly regulated in China and while there has been no indication to date that such actions or oversight would apply to companies that are similarly situated as us and that are pursuing similar portfolios of drug products and therapies as us, China\u2019s government may in the future take regulatory actions that may materially adversely affect the business environment and financial markets in China as they relate to us. As the Chinese pharmaceutical industry grows and evolves, the Chinese government may also implement measures to change the regulatory structure and structure of foreign investment in this industry. We are unable to predict the frequency and scope of such policy changes and structural changes, any of which could materially and adversely affect FibroGen Beijing\u2019s development and commercialization timelines, liquidity, access to capital, and its ability to conduct business in China. Any failure on our part to comply with changing government regulations and policies could result in the loss of our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in China. In addition, the changing government regulations and policies could result in delays and cost increases to our development, manufacturing, approval, and commercialization timelines in China.\nWe may be subject to additional Chinese requirements, approvals or permissions in the future.\nWe are incorporated in the state of Delaware. To operate our general business activities currently conducted in China, each of our Chinese subsidiaries (and our joint venture with AstraZeneca, Falikang) is required to and does obtain a business license from the local counterpart of the State Administration for Market Regulation. Such business licenses list the business activities we are authorized to carry out and we would be noncompliant if we act outside of the scope of business activities set forth under the relevant business license.\nDue to China\u2019s regulatory framework in general and for the pharmaceutical industry specifically, we are required to apply for and maintain many approvals or permits specific to many of our business activities, including but not limited to manufacturing, distribution, environment protection, workplace safety, cybersecurity, from both national and local government agencies. For example, FibroGen Beijing is required to maintain a Drug Product Production Permit that allows it to manufacture API and roxadustat capsules. Falikang, our joint venture with AstraZeneca, is required to maintain a Drug Product Distribution Permit in order to be able to distribute our drug product roxadustat in China. For certain of our clinical trials conducted in China, we need to obtain, through the clinical sites, permits from the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China to collect samples that include human genetic resources, such as blood samples.\nWe may also be required to obtain certain approvals from Chinese authorities before transferring certain scientific data abroad or to foreign parties or entities established or actually controlled by them.\nNone of our subsidiaries or our joint venture in China are required to obtain approval or prior permission from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Cyberspace Administration of China, or any other Chinese regulatory authority under the Chinese laws and regulations currently in effect to issue securities to our investors. However, the approvals and permits we do have to comply with are numerous and there are uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system and changes in laws, regulations and policies, including how those laws and regulations will be interpreted or implemented. For further information, see the risk factor titled \u201cUncertainties with respect to the China legal system and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to new or changing requirements, approvals or permissions in the future in order to operate in China.\nIf we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals or permissions in order to operate our business in China, if we inadvertently conclude that such approvals or permissions are not required, or if we are subject to additional requirements, approvals, or permissions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and the market price of our common stock.\nIf the Chinese government determines that our corporate structure does not comply with Chinese regulations, or if Chinese regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, the value of our common stock may decline.\nIn July 2021, the Chinese government provided new guidance on China-based companies raising capital outside of China, including through arrangements called variable interest entities, or VIEs. We do not employ a VIE structure for purposes of replicating foreign investment in Chinese-based companies where Chinese law prohibits direct foreign investment. We do not operate in an industry that is currently subject to foreign ownership limitations in China. However, there are uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system and there may be changes in laws, regulations and policies, including how those laws and regulations will be interpreted or implemented. For further information, see the risk factor titled \u201cUncertainties with respect to the China legal system and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d If in the future the Chinese government determines that our corporate structure does not comply with Chinese regulations, or if Chinese laws or regulations change or are interpreted differently from our understanding of these laws and regulations, the value of our common stock may decline.\nOur operations in China subject us to various Chinese labor and social insurance laws, and our failure to comply with such laws may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to China Labor Contract Law, which provides strong protections for employees and imposes many obligations on employers. The Labor Contract Law places certain restrictions on the circumstances under which employers may terminate labor contracts and require economic compensation to employees upon termination of employment, among other things. In addition, companies operating in China are generally required to contribute to labor union funds and the mandatory social insurance and housing funds. Any failure by us to comply with Chinese labor and social insurance laws may subject us to late fees, fines and penalties, or cause the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct business in China, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur business could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business, and delay our research, clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the progression of the disease and the efficacy of vaccines and other therapeutics in preventing and treating current and future COVID-19 variants.\nWe have seen impacts from COVID-19 on all of our clinical trials to varying degrees, but COVID-19 has most heavily impacted our clinical trial timelines in IPF, DMD, and MDS. There is a risk that our clinical trials could be further delayed by additional COVID-19 outbreaks, which could slow or pause enrollment or site initiation. In addition, while we are trying to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on existing patients, it is possible that some patients may not be able to continue to comply with protocols, which could further delay our clinical trial progress.\nWe believe we have sufficient roxadustat and pamrevlumab supplies for our expected commercial and clinical requirements over the next year. However, we only have a limited stockpile of these drug supply products, and therefore, further outbreaks or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic,, or if manufacturing operations are halted again, or if drug product expires due to slowed clinical trials, or if the U.S. or international markets experience further economic slowdown or volatility, we could face shortages in our global supply chains. COVID-19 has created increased demand for the limited global biologics manufacturing capacity, and for manufacturing supplies, including for vials, reagents, supplements and media. Any such supply disruptions could adversely impact our clinical development and ability to generate revenues from our approved products and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nDue to these and potentially additional business disruptions, there may be delays to any of our business areas including those outlined above, as well as in regulatory, distribution, warehousing and other development, commercialization and launch efforts. In addition, COVID-19 presents an ongoing health risk to our employees, including members of senior management, thus limiting productivity. The full extent of these potential effects are unknown, but any of which could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTo the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability. We may require additional financings in order to fund our operations.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with two lead product candidates in clinical development, roxadustat for anemia in CKD, MDS, and chemotherapy-induced anemia, and pamrevlumab for IPF, pancreatic cancer, and DMD. Most of our revenue generated to date has been based on our collaboration agreements and we have limited commercial drug product sales to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $290.0 million, $189.3 million and $77.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $405.2 million plus $167.8 million of long-term investments classified as available for sale securities. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had $17.4 million accounts receivable in our current assets. Despite contractual development and cost coverage commitments from our collaboration partners, AstraZeneca and Astellas, and the potential to receive milestone and other payments from these partners, and despite commercialization efforts in the China and Japan for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia caused by CKD, we anticipate we will continue to incur losses on an annual basis for the foreseeable future. If we do not successfully develop and continue to obtain regulatory approval for our existing or any future product candidates and effectively manufacture, market and sell the product candidates that are approved, we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our operations in China, expand our clinical development efforts on pamrevlumab, continue to seek regulatory approval, establish commercialization capabilities of our product candidates, and pursue additional indications. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical trials and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions, and manufacturing and supplying products and product candidates for our partners and ourselves. The outcome of any clinical trial and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we are unable to fully estimate the actual costs necessary to successfully complete the development and regulatory approval process for our compounds in development and any future product candidates. We believe that the net proceeds from our 2017 public offerings, our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and accounts receivable, and expected third-party collaboration revenues will allow us to fund our operating plans through at least the next 12 months. Our operating plans or third-party collaborations may change as a result of many factors, including the success of our development and commercialization efforts, operations costs (including manufacturing and regulatory), competition, and other factors that may not currently be known to us, and we therefore may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through offerings of public or private securities, debt financings or other sources, such as royalty monetization or other structured financings. Such financings may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. We may also seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we currently believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we require them, or on terms that are acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development efforts or other operations or activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nMost of our recent revenue has been earned from collaboration partners for our product candidates under development.\nIf either or both of our Astellas and AstraZeneca collaborations were to be terminated, we could require significant additional capital in order to proceed with development and commercialization of our product candidates, including with respect to our potential commercialization of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia caused by CKD, or we may require additional partnering in order to help fund such development and commercialization. If adequate funds or partners are not available to us on a timely basis or on favorable terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development or commercialization efforts or other operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials and commercialization, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, commercialization and administration capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to increase the responsibilities of management. Our failure to accomplish any of these steps could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy and maintaining the confidence of investors in us.\nLoss of senior management and key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our senior management team, including Enrique Conterno, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Conterno or any of our senior management could significantly impact the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified commercial, development, scientific, clinical, and manufacturing personnel are and will continue to be critical to our success, particularly as we expand our commercialization operations. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize product candidates. We may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies for similar personnel.\nThere is also significant competition, in particular in the San Francisco Bay Area, for the hiring of experienced and qualified personnel, which increases the importance of retention of our existing personnel. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain personnel with the quality and experience applicable to our product candidates, our ability to pursue our strategy will be limited and our business and operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, regulatory proceedings, and other legal matters, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands, investigations and/or other dispute-related matters involving, among other things, our products, product candidates, or other issues relating to our business as well as allegations of violation of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, competition, securities, consumer protection, and the environment.\nFor example, we and certain of our current and former executive officers have been named as defendants in a consolidated putative class action lawsuit (\u201cSecurities Class Action Litigation\u201d) and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors have been named as defendants in a derivative lawsuit (\u201cDerivative Litigation\u201d). The complaint filed in the Securities Class Action Litigation alleges violations of the securities laws, including, among other things, that the defendants made certain materially false and misleading statements about our Phase 3 clinical studies data and prospects for FDA approval. The complaint filed in the Derivative Litigation asserts claims based on some of the same alleged misstatements and omissions as the Securities Class Action Litigation and seeks, among other things, unspecified damages. We intend to vigorously defend the claims made in the Securities Class Action Litigation and Derivative Litigation; however, the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted, and the claims raised in these lawsuits may result in further legal matters or actions against us, including, but not limited to, government enforcement actions or additional private litigation. In the fourth quarter of 2021, FibroGen received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to roxadustat\u2019s pooled cardiovascular safety data. We have been fully cooperating with the SEC\u2019s investigation.\nWe cannot predict whether any particular legal matter will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, government enforcement actions, bars against serving as an officer or director, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or certain members of our senior management. For additional information regarding our pending litigation and SEC investigation, refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management\u2019s attention and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, and stock price. In addition, such legal matters could negatively impact our reputation among our customers, collaboration partners or our shareholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings or regulatory investigations, as well as damage to our reputation.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit commercial operations.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing, manufacturing and commercialization of our product candidates. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in a product, negligence, strict liability or breach of warranty. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we are unable to obtain insurance coverage at levels that are appropriate to maintain our business and operations, or if we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or otherwise cease operations. Product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ntermination of further development of unapproved product candidates or significantly reduced demand for any approved products;\n\u2022\nmaterial costs and expenses to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of time and resources across the entire organization, including our executive management;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling restrictions;\n\u2022\ntermination of our collaboration relationships or disputes with our collaboration partners; and\n\u2022\nreputational damage negatively impacting our other product candidates in development.\nIf we fail to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims, we may not be able to continue to develop our product candidates. We maintain product liability insurance in a customary amount for the stage of development of our product candidates. Although we believe that we have sufficient coverage based on the advice of our third-party advisors, there can be no assurance that such levels will be sufficient for our needs. Moreover, our insurance policies have various exclusions, and we may be in a dispute with our carrier as to the extent and nature of our coverage, including whether we are covered under the applicable product liability policy. If we are not able to ensure coverage or are required to pay substantial amounts to settle or otherwise contest the claims for product liability, our business and operations would be negatively affected.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs, collaboration partners, and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We upgraded our disaster and data recovery capabilities in 2019, and have continued to upgrade these capabilities. However, to the extent that any disruption or security breach, in particular with our partners\u2019 operations, results in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and it could result in a material disruption and delay of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems and could face a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption. While we upgraded our disaster data recovery program in March 2019, a successful attack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. We have invested in our systems and the protection and recoverability of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption, and we monitor and test our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling such cyber-attacks and any such attacks could result in losses described above as well as disputes with physicians, patients and our partners, regulatory sanctions or penalties, increases in operating costs and expenses, expenses or lost revenues or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows.\nOur headquarters are located near known earthquake fault zones.\nWe and some of the third-party service providers on which we depend for various support functions are vulnerable to damage from catastrophic events, such as power loss, natural disasters, terrorism and similar unforeseen events beyond our control. Our corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes and fires, and has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic disruption resulting from the related shelter-in-place and stay-at-home governmental orders.\nAfter a comprehensive earthquake risk analysis conducted by Marsh Risk, we decided not to purchase earthquake or flood insurance. Based upon (among other factors) the Marsh Risk analysis, the design and construction of our building, the expected potential loss, and the costs and deductibles associated with earthquake and flood insurance, we chose to self-insure. However, earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, or have a larger cost than expected, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, damaged critical infrastructure, or otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place are unlikely to provide adequate protection in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nIn general, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks have been highly volatile in the current market. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks is sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and biotechnology and life science companies stocks often respond to trends and perceptions rather than financial performance. In particular, the market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors:\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates, including roxadustat and pamrevlumab;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the release of results of and regulatory updates regarding our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nsafety issues with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates and any approved products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, which will be significantly affected by the manner in which we recognize revenue from the achievement of milestones under our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our collaborations and our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe termination of a collaboration or the inability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or other regulatory developments affecting our product candidates or our industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of the biotechnology industry and particular companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nactivities of the government of China, including those related to the pharmaceutical industry as well as industrial policy generally;\n\u2022\nperformance of other U.S. publicly traded companies with significant operations in China;\n\u2022\nchanges in market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAs a result of fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons of our operating results across different periods may not be accurate indicators of our future performance. Any fluctuations that we report in the future may differ from the expectations of market analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. Moreover, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. We are currently subject to such litigation and it has diverted, and could continue to result in diversions of, our management\u2019s attention and resources and it could result in significant expense, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. For a description of our pending litigation and SEC investigation, refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise influence over stockholder approvals.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, owned approximately 50.20% of our common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options that are exercisable within 60 days after such date and shares issuable upon settlement of restricted stock units that will vest within 60 days after such date. This percentage is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and principal stockholders and Schedules 13D and 13G, if any, filed with the SEC, which information may not be accurate as of January 31, 2020. Accordingly, these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group may differ from those of other stockholders and they may vote their shares in a way that is contrary to the way other stockholders vote their shares. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management and/or the board of directors, delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our common stock.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders and harm our business.\nWe may, in the future, make acquisitions of or investments in companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our present or future product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for us. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u2022\nissue stock that would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u2022\nincur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will be viewed positively by customers, financial markets or investors. Furthermore, future acquisitions could pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies, or employees or other assets of the acquisition target;\n\u2022\nincreases to our expenses;\n\u2022\ndisclosed or undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u2022\nreprioritization of our development programs and even cessation of development and commercialization of our current product candidates;\n\u2022\nharm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\u2022\nentrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete any acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current directors or management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed prior to the end of their term only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority vote of the holders of our common stock or the majority vote of our board of directors to amend our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority vote of the holders of our common stock to amend the classification of our board of directors into three classes and to amend certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nChanges in our tax provision or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our income tax returns are subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine our tax estimates, a final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, excise, customs and duties, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, gross receipts, and goods and services taxes in the U.S., state and local, and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to audit and assessments by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and the determination of these non-income taxes is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of tax laws and regulations. Therefore, we may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe tax regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate are extremely complex and subject to change. Changes in tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign governments\u2019 trade policies have resulted in, and may continue to result in, tariffs on imports into and exports from the U.S. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China. In response, China has proposed and implemented their own tariffs on certain products, which may impact our supply chain and our costs of doing business. If we are impacted by the changing trade relations between the U.S. and China, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Continued diminished trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, including potential reductions in trade with China and others, as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates courts located in Delaware as the sole forum for certain proceedings, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws, or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. For example, the Derivative Litigation has been brought in federal court in California, despite the exclusive forum provision. In such an instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. If a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not plan to pay dividends. Capital appreciation will be your sole possible source of gain, which may never occur.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future and investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. We plan to retain any earnings to invest in our product candidates and maintain and expand our operations. Therefore, capital appreciation, or an increase in your stock price, which may never occur, may be the only way to realize any return on your investment.\nOur business or our share price could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder proposals or actions.\nPublic companies are facing increasing attention from stakeholders relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including corporate governance, executive compensation, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and diversity and inclusion. Key stakeholders may advocate for enhanced environmental, social and governance disclosures or policies or may request that we make corporate governance changes or engage in certain corporate actions that we believe are not currently in the best interest of FibroGen or our stockholders. Responding to challenges from stockholders, such as proxy contests or media campaigns, could be costly and time consuming and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operational results, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or experience volatility.", "PERMNO": 15065, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "FGEN"}
