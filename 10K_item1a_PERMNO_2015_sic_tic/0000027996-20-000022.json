RISK FACTORS\nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all currently known material risks. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.\nOur recently announced strategic plan to implement a new go-to-market strategy and more integrated operations, transforming us into a Trusted Business TechnologyTM company, is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our strategic and tactical initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these initiatives in a timely manner, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe strategic plan we announced during the second quarter of 2019 contemplates that our strategic and tactical initiatives will result in, among other things, sustained organic revenue growth and strong segment adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. We plan to achieve these results through a variety of initiatives, including greater integration of operations and technology platforms, a more streamlined sales process, more targeted cross-selling to our existing customer base, growing that customer base and reducing our cost structure. In support of these initiatives, we anticipate that we will expend significant resources on infrastructure investments to scale the business and to advance our ability to accelerate revenue growth, including investments in enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and human resources technology.\nOur strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nour failure to generate profitable revenue growth;\n\u2022\nour failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;\n\u2022\nour failure to implement sales technology that enables a single view of our customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to implement improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;\n\u2022\nour failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;\n\u2022\nour inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;\n\u2022\nour failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe can provide no assurance that our strategic and tactical initiatives will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment or that they will not materially reduce our EBITDA margins. Additionally, technology system implementations entail a significant degree of inherent risk, including disruptions that may impact our operations. Any of these circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our strategic plan is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategic plan is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we realigned our existing businesses into four reportable segments: Payments, Cloud Solutions, Promotional Solutions and Checks. If this realignment is not successful, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs we previously announced, we believe that we can achieve greater operational synergies, increase organic revenue growth and reduce overall costs by realigning our existing operations and managing the company based on our product and service offerings. Effective January 1, 2020, we began managing the company to focus on 4 primary focus areas: Payments, Cloud Solutions, Promotional Solutions and Checks. We appointed general managers for each of the 4 new focus areas and we continue to refine our new organization. Realignments such as this take time, considerable senior management effort, material \"buy-in\" from employees and significant investment. Additionally, our success is dependent on our ability to establish one culture around an enterprise model focused on the customer, as well as our ability to engage our employees and to inspire them to be open to change and to innovate. Transformations of this magnitude may temporarily reduce productivity. Further, we cannot guarantee that our transformation will be successful or result in the anticipated benefits, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, our response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results or certain partner referrals could decline. We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, our check supply contracts generally run for a period of 3 to 6 years. At the end of the contract term, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.\nAdditionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.\nWe face intense competition from other business enterprises, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.\nThe markets for our various service offerings are intensely competitive. Our competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. These service offerings are also rapidly evolving, creating opportunities for new competitors to enter the market. Current and potential competitors include, among others, financial institution core banking software providers, numerous financial technology service providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration, email and social media marketing services companies, payroll service providers and ePayments service providers. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must also compete with their in-house capabilities.\nThe market for promotional products and business forms is also intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies and small business product resellers, as well as providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced.\nAlthough we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry. In addition to competition from the digitization of payments, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and\nbusiness checks, from check printing software vendors and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. Although we continue to work with our large financial institution clients to renew check supply contracts for the long term, the pricing levels included in any contract renewal could be lower than our current pricing levels.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the success and integration of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe completed several acquisitions during the past 3 years, the details of which appear under the caption \u201cNote 6: Acquisitions\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. These acquisitions extended our range of products and services, including treasury management and data-driven marketing solutions and web services. In addition, over the past several years, we purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our enterprise accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring a strong system of information security and controls is in place;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries;\n\u2022\nunanticipated integration costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company;\n\u2022\ndecisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance and other complexity;\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies;\n\u2022\nfailure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and\n\u2022\nloss of key employees.\nOne or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have indicated that we plan to supplement organic revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with other sources of revenue.\nChecks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 39.0% of our consolidated revenue in 2019. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2019, the total number of checks written declined an average of 7.5% each year between 2015 and 2018, compared to an average decline of 3.4% each year between 2012 and 2015. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal\u00ae, Apple Pay\u00ae, Square\u00ae, Zelle\u00ae and Venmo\u00ae. In addition, the RTP\u00ae system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches over 50% of U.S. bank accounts. In August 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it plans to develop its own real-time payments system, with an expected launch in 2023 or 2024.\nThe rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative\npayment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is particularly essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Today, we have many brands associated with our products and services as a result of previous acquisitions. Unifying our brands to operate as one Deluxe is an essential part of our One Deluxe strategy. In February 2020, we unveiled our new Deluxe brand. Transitioning to one brand takes time and investment, and if the transition is not managed effectively, we could lose customers. We can also provide no assurance that our new branding strategy will be successful or will result in a positive return on our investment.\nTo promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. We currently have an agreement with television personality Ty Pennington, who appears in our online series, Small Business Revolution - Main Street. If Mr. Pennington, other business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. A security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers' sensitive data could materially harm our reputation. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or our failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.\nThe markets for many of the products and services we provide are characterized by constant change and innovation. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including the digitization of payments, could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires us to incur substantial costs. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.\nOur cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.\nIntense competition, secular declines in the use of checks and business forms and the commoditization of web services compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Additionally, we intend to utilize structural cost savings to fund a large portion of the investments required to implement our One Deluxe strategy. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing\nour strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to partially fund necessary investments, could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet and cloud-based activities, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. We use internet-based channels that collect customers\u2019 financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system application weaknesses.\nThe secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we rely on them to effectively monitor and oversee these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced external internet-based attacks by threat actors aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers\u2019 websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent \"phishing\" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.\nDespite our significant cybersecurity efforts, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that could impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance\ncoverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.\nThere are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.\nInterruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platforms, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control.\nOne of the cornerstones of our growth strategy is investment in our information technology infrastructure. We are investing significant resources to build out our technology platforms, including sales technology that enables a single view of our customers, thereby providing for deeper cross-sell opportunities. We implemented a human capital management system in January 2020, and we are also investing in our financial tools, including an enterprise resource planning system and a financial planning and analysis system. System implementations are complex. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of these systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.\nFurthermore, as we focus resources on our growth strategy, we have reduced our investment in the development of the systems that support our check and forms businesses, with a focus on sustaining and maintaining such systems. These systems operate with minimal or no vendor support, contain hardware and software that we are not able to update and are difficult to maintain, yet any interruption caused by a failure or breach of these systems could create disruption in these businesses.\nIn recent years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims.\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur.\nIf third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service\nproviders could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nFor us to successfully grow and compete, we must recruit, retain and develop the key personnel necessary to execute our growth strategy. This is of particular importance as we realign our existing operations in support of our growth strategy. The success of this realignment and our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management and development, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nThe cost and availability of materials, delivery and other third-party services could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials and other raw materials. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.\nWe depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for other outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products. We also rely on third-party providers for certain technology, processing and support functions. If we are unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant providers, we may be forced to obtain alternative suppliers at higher costs. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.\nThird-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and\nundesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, which could trigger enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective on January 1, 2020. Among other requirements, businesses subject to the CCPA are required to proactively explain privacy notices to consumers when personal information is collected and it provides California residents the right to demand that company-held personal data be shared with them or deleted. Several other states and the federal government are currently considering similar legislation.\nThe various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nPortions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses\u2019 customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.\nDue to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, \u201canti-spam\u201d regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.\nBecause of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.\nWe may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual\nproperty protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.\nActivities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.\nAs a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the \"dark web,\" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. The safeguards we have established may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially if the inappropriate activities are high profile.\nLaws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nGoodwill represented 41% of our total assets as of December 31, 2019. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in our business strategies, structure and/or the allocation of resources;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in market conditions, including increased competition;\n\u2022\nthe loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u2022\na downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results; or\n\u2022\na material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and forms.\nSuch situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets and assets held for sale. Information regarding our 2019 impairment analyses can be found under the caption \"Note 8: Fair value measurements\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nEconomic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. Economic conditions have a significant impact on our small business customers. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level\nof small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. The index of small business optimism published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) was 102.7 in December 2019, consistent with the average index for 2019 of 103.0, but down from the average index of 106.7 reported in 2018. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general economic conditions to be better in 6 months, as published by the NFIB, held steady at 16% in December 2019, the same as in December 2018. Additionally, consumer spending and employment levels remained strong throughout 2019. Overall, the small business economy appeared to be healthy in 2019. However, we cannot predict whether economic trends affecting small businesses will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.\nA significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry, including merger and acquisition activity. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.\nThe majority of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 61743, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "DLX"}
