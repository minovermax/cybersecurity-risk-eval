RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of the known factors that may materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities. Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nMarket prices of wholesale shell eggs are volatile and decreases in these prices can adversely impact our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices, which fluctuate widely and are outside our control. As a result, our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance. Small increases in production, or small decreases in demand, can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices. Shell egg prices trended upward from calendar 2002 until late 2003 and early 2004 when they rose to then historical highs. In the early fall of calendar 2004, the demand trend related to the increased popularity of high protein diets faded dramatically and prices fell. During the time of increased demand, the egg industry geared up to produce more eggs, resulting in an oversupply of eggs. After calendar 2006, supplies were more closely balanced with demand and egg prices again reached record levels in 2007 and 2008. Egg prices had subsequently retreated from those record price levels due to increases in industry supply before reaching new highs in 2014. In 2015, egg prices rose again due in part to a decrease in supply caused by the avian influenza outbreak in the upper Midwestern U.S. from April to June 2015. While the AI outbreak significantly impacted the supply and prices of eggs, there were no positive tests for AI at any of our locations. The average Urner-Barry Thursday prices for the large market (i.e. generic shell eggs) in the southeastern region for the months of June through November 2015 was $2.32 per dozen, with a peak of $2.97 during August. Subsequent to November 2015, shell egg prices have declined. Our average year to date selling price for shell eggs in fiscal 2016 of $1.735 was up 21.4% compared to fiscal 2015; however, our average selling price for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 of $1.152 was down 21.7% compared with the same period last year. Market prices for shell eggs have dropped significantly from the historically high levels we experienced at the beginning of this fiscal year. The Urner Barry price index hit a decade-low level during our fourth quarter, before recovering a portion of these declines in recent weeks. While retail demand trends for shell eggs have been favorable, there has been demand erosion for egg products and reduced egg exports. Based on USDA reports, the laying flock is expected to increase through the end of calendar 2016, creating more supply and the potential for further price declines. Egg prices will likely remain volatile and future prices will depend on levels of supply and the recovery of institutional demand for eggs.\n\ufeff\nRetail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest in the summer months. Prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer. Shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. Consequently, we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in August and May, respectively. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA decline in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nWe believe fast food restaurant consumption, reports from the medical community regarding the health benefits of shell eggs, reduced shell egg cholesterol levels, high protein diet trends and industry advertising campaigns have all contributed to shell egg demand. However, there can be no assurance that the demand for shell eggs will not decline in the future. Adverse publicity relating to health concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional value of shell eggs, as well as movement away from high protein diets, could adversely affect demand for shell eggs, which would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nFeed costs are volatile and increases in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFeed cost represents the largest element of our shell egg (farm) production cost, ranging from 60% to 69% of total farm production cost in the last five fiscal years. Although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources, we have little, if any,\ncontrol over the prices of the ingredients we purchase, which are affected by weather, speculators, various supply and demand factors, transportation and storage costs, and agricultural and energy policies in the U.S. and internationally. For example, the severe drought in the summer of 2012 and resulting damage to the national corn and soybean crops resulted in high and volatile feed costs. Increases in feed costs unaccompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Alternatively, low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction, possibly resulting in lower egg prices.\n\ufeff\nDue to the cyclical nature of our business, our financial results fluctuate from year to year and between different quarters within a single fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nThe shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. In the past, during periods of high profitability, shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs, which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance. As a result, our financial results from year to year vary significantly. Additionally, as a result of seasonal fluctuations, our financial results fluctuate significantly between different quarters within a single fiscal year.\n\ufeff\nWe purchase a portion of the shell eggs we sell from outside producers and our ability to obtain such eggs at prices and in quantities acceptable to us could fluctuate.\n\ufeff\nWe produced approximately 78% and 75% of the total number of shell eggs sold by us in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and purchased the remaining amount from outside producers. As the wholesale price for shell eggs increases, our cost to acquire shell eggs from outside producers increases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire shell eggs from outside producers in sufficient quantities and satisfactory prices, and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to continue to pursue a growth strategy, which includes acquisitions of other companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs. In fiscal year 2014 we completed the purchase of our joint venture partner\u2019s 50% interest in Delta Egg Farm, LLC; and in fiscal year 2013 we acquired the commercial egg assets of Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corporation and Maxim Production Co., Inc. Acquisitions require capital resources and can divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business. Acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct prior to our acquisition of a business that were unknown to us at the time of acquisition. We could incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we anticipated at the time of its purchase. We cannot assure you that we:\n\ufeff\n-\nwill identify suitable acquisition candidates;\n\ufeff\n-\ncan consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms;\n\ufeff\n-\ncan successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations; or\n\ufeff\n-\ncan successfully manage the operations of an acquired business.\n\ufeff\nNo assurance can be given that companies acquired by us in the future will contribute positively to our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, federal antitrust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance.\n\ufeff\nThe consideration we pay in connection with any acquisition also affects our financial results. If we pay cash, we could be required to use a portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of our Common Stock, existing stockholders may be diluted. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt.\n\ufeff\nOur largest customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced purchases by, one or more of our large customers.\n\ufeff\nFor the fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, two customers, Wal-Mart Stores and Sam\u2019s Clubs, on a combined basis, accounted for 28.9%, 25.7%, and 28.2% of our net sales dollars, respectively. For fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, our top ten customers accounted for 70.6%, 67.9%, and 68.5% of net sales dollars, respectively. Although we have established long-term\nrelationships with most of our customers, who continue to purchase from us based on our ability to service their needs, they are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources. If, for any reason, one or more of our larger customers were to purchase significantly less of our shell eggs in the future or terminate their purchases from us, and we are not able to sell our shell eggs to new customers at comparable levels, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with applicable governmental regulations, including environmental regulations, could harm our operating results, financial condition, and reputation. Further, we may incur significant costs to comply with any such regulations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control, and waste disposal. As a fully-integrated shell egg producer, our shell egg facilities are subject to regulation and inspection by the USDA, EPA, and FDA, as well as regulation by various state and local health and agricultural agencies. All of our shell egg production and feed mill facilities are subject to FDA regulation and inspections. In addition, rules are often proposed that, if adopted as proposed, could have the effect of increasing our costs. For example, in April 2016 the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service proposed rules that, if adopted, would change requirements, and increase our costs, for the production of organic eggs.\n\ufeff\nOur operations and facilities are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not limited to pollution/wastewater discharge permits.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to comply with an applicable law or regulation, or fail to obtain necessary permits, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions, our reputation could be harmed, and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.\n\ufeff\nShell eggs and shell egg products are susceptible to microbial contamination, and we may be required to or voluntarily recall contaminated products.\n\ufeff\nShell eggs and shell egg products are vulnerable to contamination by pathogens such as Salmonella. Shipment of contaminated products, even if inadvertent, could result in a violation of law and lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition, products purchased from other producers could contain contaminants that may be inadvertently redistributed by us. As such, we may decide or be required to recall a product if we or regulators believe it poses a potential health risk. We do not maintain insurance to cover recall losses. Any product recall could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products, adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAgricultural risks, including outbreaks of avian disease, could harm our business.\n\ufeff\nOur shell egg production activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Unusual or extreme weather conditions, disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs we produce and distribute. The Company maintains controls and procedures to reduce the risk of exposing our flocks to harmful diseases. Despite our best efforts, outbreaks of avian disease can still occur and may adversely impact the health of our flocks. An outbreak of avian disease could have a material adverse impact on our financial results by increasing government restrictions on the sale and distribution of our products. Negative publicity from an outbreak within our industry can negatively impact customer perception, even if the outbreak does not directly impact our flocks. If a substantial portion of our production facilities are affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nFrom April through June 2015, our industry experienced a significant avian influenza outbreak, primarily in the upper Midwestern U.S. Based on several published industry estimates, we believe that approximately 12% of the national flock of laying hens was affected. The affected laying hens were either destroyed by the disease or euthanized. The effect this outbreak had on our industry and our company is discussed throughout this report. There have been no positive tests for avian influenza at any of our locations, and we have significantly increased the biosecurity measures at all of our facilities; however we cannot be certain that our flocks will not be affected by AI or other diseases in the future.\n\ufeff\nOur business is highly competitive.\n\ufeff\nThe production and sale of fresh shell eggs, which have accounted for virtually all of our net sales in recent years, is intensely competitive. We compete with a large number of competitors that may prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling shell eggs. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any or all of these companies. In addition, increased competition could result in price reductions, greater cyclicality, reduced margins and loss of market share, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices and protect our image with our customers.\n\ufeff\nWe and many of our customers are facing pressure from animal rights groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, and the Humane Society of the United States, or HSUS, to require all companies that supply food products operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed or approved by these animal rights groups. The standards typically require minimum cage space for hens, among other requirements, but some of these groups have made legislative efforts to ban any form of caged housing in various states. California\u2019s Proposition 2 and Assembly Bill 1437 was effective January 1, 2015, and did increase the cost of production in that State and for producers who sell there. During our fiscal 2016 an increasing number of large restaurant chains, food service companies and grocery chains, including our largest customers, announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply chain by specified future dates. Changing our procedures and infrastructure to conform to these types of laws or anticipated customer demand for these types of guidelines has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs to our internal production of shell eggs, including capital and operating cost increases from housing and husbandry practices and modification of existing or construction of new facilities, and the increased cost for us to purchase shell eggs from our outside suppliers. While some of the increased costs have been passed on to our customers, we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to pass on these costs, or additional costs we will face, in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of this team may adversely affect the implementation of our business plan in a timely manner.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior management team. The loss or interruption of service of one or more of our key executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations effectively and/or pursue our growth strategy. We have not entered into any employment or non-compete agreements with any of our executive officers nor do we carry any significant key-man life insurance coverage on any such persons.\n\ufeff\nWe are controlled by the family of our founder, Fred R. Adams, Jr.\n\ufeff\nFred R. Adams, Jr., our Founder and Chairman Emeritus, and his spouse own 27.9% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, which has one vote per share. In addition, Mr. Adams and his spouse own 74.7% and his son-in-law, Adolphus B. Baker, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and his spouse own 25.3% of the outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock, which has ten votes per share. Mr. Baker and his spouse also own 1.4% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. A conservatorship has been established to manage Mr. Adams\u2019 affairs, with his spouse and Mr. Baker as co-conservators, as a result of the impairment of Mr. Adams\u2019 health related to his previously disclosed stroke. Mr. Adams continues to consult actively and regularly with the Company and it is expected that he will continue to do so for as long as he is able. As a result of the conservatorship, as of July 1, 2016, Mr. Adams, his spouse, and Mr. Baker possessed 52.4%, and Messrs. Adams and Baker and their spouses collectively possessed 66.3%, of the total voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. These stockholdings include shares of our Common Stock accumulated under our employee stock ownership plan for the respective accounts of Messrs. Adams and Baker and Mr. Baker\u2019s spouse.\n\ufeff\nThe Adams and Baker families intend to retain ownership of a sufficient amount of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock to assure continued ownership of over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock. Such ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of the Company more difficult and discourage certain types of transactions involving a change of control of our Company, including transactions in which the holders of Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation require that our Class A Common Stock be issued only to Fred R. Adams, Jr. and members of his immediate family, and if shares of our Class A Common Stock, by operation of law or otherwise, are deemed not to be owned by Mr. Adams or a member of his immediate family, the voting\npower of any such shares shall be automatically reduced to one vote per share. The Adams and Baker families\u2019 controlling ownership of our capital stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nBased on the Adams family\u2019s beneficial ownership of our outstanding capital stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d as defined in Rule 5615(c)(1) of the NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards. Accordingly, we are exempt from certain requirements of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance listing standards, including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and the nomination of directors by independent directors.\n\ufeff\nCurrent and any future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation.\n\ufeff\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. For a discussion of legal proceedings see Item 3 below. Such lawsuits are expensive to defend, divert management\u2019s attention, and may result in significant judgments or settlements. Legal proceedings may expose us to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference for our products and brands.\n\ufeff\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of May 28, 2016, we had $29.2 million of goodwill. While we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired, any future goodwill impairment charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period or our net worth.\n\ufeff\nThe loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us.\n\ufeff\nWe utilize intellectual property in our business. For example, we own the trademarks Farmhouse\u00ae, Rio Grande\u00ae, Sunups\u00ae, Sunny Meadow\u00ae and 4Grain\u00ae. We also produce and market Egg-Land\u2019s Best\u00ae and Land O\u2019 Lakes\u00ae under license agreements with EB. We have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands. The loss or expiration of any intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us by allowing our competitors to make and sell products substantially similar to those we offer. This could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell the associated products, thereby adversely affecting our operations.\n\ufeff\nExtreme weather, natural disasters or other events beyond our control could negatively impact our business.\n\ufeff\nFire, bioterrorism, pandemic, extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, production or availability of feed ingredients, or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from overtopped or breached wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\ufeff\nFailure of our information technology systems or software, or a security breach of those systems, could adversely affect our day-to-day operations and decision making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance.\n\ufeff\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, logistics, accounting and other business processes. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology environment, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including systems failures, viruses, security breaches or cyber incidents such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises.\nA security breach of such information could result in damage to our reputation, and could negatively impact our relations with our customers or employees. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 20598, "SIC": 200, "TIC": "CALM"}
