{"cik": "1358190", "company": "Orient Paper Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur liquidity position poses risk to our operations, especially our capacity expansion projects.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had current assets of approximately $26.6 million and current liabilities of approximately $44.5 million, resulting in a working capital deficiency of approximately $17.9 million. We are currently seeking to restructure the term of our liabilities by raising funds through long-term loans to pay off liabilities with shorter terms. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing or negotiating the terms of the existing short-term liabilities to meet our current and future liquidity needs. In the event that we fail to raise funds or negotiate terms of the current liabilities sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may be forced to substantially curtail our operations or otherwise take measures that would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and business prospects.\nIn addition to the working capital deficit, we had entered into contracts (mostly related to the construction of new tissue paper facilities and infrastructures at the Wei County Industrial Park) with capital expenditure commitments for approximately $24.6 million as of December 31, 2014. We intend to pay for these capital expenditure commitments with cash flows from operating activities and additional debt financing in next 12 months.\nOn January 20, 2014, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) Mr. Zhenyong Liu agreed in writing to permit the Company to continue to postpone the repayment of the accrued interest on his loan to Orient Paper HB until the Company is able to pay its other creditors in its normal course of business. The accrued interest owned to Mr. Liu was approximately $761,242, which was recorded in other payables and accrued liabilities as part of the current liabilities in the consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2014.\nOn March 9, 2015, the Company\u2019s CEO agreed in writing to permit the Company to postpone the repayment of the related party loan of $2,386,978 which will expire at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 21, 2015, Hebei Fangsheng agreed in writing to permit the Company to continue to postpone the repayment of the accrued rental charged to Orient Paper HB until the earliest date on which the Company's quarterly or annual financial statements filed with the SEC show a satisfactory working capital level. The accrued rental owned to Hebei Fangsheng was approximately $227,900 and $64,546, which was recorded in other payables and accrued liabilities as part of the current liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOn March 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with our principal shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Zhenyong Liu pursuant to which we may borrow from Mr. Liu up to RMB120,000,000 (approximately $19,611,048) for working capital purposes. The advances or funding under the agreement are due in three years from the date each amount is funded. The loan will be unsecured and carry an annual interest rate set on the basis of the primary lending rate of the People\u2019s Bank of China at the time of the borrowing.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient banking facilities or generate sufficient operating cash flow internally, the progress of the construction or renovation may be slowed down. We may also have to curtail the scope of the capital expenditure projects or to shelf some components of the projects (for example, delay the installation of PM9 until additional capital resources are available).\nOur loan-to-equity ratio was 37.05% as of December 31, 2014. Our debt-asset ratio was 27.04% as of December 31, 2014. According to a search conducted by www.chinadiaoyan.com, the industry average of debt-asset ratio was 53.06% as of September 30, 2013 for the 20 large paper mills that are publicly listed in China. Of the 20 paper mill companies publicly listed in the Chinese stock exchanges, the top 6 (ranked by total revenue) all had debt-asset ratio exceeding 60%. Aside from the short-term liquidity situation, we believe that our overall financial condition, compared to our Chinese peers, is reasonably healthy and should allow us to reasonably expand our financial debt leverage to provide capital for future growth.\nAs management believes it can secure financial resources to satisfy the Company\u2019s current liabilities and the capital expenditure needs in the next 12 months, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Should the going concern assumption not be appropriate and we are not able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities, commitments and contingencies in the normal course of operations, adjustments would be required to our consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, and these adjustments could be significant.\nIn order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our businesses through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have controlling ownership.\nWe do not have direct or indirect equity ownership of Orient Paper HB which operates a majority of our business. Although we have entered into contractual arrangements with Orient Paper HB and its individual owners pursuant to which we receive an economic interest in Orient Paper HB, and exert a controlling influence over Orient Paper HB, in a manner substantially similar to a controlling equity interest, these contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over Orient Paper HB as direct ownership. For example, Orient Paper HB may be unwilling or unable to perform their contractual obligations under our commercial agreements, including payment of consulting fees under the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement as they become due. If that were to occur, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under the contractual arrangements insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under Chinese law may be inadequate. Furthermore, Orient Paper HB may seek to renew their agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire, or to enter into similar agreements with other parties, we will lose control of Orient Paper HB.\nBecause we may rely on the consulting services agreement with Orient Paper HB for essentially most of our revenue and cash flows, any difficulty for Orient Paper HB to pay consulting fees to Orient Paper Shengde under the consulting agreement may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are a holding company and currently only conduct digital photo paper business operations under Orient Paper Shengde. As of December 31, 2014, revenue generated from digital photo paper business is approximately 2% of total revenue of Orient Paper. As a result, we may rely almost entirely for our revenues on dividend payments from Orient Paper Shengde for any payment from Orient Paper HB pursuant to the consulting services agreement which forms a part of the contractual arrangements between Orient Paper Shengde and Orient Paper HB. Since Orient Paper Shengde is not a legal shareholder of Orient Paper HB under PRC statutes, the arrangement for Orient Paper HB to pay a substantial portion of its net income to Orient Paper Shengde may be challenged by the PRC government, which could prevent us from issuing dividends to our shareholders or making required payments to some of our service providers.\nIf the PRC government determines that our agreements with these companies are not in compliance with applicable regulations, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough we believe the restructuring transaction and our current business operations are in compliance with the current laws in China, we cannot be sure that the PRC government would share the same view. If we are determined not to be in compliance, the PRC government could levy fines, revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our business, corporate structure or operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. As a result, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.\nThe shareholders of Orient Paper HB may have potential conflicts of interests with us, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate most of our businesses though Orient Paper HB. Our Chairman, Chief Exertive Officer and 25.79% shareholder, Zhenyong Liu owns 93.26% of the equity interest in Orient Paper HB. Conflicts of interests between his duties to us and to Orient Paper HB may arise. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, he will act in the best interests of our Company or that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. These conflicts may result in management decisions that could negatively affect our operations and potentially result in the loss of opportunities.\nOur arrangements with Orient Paper HB and its shareholders may be subject to a transfer pricing adjustment by the PRC tax authorities which could have an adverse effect on our income and expenses.\nWe could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our contracts with Orient Paper HB and its shareholders were not entered into based on arm\u2019s length negotiations. If the PRC tax authorities determine that these contracts were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. Such an adjustment may require that we pay additional PRC taxes plus applicable penalties and interest, if any.\nThe exercise of our option to purchase part or all of the equity interests in Orient Paper HB under the Call Option Agreement might be subject to approval by the PRC government. Our failure to obtain this approval may impair our ability to substantially control Orient Paper HB and could result in actions by Orient Paper HB that conflict with our interests.\nOur Call Option Agreement with Orient Paper HB and its shareholders gives our Chinese subsidiary, Orient Paper Shengde or its designated entity or natural person, the option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Orient Paper HB. The option may not be exercised by Orient Paper Shengde if the exercise would violate any applicable laws and regulations in China or cause any license or permit held by, and necessary for the operation of Orient Paper HB, to be cancelled or invalidated. Under the laws of China, if a foreign entity, through a foreign investment company that it invests in, acquires a domestic related company, China\u2019s regulations regarding mergers and acquisitions may technically apply to the transaction. If these regulations apply, an examination and approval of the transaction by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), or its local counterparts would be required. In addition, an appraisal of the equity interest or the assets to be acquired would also be mandatory. Since the scope of business activities (making of digital photo paper and other cultural paper products) as defined in the business license of Orient Paper Shengde does not involve the MOFCOM approval and monitoring, we do not believe at this time that an approval or an appraisal is required for Orient Paper Shengde to exercise its option to acquire Orient Paper HB. In light of the different views on this issue, however, it is possible that the central MOFCOM office in Beijing will issue a standardized opinion imposing the approval and appraisal requirement. If we are not able to purchase the equity of Orient Paper HB, then we will lose a substantial portion of our ability to control Orient Paper HB and our ability to ensure that Orient Paper HB will act in our interests.\nWe anticipate to incur significant capital expenditures in 2015.\nWe will incur significant capital expenditures in the tissue paper production line project in 2015 and possibly beyond. We have substantially increased our debt leverage to fund these projects. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $24.6 million in capital expenditure commitments that were mainly related to the construction costs of manufacturing equipment and other facilities in a new industrial park in Wei County of Hebei, China, where we will eventually build two tissue paper production lines, PM8 and PM9, and install other paper production machinery in the future. If we cannot fund or effectively manage our capital expenditures or if our capital expenditures do not lead to the results we anticipate, our business, financial position and operating performance may be materially and adversely affected. An increased debt burden may also materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and our business. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding through banking borrowings or generate sufficient operating cash flow internally, the progress of the construction or renovation may be slowed down. We may also have to curtail the scope of the capital expenditure projects or to shelf some components of the projects (for example, delay the installation of PM9 until additional capital resources are available).\nOur operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nOrient Paper HB commenced its current line of business operations in 1996 and received its initial Pollution Discharge Permit in September 1996, which must be renewed every year for Orient Paper HB to stay in business. Although we have never had problem renewing the Pollution Discharge Permit, we cannot guarantee automatic renewal every year. In addition, Orient Paper Shengde commenced its current line of business operations in 2009. Therefore, our operating history may not provide a meaningful basis on which to evaluate its business. We cannot assure you that Orient Paper HB or Orient Paper Shengde will maintain this profitability or that we will not incur net losses in the future. We expect that operating expenses of Orient Paper HB and Orient Paper Shengde will increase as they expand. Any significant failure to realize anticipated revenue growth could result in significant operating losses. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies at a similar stage of development, including our potential failure to:\n\u25cf raise adequate capital for expansion and operations;\n\u25cf implement our business model and strategy and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u25cf increase awareness of our brand name, protect our reputation and develop customer loyalty;\n\u25cf manage our expanding operations and service offerings, including the integration of any future acquisitions;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of our expenses; or\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in paper markets in which we operate as well as the impact of any changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are not successful in addressing any or all of these risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOrient Paper HB and Orient Paper Shengde\u2019s failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThrough Orient Paper HB and Orient Paper Shengde, we compete in a highly developed market with companies that have significantly greater experience and history in our industry. If we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and experience reduced selling prices, adversely affecting our financial results. Our competitors will expand in the key markets and implement new technologies making them more competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less profitable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not harm our business.\nWe might be negatively affected by the industry capacity elimination mandated by the government.\nAs described under the heading \u201cIndustry Consolidation\u201d in \u201cBusiness\u201d section, the government has been requiring outdated paper facilities to close since 2010 and is expected to continue to strictly reinforce the mandatory closure of outdated capacity in the next few years. We have continued to focus on updating our production facilities to improve the operating and energy efficiency and reduce pollution. Based on our discussions with the regulators, we believe that none of our production facilities are currently targeted for mandatory capacity reduction. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect that we would be ordered to reduce or shut down our production capacities. However, the Chinese government has broad discretion in determining the facilities subject to its production elimination mandate, and we cannot assure you that the government would not require us to shut down some or all of our production capacities. If we were forced to shut down one or more of our production facilities, our business, prospectus, financial condition and results of operations may materially and adversely affected. Depending on the scope of the government capacity elimination order, we could be forced to cease some or all of our operations.\nIf Orient Paper HB fails to comply with covenants in its loan agreements, its lenders may allege a breach of a covenant and seek to accelerate the loan or exercise other remedies, which could strain our cash flow and harm our business, liquidity and financial condition.\nOrient Paper HB received loans from commercial banks to fund its operations. Typically, these loans are made pursuant to customary loan agreements which contain representations and warranties about its business, financial covenants to which Orient Paper HB must adhere and other negative covenants in respect of its operations. Under some of these agreements, Orient Paper HB may be required to obtain the consent of its lenders prior to entering into its contractual arrangement with us but Orient Paper HB did not receive such prior consent. To date, our lenders have not given us any notice of default or otherwise objected to our contractual arrangements with Orient Paper HB. If any lender raises any concern in this regard, we intend to secure a waiver from our lenders, but cannot assure you that we will successfully do so. If we cannot obtain such a wavier and Orient Paper HB\u2019s lenders declare it to be in default under the loan agreements, they may accelerate Orient Paper HB\u2019s indebtedness to them which would negatively affect our cash flows and business operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth.\nIf our business and markets grow and develop, it will be necessary for us to finance and manage expansion in an orderly fashion. An expansion would increase demands on existing management, workforce and facilities. Failure to satisfy such increased demands could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause delay in production and delivery of our paper products, as well as administrative inefficiencies.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, may review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement the current product offerings of Orient Paper HB, augment its market coverage or enhance its technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. From time to time we review investments in new businesses and we, through our subsidiaries, expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products, or technologies in the future. We expect that when we raise funds from investors for any of these purposes we will be either the issuer or the primary obligor while the proceeds will be forwarded to Orient Paper HB. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u25cf issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf incur substantial debt;\n\u25cf assume contingent liabilities; or\n\u25cf expend significant cash.\nThese actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits. Acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies and/or products;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering markets in which Orient Paper HB has no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations; and\n\u25cf substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technology, or personnel that we might acquire in the future and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our and/or Orient Paper HB\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nOur Articles of Incorporation provides for the indemnification and/or exculpation of our directors, officers, employees, agents and other entities which deal with us to the maximum extent provided, and under the terms provided, by the laws and decisions of the courts of the state of Nevada. Although we do maintain professional error and omission insurance for the officers and directors, due to limitations of the insurance coverage these indemnification provisions could still result in substantial expenditures which we may be unable to recoup through the insurance and could adversely affect our business and financial conditions. Zhenyong Liu, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Jing Hao, our Chief Financial Officer, Dahong Zhou, our Secretary, and Marco Ku Hon Wai, Wenbing Christopher Wang, Zhaofang Wang, and Fuzeng Liu, our directors, are key personnel with rights to indemnification under our Articles of Incorporation.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and paper factory operational expertise of key personnel. Zhenyong Liu, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Jing Hao, our Chief Financial Officer, Dahong Zhou, our Secretary, and Shuting Liang, Orient Paper HB\u2019s General Engineer, Gengqi Yang, Orient Paper HB\u2019s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Fulai Huang, Orient Paper HB\u2019s Vice President of Environmental Protection and Xiaodong Liu, Orient Paper Shengde\u2019s General Manager, perform key functions in the operation of our business. There can be no assurance that Orient Paper or Orient Paper HB or Orient Paper Shengde will be able to retain these officers after the term of their employment contracts expire. The loss of these officers could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not carry key man life insurance for any of our key personnel or personnel nor do we foresee purchasing such insurance to protect against a loss of key personnel and personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the services of Mr. Zhenyong Liu for the continued growth and operation of our Company because of his experience in the industry and his personal and business contacts in the PRC. Although Mr. Liu has entered into an employment agreement with Orient Paper Shengde, our wholly owned subsidiary and a PRC company, and that we have no reason to believe that Mr. Liu will discontinue his services with us or Orient Paper HB, the interruption or loss of his services would adversely affect our ability to effectively run our business and pursue our business strategy as well as our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to support our growth and if we are unable to retain or hire these personnel in the future, our ability to improve our products and implement our business objectives could be adversely affected.\nWe must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees. Competition for senior management and senior personnel in the PRC is intense, the pool of qualified candidates in the PRC is very limited, and we may not be able to retain the services of our senior executives or senior personnel, or attract and retain high-quality senior executives or senior personnel in the future. This failure could materially and adversely affect our future growth and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the costs of paper products and development;\n\u25cf the relative speed and success with which we can obtain and maintain customers, merchants and vendors for our products;\n\u25cf capital expenditure for equipment;\n\u25cf marketing and promotional activities and other costs;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies, suppliers and competitors;\n\u25cf the ability of our suppliers to provide products in a timely manner to their customers;\n\u25cf changes in operating expenses;\n\u25cf increased competition in the paper markets; and\n\u25cf other general economic and seasonal factors.\nWe face risks related to product liability claims.\nWe presently do not maintain product liability insurance. We face the risk of loss because of adverse publicity associated with product liability lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. We may not be able to avoid such claims. Although product liability lawsuits in the PRC are rare, and we have not, to date, experienced significant failure of our products, there is no guarantee that we will not face such liability in the future. This liability could be substantial and the occurrence of such loss or liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur operating results also depend on the availability and pricing of energy and raw materials.\nIn addition to our dependence upon wood pulp, recycled white scrap paper and paperboard costs, our operating results depend on the availability and pricing of energy and other raw materials, including chemical agents and coal. An interruption in the supply of supplemental chemical agents could cause a material disruption at our mill. In addition, an interruption in the supply of coal could cause a material disruption at our facilities. At present, our raw materials including coal are purchased from a number of suppliers, of which the three largest suppliers account for over 80% of all purchases. If any of these contracts were to be terminated for any reason, or not renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions were to substantially change creating a significant increase in the price of coal and recycled paper, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of providing coal to us on terms or in amounts satisfactory to us. As a result of any of these events, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our net income.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u25cf maintenance outages;\n\u25cf prolonged power failures;\n\u25cf an equipment failure, including any malfunction of our waste water treatment facilities;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of raw materials, such as wood fiber, energy, or chemicals;\n\u25cf a chemical spill or release;\n\u25cf closure because of environmental-related concerns;\n\u25cf explosion of a boiler;\n\u25cf the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on our water supply;\n\u25cf disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and tunnels;\n\u25cf fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophes;\n\u25cf terrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\u25cf labor difficulties; or\n\u25cf other operational problems.\nWe have purchased property base insurance from China Pacific Property Insurance Co., Ltd., valid from August 2014 through August 2015. However, if any of the above mentioned events were to occur, we may be unable to meet customer demand, which may adversely affect our sales and net income.\nOur certificates, permits, and licenses related to our papermaking operations are subject to governmental control and renewal and failure to obtain renewal will cause all or part of our operations to be terminated.\nIn 1988, the National Environmental Protection Bureau issued Interim Measures on the Administration of Water Pollutants Discharge Permits, requiring all companies discharging pollution into the water as a direct or indirect byproduct of production to adhere to certain caps on pollution discharge. Additionally, such companies were required to obtain and annually renew a Pollution Discharge Permit in order to conduct their operations. The PRC government has the authority to shut down a company\u2019s operations for failure to maintain a valid permit. We renewed our Pollution Discharge Permit in January 2015. Our latest permit is effective from February 15, 2015 through February 14, 2016. An application to renew will be filed with the local environment protection agency before the expiration.\nThe failure by us to obtain any certificate, permit, and license necessary for our operations or failure by us to obtain the renewal of any such certificate, permit or license may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nCompliance with environmental regulations is expensive, and noncompliance may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspension of our business operations.\nWe are required to comply with all Chinese national and local regulations regarding the protection of the environment. Compliance with environmental regulation is expensive. The Chinese government is adopting even more stringent environmental protection and operational safety regulations and the costs of complying with these regulations are expected to increase. Although we have obtained all of the necessary approvals and permits for our production facilities currently existing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all applicable environmental protection and operational safety requirements, and obtain all of the required governmental approvals and permits that may be or may become applicable to us on a timely basis, or at all, or will be able to complete all our registrations and filings with the government, in time for our future projects. The relevant governmental authorities may impose on us fines for any non-compliance, set deadlines for rectification, and order us to cease construction or production if we fail to comply with their requirements.\nIf we are unable to respond to pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, from time to time we have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have available sufficient financial or other resources to continue to make investments necessary to maintain our competitive position.\nIf we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to develop new products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demand. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that make our existing products obsolete, could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and as such, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. On May 24, 2013, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Chinese securities regulators that would enable the PCAOB under certain circumstances to obtain audit work papers of China-based audit firms. The MOU establishes a framework under which the PCAOB can request and obtain audit papers and permits the PCAOB to share the work papers it obtains with the SEC, subject to certain requirements. But the MOU, which is non-binding, is also limited by its own terms. For instance, Chinese regulators may refuse to produce documents in specified circumstances, including where production would violate Chinese law or run contrary to the public interest. Moreover, the MOU does not provide the PCAOB with the ability to conduct on-the-ground inspections of auditors in China, an important part of the Board\u2019s oversight function. As a result, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by PCAOB in the same way that PCAOB requests independent registered public accounting firms operating outside China. Inspections of other firms that PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of PCAOB to conduct regular inspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB regular inspections.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions.\nAs the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, insurance companies in China currently offer limited business insurance products. We do not have any product liability insurance or business interruption insurance. Based on the insurance products available in China, even if we decide to take out business interruption coverage, such insurance as currently available offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other jurisdictions. Any business disruption, natural disaster, or product liability claim could result in our incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related To Doing Business in the PRC\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The PRC has operated as a socialist state since the middle of the 20th century and is controlled by the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. The PRC has only permitted provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities since 1978. The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy, including the paper industry, through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under its current leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nA change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social life.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations may harm our business.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. The PRC\u2019s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes, in which system decided legal cases have little value as precedents unlike the common law system prevalent in the United States. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business, the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements with our affiliated Chinese entity, Orient Paper HB, and its shareholders, or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy and criminal proceedings. The Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws, and considerable progress has been made in introducing laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. However, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. Our major operating entity, Orient Paper HB, conducts its operations in China, and as a result, we are required to comply with PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business. If the relevant authorities find that we are in violation of PRC laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf levying fines;\n\u25cf revoking Orient Paper HB\u2019s business and other licenses;\n\u25cf requiring that we restructure our ownership or operations; and\n\u25cf requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business.\nAmong the material laws that we are subject to are the Price Law of The People\u2019s Republic of China, Measurement Law of The People\u2019s Republic of China, Tax Law, Environmental Protection Law, Contract Law, Patent Law, Accounting Laws and Labor Law.\nA slowdown, inflation or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and products.\nAll of our operations are conducted in the PRC and all of our revenue is generated from sales in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, we cannot assure you that this growth will continue. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our products and harm our business.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth could lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may harm our profitability. In order to control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credit, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. Such an austere policy can lead to a slowing of economic growth.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. We receive substantially all of our revenue in Renminbi, which is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe PRC government may also in the future restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may harm your investment.\t\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. According to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, as of December 31, 2014, $1 is converted into 6.1190 Yuan (RMB). As we rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC, any significant revaluation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into Renminbi for Orient Paper HB\u2019s operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would diminish the value of the proceeds of the offering and this could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations because it would reduce the proceeds available to us for capital investment in proportion to the appreciation of the Renminbi. Thus if we raise 1,000,000 dollars and the Renminbi appreciates against the U.S. dollar by 15%, then the proceeds will be worth only RMB 5,201,150 as opposed to RMB 6,119,000 prior to the appreciation. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common shares or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Renminbi, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Renminbi we convert would be reduced in proportion to the amount the U.S. dollar appreciates. In addition, the depreciation of significant RMB denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the dollar value of these assets. Thus if Orient Paper HB has RMB1,000,000 in assets and Renminbi is depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 15%, then the assets will be valued at $142,109 as opposed to $163,425 prior to the depreciation.\nOn July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximately 35.01% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2014. While the international reaction to the Renminbi revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may materially adversely affect us.\nIn October 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Round-Trip Investment Through Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75. The policy announced in this notice required PRC residents to register with the relevant SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company, or SPV, for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents. Internal implementing guidelines issued by SAFE, which became public in May 2007 (known as Notice 106), expanded the reach of Circular 75. In the case of an SPV which was established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the implementation date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required to have been completed before March 31, 2006; this date was subsequently extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the SPV and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements of Circular 75, as applied by SAFE in accordance with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also result in the SPV\u2019s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out of China.\nBecause of uncertainty over the interpretation of Circular 75, we cannot assure you that, if challenged by government agencies, the structure of our organization has fully complied with all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. A failure by such PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply with Circular 75 and Notice 106, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal and judicial system may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors.\nThe PRC legal and judicial system may negatively impact foreign investors. In 1982, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Constitution of China to authorize foreign investment and guarantee the \u201clawful rights and interests\u201d of foreign investors in the PRC. However, the PRC\u2019s system of laws is not yet comprehensive. The legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is inconsistent. Many judges in the PRC lack the depth of legal training and experience that would be expected of a judge in a more developed country. Because the PRC judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing the laws that do exist, anticipation of judicial decision-making is more uncertain than would be expected in a more developed country. It may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on the civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes; a decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes.\nThe trend of legislation over the last 20 years has significantly enhanced the protection of foreign investment and allowed for more control by foreign parties of their investments in Chinese enterprises. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. A change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic or social life, may affect the PRC government\u2019s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe practical effect of the PRC legal system on our business operations in the PRC can be viewed from two separate but intertwined considerations. First, as a matter of substantive law, the foreign invested enterprise laws provide significant protection from government interference. In addition, these laws guarantee the full enjoyment of the benefits of corporate articles and contracts to foreign invested enterprise participants. These laws, however, do impose standards concerning corporate formation and governance, which are qualitatively different from the general corporation laws of the United States. Similarly, the PRC accounting laws mandate accounting practices, which are not consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. PRC\u2019s accounting laws require that an annual \u201cstatutory audit\u201d be performed in accordance with PRC accounting standards and that the books of account of foreign invested enterprises are maintained in accordance with Chinese accounting laws. Article 14 of the People\u2019s Republic of China Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law requires a wholly foreign-owned enterprise to submit certain periodic fiscal reports and statements to designated financial and tax authorities, at the risk of business license revocation. While the enforcement of substantive rights may appear less clear than United States procedures, foreign invested enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises are Chinese registered companies, which enjoy the same status as other Chinese registered companies in business-to-business dispute resolution. Any award rendered by an arbitration tribunal is enforceable in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). Therefore, as a practical matter, although no assurances can be given, the Chinese legal infrastructure, while different in operation from its United States counterpart, should not present any significant impediment to the operation of foreign invested enterprises.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and most of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers or to enforce U.S. court judgment against us or them in the PRC.\nMost of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States. In addition, our operating company is located in the PRC and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties, under the U.S. Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nWe may be required to broaden the coverage of the mandatory social security insurance programs under the New Labor Law of the PRC.\nThe PRC New Labor Law, effective January 1, 2008, requires that employers enroll in the following social security insurance programs and offer certain employer-sponsored premium benefits to eligible employees: (1) retirement endowment, (2) healthcare insurance, (3) unemployment insurance, (4) workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and (5) pregnancy insurance. Of these insurance programs, the retirement endowment fund requires employee withholdings of 4% to 8% of the gross compensation, while the employer\u2019s matching contribution varies from 16% to 20% of such compensation. While the Company is enrolled in the retirement endowment fund and is withholding employees\u2019 portion and the employer\u2019s portion of the endowment contribution, many of the Company\u2019s employees have elected to waive their coverage under these mandatory social security insurance programs in favor of certain other low-cost, local government-sponsored social security insurance programs for residents in non-urban districts. Although we have verified with the local government agencies for the validity of the employee waivers and reasonably believe that we are not required to cover the employees who waived the benefits, the local government may change its policy and ask us to broaden our insurance coverage to those who have specifically waived their rights.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur officers and directors control us through their positions and stock ownership and their interests may differ from other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 20,316,400 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Mr. Zhenyong Liu, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 25.79% of our common stock. As a result, he is able to influence the outcome of stockholder votes on various matters, including the election of directors and extraordinary corporate transactions including business combinations. Yet Mr. Liu\u2019s interests may differ from those of other stockholders. Furthermore, ownership of 25.79% of our common stock by Mr. Liu reduces the public float and liquidity, and may affect the market price, of our common stock as traded on the NYSE MKT.\nWe may not continue to pay cash dividends and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWhile we intend to retain the majority of any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, we did declare four quarterly cash dividends in April 2012 and November 2013. Although it is likely that our Board of Directors will continue the quarterly cash dividend as a regular dividend policy in the coming years, there is no guarantee that the cash dividend will not be discontinued or reduced. Should we decide to continue the cash dividend, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.\nIf we fail to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of U.S. public companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. While we have not detected any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control and with respect to the assessment of the internal control for the year ended December 31, 2014, we cannot guarantee the implementation of controls and procedures in future years to be without any significant deficiency or material weakness.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT. Although a trading market has developed for our common stock, there can be no assurance that the trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Failure to maintain a trading market for our common stock may adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or at all. Our common stock has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture financings may dilute stockholders or impair our financial condition.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, which might include the sale of equity securities. The issuance of equity securities could result in financial and voting dilution to our existing stockholders. The issuance of debt could result in effective subordination of stockholders\u2019 interests to the debt, create the possibility of default, and limit our financial and business alternatives.", "PERMNO": 93177, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "ITP"}
