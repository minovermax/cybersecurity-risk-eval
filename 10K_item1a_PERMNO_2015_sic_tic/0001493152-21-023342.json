Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this filing before deciding to purchase our common stock. If any of these risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. We believe that this filing contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to facts that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. See Item 1. Description of Business - \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d\nWe have no operations and minimal assets, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to return any additional value to our stockholders.\nOn November 25, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cMCPP\u201d) for the sale of substantially all of our assets for a total purchase price of $7,250,000 (the \u201cAsset Sale\u201d). The Asset Purchase Agreement was approved by our stockholders on January 21, 2020. As a result, we ceased operating as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d). Subsequent to the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. Although certain opportunities have been investigated to determine whether a potential merger or investment opportunity could add value for the benefit of our shareholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts. If we are not successful, our management and the board of directors may determine it to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to liquidate the Company and terminate our existence, which would result in a complete loss in the value of our common stock.\nWe have no active market for our shares.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale and cessation of operations as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers, the we believe the costs associated with continued listing on the QB Tier of the OTC Markets outweigh the benefits of remaining on the QB Tier. Accordingly, in July 2020, we notified the OTC Markets of our intent to be delisted from the QB Tier and to be listed on the OTC Markets Pink Tier. Effective August 1, 2020, our shares were listed on the OTC Markets Pink Tier. Notwithstanding our voluntary request for delisting to the OTC Pink Tier of the OTC Markets, we will use our best efforts and available resources to remain in compliance with the reporting requirements set forth for QB Tier company, however, there can be no assurances that we will have the financial or human resources necessary to file timely reports, if filed at all, with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the regulatory requirements of the Securities Acts of 1933 or 1934.\nWe may be subject to the applicability of low-priced stock risk disclosure requirements.\nOur common stock may be considered a low priced security under rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describe the risks associated with such stocks, the broker-dealer\u2019s duties, the customer\u2019s rights and remedies, certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the customer for low priced stock transactions based on the customer\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing to the customer, obtain specific written consent of the customer, and provide monthly account statements to the customer. With all these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low priced stock will be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for the stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and to increase the transaction cost of sales and purchases of such stock compared to other securities.\nAdditional authorized shares of our common stock and preferred stock available for issuance may adversely affect the market.\nWe are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2021, there were 28,339,063 shares of our common stock issued and 28,262,371 shares of our common stock outstanding. As of March 31, 2021, there were 76,692 shares of treasury stock which were acquired prior to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. All shares underlying vested options and warrants granted prior to March 31, 2021 have been exercised, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 6,771,750 shares of our common stock, and are included in the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, we had 160,000 shares of outstanding stock options pursuant to the 2003 Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2003 Plan\u201d) and 450,000 shares of outstanding stock options pursuant to our 2017 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2017 Plan\u201d) available for grant. Effective April 30, 2020, the 160,000 shares of outstanding stock options pursuant to the 2003 Plan were forfeited. If the remaining options pursuant to the 2017 Plan are granted, our stockholders will also experience dilution upon the exercise of future option grants. In addition, in the event that any future financing, acquisition, or consideration for services rendered should be in the form of, be convertible into or exchangeable for, equity securities, investors will experience additional dilution.\nThe exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants will reduce the percentage of common stock held by our current stockholders. Further, the terms on which we could obtain additional capital during the life of the stock options and warrants may be adversely affected, and it should be expected that the holders of the stock options and warrants would exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain equity capital on terms more favorable than those provided for by such stock options and warrants. As a result, any issuance of additional shares of common stock may cause our current stockholders to suffer significant dilution which may adversely affect the market. In addition to the above referenced shares of common stock which may be issued without stockholder approval, we have 5,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, the terms of which may be fixed by our Board, of which 500,000 preferred shares were previously issued, but none are currently outstanding. While we have no present plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock, our Board has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock. The issuance of any of such series of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied a one year holding period may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by our stockholders that are non-affiliates that have satisfied a two year holding period. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.", "PERMNO": 83592, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "ASNB"}
