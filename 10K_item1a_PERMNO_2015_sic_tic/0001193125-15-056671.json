{"cik": "853816", "company": "LANDSTAR SYSTEM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIncreased severity or frequency of accidents and other claims. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Self-Insured Claims,\u201d potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim, $250,000 for each workers\u2019 compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Company\u2019s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material\nincrease in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers\u2019 compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstar\u2019s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations.\nDependence on third party insurance companies. The Company is dependent on a limited number of third party insurance companies to provide insurance coverage in excess of its self-insured retention amounts. Historically, the Company has maintained insurance coverage for commercial trucking claims in excess of specific per occurrence limits, up to various maximum amounts, with a limited number of third party insurance companies. In an attempt to manage the cost of insurance and claims, the Company has historically increased or decreased the level of its financial exposure to commercial trucking claims on a per occurrence basis by increasing or decreasing its level of self-insured retention based on the estimated cost differential between proposed premiums from third party insurance companies and historical losses experienced by the Company at various levels of self-insured retention. To the extent that the third party insurance companies propose increases to their premiums for coverage of commercial trucking claims, the Company may pay such increased premiums or increase its financial exposure on an aggregate or per occurrence basis, including by increasing the amount of its self-insured retention. However, to the extent the third party insurance companies propose reduced premiums for coverage of commercial trucking claims, the Company may reduce its financial exposure on an aggregate or per occurrence basis, including by decreasing the amount of its self-insured retention. In addition, no assurance can be given that insurance coverage from third party insurers for claims in excess of its current $5 million self-insured retention will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nDependence on independent commission sales agents. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Agent Network,\u201d the Company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents. During 2014, 525 agents generated revenue for Landstar of at least $1 million each (the \u201cMillion Dollar Agents\u201d), or approximately 92% of Landstar\u2019s consolidated revenue. Landstar competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of these independent commission sales agents. Landstar has historically experienced very limited agent turnover in the number of its Million Dollar Agents. There can be no assurances, however, that Landstar will continue to experience very limited turnover of its Million Dollar Agents in the future. Landstar\u2019s contracts with its agents, including its Million Dollar Agents, are typically terminable without cause upon 10 to 30 days\u2019 notice by either party and generally contain significant but not unqualified non-compete provisions limiting the ability of a former agent to compete with Landstar for a specified period of time post- termination, and other restrictive covenants. The loss of some of the Company\u2019s Million Dollar Agents and/or a significant decrease in revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and revenue.\nDependence on third party capacity providers. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Transportation Capacity,\u201d Landstar does not own trucks or other transportation equipment (other than trailing equipment) and relies on third party capacity providers, including BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers, to transport freight for its customers. The Company competes with motor carriers and other third parties for the services of BCO Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers. The market for qualified truck owner-operators and other third party truck capacity providers is very competitive among motor carriers and no assurances can be given that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the number of BCO Independent Contractors or other third party truck capacity providers. Additionally, the Company\u2019s third party capacity providers other than BCO Independent Contractors can be expected, under certain circumstances, to charge higher prices to cover increased operating expenses, such as any increases in the cost of fuel, and the Company\u2019s operating income may decline without a corresponding increase in price to the customer. A significant decrease in available capacity provided by either the Company\u2019s BCO Independent Contractors or other third party capacity providers, or increased rates charged by other third party capacity providers that cannot be passed through to the customers, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and revenue.\nDecreased demand for transportation services. The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical financial results as a result of slowdowns in economic activity, the business cycles of customers, and\nother economic factors beyond Landstar\u2019s control. If a slowdown in economic activity or a downturn in the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business cycles cause a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, the Company\u2019s operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nSubstantial industry competition. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Competition,\u201d Landstar competes primarily in the transportation and logistics services industry. This industry is extremely competitive and fragmented. Landstar competes primarily with truckload carriers, intermodal transportation service providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, third party logistics companies and other asset-light transportation and logistics service providers. Management believes that competition for the freight transported by the Company is based on service, efficiency and freight rates, which are influenced significantly by the economic environment, particularly the amount of available transportation capacity and freight demand. Historically, competition has created downward pressure on freight rates. In addition, many large shippers are using third party logistics providers (\u201c3PLs\u201d) other than the Company to outsource the management and coordination of their transportation needs rather than directly arranging for transportation services with carriers. As noted above, there were 10 transportation service providers, including 3PLs, included in the Company\u2019s top 25 customers for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014. Usage by large shippers of 3PLs often provides carriers, such as the Company, with a less direct relationship with the shipper and, as a result, may increase pressure on freight rates while making it more difficult for the Company to compete primarily based on service and efficiency. A decrease in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its revenue and operating income.\nStatus of independent contractors. From time to time, various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors\u2019 classification to employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees. Currently, most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on a multi-factor \u201ccommon-law\u201d analysis rather than any definition found in the Internal Revenue Code or Internal Revenue Service regulations. In addition, under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, a taxpayer that meets certain criteria may treat an individual as an independent contractor for employment tax purposes if the taxpayer has been audited without being told to treat similarly situated workers as employees, if the taxpayer has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or a court decision affirming the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of the individual as an independent contractor, or if the taxpayer is following a long-standing recognized practice.\nThe Company classifies its BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax and employee benefits. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the employee/independent contractor classification of BCO Independent Contractors or independent commission sales agents doing business with the Company. Although management believes that there are no proposals currently pending that would significantly change the employee/independent contractor classification of BCO Independent Contractors or independent commission sales agents currently doing business with the Company, potential changes, if any, with respect to these BCO Independent Contractor and independent commission sales agent classifications could have a material adverse effect on Landstar\u2019s operating model. Moreover, the costs associated with any such potential changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition if Landstar were unable to pass through to its customers an increase in price corresponding to such increased costs.\nRegulatory and legislative changes. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Regulation,\u201d certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are motor carriers and/or property brokers authorized to arrange for transportation services by motor carriers which are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and by various state agencies. Certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are licensed as ocean transportation intermediaries by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission as non-vessel-operating common carriers and/or as ocean freight\nforwarders. The Company\u2019s air transportation activities in the United States are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. One of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries is licensed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cU.S. Customs\u201d) as a customs broker. The Company is also subject to regulations and requirements relating to safety and security promulgated by, among others, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through U.S. Customs and the Transportation Security Administration, the Canada Border Services Agency and various state and local agencies and port authorities. The transportation industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes (such as increasingly stringent environmental, climate change and/or safety/security regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size) that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services.\nIn particular, the FMCSA is consistently proposing regulatory changes that affect the operation of commercial motor carriers across the United States. The FMSCA has established the Compliance Safety Accountability (CSA) motor carrier oversight program. The Company believes the intent of this program is to improve regulatory oversight of motor carriers and commercial drivers using a safety measurement system methodology that is fundamentally different from the methodology that the FMCSA has historically relied upon. Under CSA, the FMCSA monitors seven Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or BASICs, under which a motor carrier may be evaluated. Since the introduction of CSA in December 2010, the FMCSA has considered and implemented changes to the methodologies used to determine carrier scores within a BASIC as well as to the BASICs, themselves. The FMCSA has also established threshold scores for each BASIC. In the event a motor carrier has one or more BASIC scores that exceeds the applicable threshold, the motor carrier has an increased risk of audit by FMSCA. BASIC scores in excess of applicable thresholds may also adversely affect a motor carrier\u2019s overall safety rating and its relationships with shippers. The FMSCA has also recently implemented changes to the hours of service regulations which govern the work hours of commercial drivers and has a number of other proposals that it has announced are in process, including a rule which may mandate the use of electronic logging devices in over-the-road commercial motor vehicles. It is difficult to predict which and in what form CSA or any other FMCSA regulations may be implemented, modified or enforced and what impact any such regulation may have on motor carrier operations or the aggregate number of trucks that provide hauling capacity to the Company.\nIn addition, recent focus on climate change and related environmental matters has led to efforts by federal, state and local governmental agencies to support legislation and regulations to limit the amount of carbon emissions, including emissions created by diesel engines utilized in tractors operated by the Company\u2019s BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers. Moreover, federal, state and local governmental agencies may also focus on regulation in relation to trailing equipment specifications in an effort to achieve, among other things, lower carbon emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) has implemented regulations that restrict the ability of certain tractors and trailers from operating in California. The Company currently is in a multi-year process of replacing its entire fleet of van trailing equipment to remain CARB-compliant. Further, CARB has established regulations that impose emission standards on nearly all diesel-fueled trucks with gross vehicle weight ratings in excess of 14,000 lbs. that operate in California. No assurances can be given with respect to the extent BCO Independent Contractors will choose to become CARB-compliant by purchasing a new or used CARB-compliant tractor, replacing the engine in their existing tractor with a CARB-compliant engine or performing an exhaust retrofit of their existing tractor by installing a particulate matter filter. Accordingly, many of the Company\u2019s BCO Independent Contractors may choose not to haul loads that would require travel within California, which could affect the ability of the Company to service customer freight needs for freight originating from, delivering to or traveling through California. Moreover, increased regulation on tractor or trailing equipment specifications, including emissions created by diesel engines, could create substantial costs on the Company and the Company\u2019s third party capacity providers and, in turn, increase the cost of purchased transportation to the Company. An increase in the costs to purchase, lease or maintain tractor or trailing equipment or in purchased transportation cost caused by new regulations without a corresponding increase in price to the customer could adversely affect Landstar, including its results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions or failures in the Company\u2019s computer systems. As noted above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Factors Significant to the Company\u2019s Operations - Technology,\u201d the Company\u2019s information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and to a lesser extent in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, the Company utilizes several third party data centers throughout the U.S. Landstar relies in the regular course of its business on the proper operation of its information technology systems to link its extensive network of customers, agents and third party capacity providers, including its BCO Independent Contractors. Although the Company has redundant systems for its critical operations, any significant disruption or failure of its technology systems or those of third party data centers on which it relies could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and impose significant costs on the Company.\nDependence on key vendors. As described above under \u201cDependence on third party insurance companies\u201d and \u201cDisruptions or failures in the Company\u2019s computer systems,\u201d the Company is dependent on certain vendors, including third party insurance companies, third party data center providers, third party information technology application providers and third party payment disbursement providers. Any inability to negotiate satisfactory terms with one of these key vendors or any other significant disruption to or termination of a relationship with one of these key vendors could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and impose significant costs on the Company.\nPotential changes in fuel taxes. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels. The Company cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to the transportation services provided by the Company will be enacted and, if enacted, whether or not the Company\u2019s Truck Brokerage Carriers would attempt to pass the increase on to the Company or if the Company will be able to reflect this potential increased cost of capacity, if any, in prices to customers. Any such increase in fuel taxes, without a corresponding increase in price to the customer, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar, including its results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, competition from other transportation service companies including those that provide non-trucking modes of transportation and intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal taxes on fuel were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation.\nCatastrophic loss of a Company facility. The Company faces the risk of a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of its facilities located in Jacksonville, Florida and Rockford, Illinois due to hurricanes, flooding, tornados, other weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or otherwise. The Company\u2019s corporate headquarters and approximately two-thirds of the Company\u2019s employees are located in its Jacksonville, Florida facility. In particular, a significant hurricane or similar catastrophic event that impacts the Jacksonville, Florida metropolitan area could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and impose significant costs on the Company.\nAlthough the Company maintains insurance covering its facilities, including business interruption insurance, the Company\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred in the event of a catastrophic loss of one of the Company\u2019s facilities. In addition, such insurance, including business interruption insurance, could in the future become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIntellectual property. The Company uses both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting its business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the use of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against the Company by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against the Company either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and its results of operations.\nUnclaimed property. The Company is subject to federal and state laws relating to abandoned and unclaimed property. States routinely audit the records of companies to assess compliance with such laws. The\nCompany is currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted. The Company may incur significant professional fees in connection with the audit. If the Company is found to be in noncompliance with applicable unclaimed property laws or the manner in which such laws are interpreted or applied, states may determine that they are entitled to the remittance by the Company of significant amounts of unclaimed or abandoned property and further may seek to impose other significant costs on the Company, including penalties and interest.", "PERMNO": 78981, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "LSTR"}
