{"cik": "1169988", "company": "BOINGO WIRELESS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report on Form 10-K, including our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our relationships with our venue and network partners, and if these relationships are impaired or terminated, or if our partners do not perform as expected, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on our relationships with venue partners, particularly key airport venue partners, in order to manage and operate DAS networks and Wi-Fi hotspots. These relationships generate a significant portion of our revenue and allow us to generate wholesale revenues and new retail and military customers. Our agreements with our venue partners, DAS telecom operators, and wholesale Wi-Fi customers are for defined periods and of varying durations. In order to maintain our relationships with venue partners, we may need to upgrade our networks, which would require significantly higher initial capital expenditures than we have historically incurred, and if we are unsuccessful, our relationships could be impaired. If our venue partners terminate or fail to renew these agreements, our ability to generate and retain wholesale, retail and military customers would be diminished and our network of DAS networks and Wi-Fi hotspots would be reduced, which might result in a significant disruption of our business and adversely affect our operating results. Further, any\ndelays in our ability to complete the upgrade of our networks or build-out new networks can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on our relationships with network partners to allow users to roam across Wi-Fi networks that we do not manage or operate. A significant portion of our revenue depends on maintaining these relationships with network partners. Some network partners may compete with us for retail customers and may decide to terminate our partnerships and instead develop competing retail products and services. Our network partner agreements are for defined periods and of varying durations. If our network partners terminate these agreements, or fail to renew these agreements, our ability to retain retail customers could be diminished and our network of Wi-Fi hotspots could be reduced, which could result in a significant disruption of our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nWorldwide economic conditions, and their impact on travel and consumer spending, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions have been weak for a prolonged period of time, and levels of travel and consumer spending have been particularly depressed. Our business is impacted by travel and consumer spending, because users seek to access the mobile Internet while they are on-the-go, and because spending on Internet access is often a consumer discretionary spending decision. Factors that tend to negatively impact levels of travel include high unemployment, high energy prices, low business and consumer confidence, the fear of terrorist attacks, war and other macroeconomic factors. Economic conditions that tend to negatively impact levels of discretionary consumer spending include high unemployment, high consumer debt, reductions in net worth, depressed real estate markets, increased taxation, high energy prices, high interest rates, low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. If the global economic recovery is slower than expected, or if it weakens, our retail and military customer base, new retail and military customer acquisition and usage-based revenue could be materially harmed, and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business depends upon demand for mobile Internet services on Wi-Fi networks, market adoption of new technologies and our ability to adapt to such changes.\nOur future success depends upon growing demand for mobile Internet services, which is inherently uncertain. The demand for mobile Internet services may decrease or may grow more slowly than expected. Any such decrease in the demand or slowing rate of growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. The continued demand for mobile Internet services depends on the continued proliferation of smartphones, tablet computers and other Wi-Fi enabled devices and the rate of evolution of data-intensive applications on the mobile Internet. Historically, we have derived substantially all our retail revenue from laptop users who purchased month-to-month subscriptions or single-use access. We may face challenges as we seek to increase the revenue generated from the usage on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices.\nOur business depends on the continued integration of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in mobile devices. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in mobile devices, or if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on mobile devices decreases or is slower than expected, the market for our services may be substantially diminished.\nCompeting technologies pose a risk to the continued use of Wi-Fi as a mobile Internet technology. The introduction and market acceptance of emerging wireless technologies such as 4G, WiMAX and Super Wi-Fi, could cause significant disruption to our business, which may result in a loss of customers, users and revenue. If users find emerging wireless technologies to be sufficiently fast, convenient or cost effective, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to attract or retain users will be impaired. Additionally, one or more of our partners may deploy emerging wireless technologies that\ncould reduce the partner's need to work with us, and may result in significant loss of revenue and reduction of the hotspots in our network.\nWe deliver value to our users by providing simple access to Wi-Fi hotspots, regardless of whether we manage and operate the hotspot, or the hotspot is operated by a partner. As a result, our business depends on our ability to anticipate and quickly adapt to changing technological standards and advances. If technological standards change and we fail to adapt accordingly, our business and revenue may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices and operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create simple solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business will be adversely affected.\nThe growth of free Wi-Fi networks may compete with our paid mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions.\nMany venues, including airports, coffee shops and hotels, offer free mobile Wi-Fi as an incentive or value-added benefit to their customers. Free Wi-Fi may reduce retail customer demand for our services, and put downward pressure on the prices we charge our retail customers. In addition, telecom operators may offer free mobile Wi-Fi as part of a home broadband or other service contract, which also may force down the prices we charge our retail customers. If we are unable to effectively offset this downward pressure on our prices by being a Wi-Fi service provider, or if we are unable to acquire and retain retail customers, we will have lower profit margins and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nNegotiations with prospective wholesale partners can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our operating results to vary.\nOur negotiations with prospective partners to acquire Wi-Fi hotspots to operate, to acquire roaming rights on partners' networks, or for new partners to implement our solutions, can be lengthy, and in some cases can last over 12 months. Because of the lengthy negotiation cycle, the time required to reach a final agreement with a partner is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. Negotiations with prospective partners also require substantial time, effort and resources. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations, resulting in costs to our business without any associated benefits.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding into new venue types, which could harm the growth of our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are negotiating with existing and prospective partners to expand our managed and operated Wi-Fi network footprint in venue types where we historically have had only a limited presence. Expansion into these venue types, and in particular shopping malls, stadiums, hospitals and quick service restaurants, may require significantly higher initial capital expenditures than we have historically incurred. In contrast to Wi-Fi network build-outs at venues such as airports, where telecom operators typically pay the substantial expense of laying cable or fiber, we may be required to incur the initial capital expense of access points and related hardware and cabling at tens of thousands of quick serve restaurant locations and hundreds of shopping malls, hospitals and stadium locations. We may not be able to execute on our strategy or there may not be returns on these investments in the near future or at all. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate relatively new businesses in an emerging market, so an investment in our company involves more risk than an investment in a more mature company in an established industry.\nWe derive nearly all of our revenue from mobile Internet services, which are new and highly dynamic businesses, which face significant challenges. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties we will encounter as an emerging company in a new and rapidly evolving market. We may not be able to address these risks, uncertainties and difficulties successfully, which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly, which makes them difficult to predict and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price.\nWe operate in a highly dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to- period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nFactors that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter include those described in this risk factor section including:\n\u2022 our gain or loss of a key venue partner, military partner, roaming partner or platform services partner;\n\u2022 the rate at which individuals adopt and continue to use our solutions;\n\u2022 the timing and success of new technology introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the growing prevalence of free Wi-Fi models and our ability to adapt and compete with free Wi-Fi;\n\u2022 the number of air travel passengers, particularly business travelers;\n\u2022 intellectual property disputes; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions in our domestic and foreign markets.\nDue to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance.\nWe may not maintain recent rates of revenue growth.\nAlthough our revenue has increased substantially over the last few years, we may not be able to maintain historical rates of revenue growth. We believe that our continued growth will depend, among other factors, on successfully implementing our business strategies, including our ability to:\n\u2022 attract new users, convert users of our single-use services into subscribers and keep existing subscribers actively using our services;\n\u2022 develop new sources of revenue from our users and partners;\n\u2022 react to changes in the way individuals access and use the mobile Internet;\n\u2022 expand into new markets;\n\u2022 increase the awareness of our brand;\n\u2022 retain our existing partners and attract new partners; and\n\u2022 provide our users with a superior experience, including customer support and payment experiences.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully implement any of these business strategies.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts.\nWe have dedicated a significant amount of resources to building out broadband and IPTV networks for troops stationed on U.S. military bases pursuant to our contracts with the U.S. government. The investment of these resources will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them including generation of revenues and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. As a result of these investments, we do not expect to be profitable in the near future. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us, either at its convenience or for default based on performance. Any such modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.\nSystem failures could harm our business.\nAlthough we seek to reduce the possibility of disruptions or other outages, our business may be disrupted by problems with our technology and systems, such as an access point failure at one of our managed and operated hotspots, or a backhaul disruption. We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any interruption in the ability of users to access our solution could harm our business and reputation.\nOur systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from telecommunications failures, computer denial-of-service attacks, power loss, computer viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems may also be damaged by break-ins, sabotage, and acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of the Boingo solution. We do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may result from service interruptions caused by system failures. If we are unable to resolve service interruptions quickly, our ability to acquire and retain customers will be impaired and our operating results and business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our international operations, which could harm the growth of our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, and the possibility that there may not be returns on these investments in the near future or at all. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses before we generate any material revenue in these new markets. Our expansion plans will require significant management attention and resources. We have limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets. Our ability to expand will also be limited by the demand for mobile Internet in international markets. Different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws in foreign countries may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nAny future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022 different technological solutions for mobile Internet than those used in North America;\n\u2022 varied, unfamiliar and unclear legal and regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022 legal, political, social or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries;\n\u2022 currency fluctuations;\n\u2022 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance and related risks;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022 potential adverse tax consequences.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to expand internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur industry is competitive and if we do not compete successfully, we could lose market share, experience reduced revenue or suffer losses.\nThe market for commercial mobile Wi-Fi solutions is competitive and impacted by technological change, and we expect competition with our current and potential competitors to intensify in the future. In particular, some of our competitors have taken steps or may decide to more aggressively compete against us, particularly in the market for venue build-outs of Wi-Fi and DAS solutions.\nOur competitors, many of whom are also our partners, include a variety of telecom operators and network operators, including AT&T, T-Mobile, Cablevision, Comcast and local operators. These and other competitors have developed or may develop technologies that compete directly with our solutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially longer operating histories. We may not be able to fund or invest in certain areas of our business to the same degree as our competitors. Many have substantially greater product development and marketing budgets and other financial and personnel resources than we do. Some also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger base of subscribers or users than we have. In addition, our competitors may provide services that we do not, such as cellular, local exchange and long distance services, voicemail and digital subscriber line. Users that desire these services may choose to also obtain mobile Wi-Fi Internet services from a competitor that provides these additional services rather than from us.\nFurthermore, we rely on several of our competitors as partners in roaming agreements. The roaming agreements provide that our retail customers and our wholesale partners' customers may use the Wi-Fi networks of our partners. One or more of our partners may deploy competing technologies that could reduce the partner's need to work with us under a roaming agreement. If our partners decide to terminate our roaming agreements, our network of Wi-Fi hotspots may be reduced, which may result in a significant disruption to our business.\nCompetition could increase our selling and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support\ncapabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe regulation of Internet communications, products and services is currently uncertain, which poses risks for our business from changes in laws, regulations, and interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations.\nThe current regulatory environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain. Many laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and often do not contemplate or address the specific issues associated with the Internet and related technologies. The scope of laws and regulations applicable to the Internet remains uncertain and is subject to statutory or interpretive change. We cannot be certain that we, our partners or our users are currently in compliance with regulatory or other legal requirements in the numerous countries in which our service is used. Our failure or the failure of our partners, users and others with whom we transact business, or to whom we license the Boingo solution, to comply with existing or future regulatory or other legal requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways.\nWe believe that the Boingo solution is on the forefront of mobile Internet technology, and therefore it may face greater regulatory scrutiny than other communications products and services. We cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions we have taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to the Boingo solution, which could be costly and difficult. Any of these events would adversely affect our operating results and business.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain personnel on a cost effective basis, our business could be harmed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and our highly qualified team of engineers, many of whom have numerous years of experience and specialized expertise in our business. If we are not successful in hiring and retaining highly qualified engineers, we may not be able to extend or maintain our engineering and technological expertise and our future product and service development efforts could be adversely affected. If we lose members of our senior management, this may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled managerial, operations, business development and marketing personnel. We have in the past maintained a rigorous, highly selective and time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has significantly contributed to our success to date. However, our highly selective hiring process has made it more difficult for us to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees, and, as we grow, our hiring process may prevent us from hiring the personnel we need in a timely manner. Moreover, the cost of living in the Los Angeles area, where our corporate headquarters is located, has been an impediment to attracting new employees in the past, and we expect that this will continue to impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively and our business could suffer significantly.\nOur failure to properly maintain our customers' confidential information and protect our network against security breaches, including cyber-security breaches, could harm our business and operating results.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other cyber-security developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect user transaction data. Cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and could lead to disruptions in our network, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Any compromises of our security could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to possible liability such as litigation claims, which would substantially harm our business and operating results. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches.\nMany countries, such as European Union member states as a result of the 2006 E.U. Data Retention Directive, are introducing, or have already introduced into local law some form of traffic and user data retention requirements, which are generally applicable to providers of electronic communications services. Retention periods and data types vary from country to country, and the various local data protection and other authorities may implement traffic and user retention requirements regarding certain data in different and potentially overlapping ways. Although the constitutionality of the 2006 E.U. Data Retention Directive has been questioned, we may be required to comply with data retention requirements in one or more jurisdictions, or we may be required to comply with these requirements in the future as a result of changes or modifications to the Boingo solution or changes or modifications to the technological infrastructure on which the Boingo solution is based. Failure to comply with these retention requirements may result in the imposition of costly penalties. Compliance with these retention requirements can be difficult and costly from a legal, operational and technical perspective and could harm our business and operational results.\nWe rely on our credit facility to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and other capital needs. If we are unable to achieve compliance with the credit facility covenants, or interest rates increase significantly, our business would be negatively impacted.\nIn November 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and related agreements with Bank of America, N.A. acting as agent for lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement places restrictions on our ability to take certain actions and sets standards for minimum financial performance. In addition to maintaining compliance with the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, our ability to increase the amount available for borrowing under our revolving line of credit depends on our ability to meet certain financial targets. If we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Credit Agreement, then the line of credit may be withdrawn, we may be required to immediately repay any outstanding obligation, and the additional funds will not be available to us to fund our capital needs.\nWe rely on a third-party customer support service provider for the majority of our customer support calls. If this service provider experiences operational difficulties or disruptions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on a third-party customer support service provider to handle most of our routine retail and military customer support cases. While we maintain limited customer support operations in our Los Angeles headquarters, if our relationship with our customer support service provider terminates unexpectedly, or if our customer service provider experiences operational difficulties, we may not be able to respond to customer support calls in a timely manner and the quality of our customer service would be adversely affected. This could harm our reputation and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract and retain users. In addition, the loss of the customer support service provider would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources, which could prove time-consuming and expensive.\nMaterial defects or errors in our software could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell the Boingo solution.\nThe software underlying the Boingo solution is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when the software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our software, and defects or errors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any defects or errors that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in:\n\u2022 a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of the Boingo solution;\n\u2022 sales credits or refunds to our users and wholesale partners;\n\u2022 loss of existing users and difficulty in attracting new users;\n\u2022 diversion of development resources;\n\u2022 harm to our reputation and brand image; and\n\u2022 increased insurance costs.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could harm our operating results.\nIf we are not successful in developing our mobile application for new devices and platforms, or if those solutions are not widely adopted, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.\nAs new mobile devices and platforms are developed, we may encounter problems in developing products for such new mobile devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such products. In addition, if we experience difficulties integrating our mobile applications into mobile devices, or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile applications, our future growth and our results of operations could suffer.\nIf we fail to maintain relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the integration of our software into mobile operating systems to allow mobile devices to connect to our network of Wi-Fi hotspots. If problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, or if our mobile application receives unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order of our products in the mobile application download stores, we may fail to attract or retain customers or partners, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost effectively develop our brand, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe market our solution under the Boingo brand. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand is important to achieving widespread acceptance of the Boingo solution, and is an important element in attracting and retaining customers and partners. Additionally, we believe that developing this brand in a cost effective manner is important in meeting our expected margins. Brand promotion activities may not result in increased revenue, and any increased revenue resulting from these promotion activities may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to cost effectively build and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract or retain customers or partners, and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and if we do not maintain and enhance our brand, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe believe that the Boingo brand is a critical part of our business. We continue to seek new ways to promote our brand through our managed and operated hotspots. We intend to enhance our brand through low-cost co-marketing arrangements with our partners and through periodic promotional and sponsorship activities and by continuing to leverage the reach of social media to interact with our customers. In order to maintain strong relationships with our venue and network partners, we may have to reduce the visibility of the Boingo brand or make other decisions that do not promote and maintain the Boingo brand, such as our custom branding alternatives that we offer to wholesale clients. If we fail to promote and maintain the Boingo brand, or if we incur significant expenses to promote the brand and are still unsuccessful in maintaining a strong brand, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business.\nIn recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. While we have not been specifically targeted, companies similar to us have been subject to patent lawsuits. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We may be subject to third-party claims in the future. The costs of supporting these litigations and disputes are considerable, and there can be no assurance that a favorable outcome will be obtained. We may be required to settle these litigations and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Claims that the Boingo solution infringes third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could also divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. The terms of any settlements or judgments may require us to:\n\u2022 cease distribution and back-end operation of the Boingo solution;\n\u2022 pay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022 expend significant resources to develop non-infringing solutions;\n\u2022 license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022 cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u2022 pay substantial damages to our partners to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing solutions sold to them with non-infringing solutions.\nAny of these unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We own four patents and have applications for six additional patents pending in the United States. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent the use or misappropriation of our proprietary\ninformation or infringement of our intellectual property rights. Our ability to police the use, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property is uncertain, particularly in countries other than the United States. Further, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented, or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete proprietary protection or any competitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies on their own now or in the future. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our solutions, trademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize the Boingo solution.\nWe have incorporated open source software into the Boingo solution. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, we are subject to the terms of open source licenses that have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that in the future these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize the Boingo solution. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties or to re-engineer our software in order to continue offering the Boingo solution, or to discontinue operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize unlicensed spectrum in certain of our offerings which is subject to intense competition, low barriers of entry and slowdowns due to multiple users.\nWe presently utilize unlicensed spectrum to provide our Wi-Fi Internet solutions. Unlicensed or \"free\" spectrum is available to multiple users and may suffer bandwidth limitations, interference and slowdowns if the number of users exceeds traffic capacity. The availability of unlicensed spectrum is not unlimited and others do not need to obtain permits or licenses to utilize the same unlicensed spectrum that we currently, or may in the future, utilize. The inherent limitations of unlicensed spectrum could potentially threaten our ability to reliably deliver our services. Moreover, the prevalence of unlicensed spectrum creates low barriers to entry in our industry.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nFluctuations in market price and volume are particularly common among securities of technology companies. As a result, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described in this risk factor section as well as the following factors, among others, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 general market conditions;\n\u2022 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022 changes in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;\n\u2022 termination of a relationship with a venue partner;\n\u2022 failure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022 any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Announcements by analysts that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock may relate to:\n\u2022 our operating results or forecasts;\n\u2022 new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us;\n\u2022 developments in our relationships with corporate customers;\n\u2022 announcements by our customers or competitors;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory policy or interpretation;\n\u2022 governmental investigations;\n\u2022 changes in the ratings of our stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;\n\u2022 our acquisitions of complementary businesses; or\n\u2022 our operational performance.\nInsiders have substantial control over us and are able to influence corporate matters.\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAs a public company, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy, and may divert resources and management attention from operating our business.\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. We must prepare and timely file financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, which imposes significant compliance obligations upon us. We are required, among other things, to:\n\u2022 prepare and file periodic reports, and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and NASDAQ rules; and\n\u2022 evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management's assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Further, we are required to obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31st each year from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations, or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges and opportunities could be significantly limited.\nWe could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility, which could divert management's attention and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe stock market in general and market prices for the securities of technology companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be attributed to being a newly public company. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In several recent situations where the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that\nstockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022 establish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022 require that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority stockholder vote;\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022 limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022 require supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in past and current years and may incur additional losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $62.9 million. We generated a net loss in 2014 and we are also currently investing in our future growth through expanding our network and buildouts, investing in our software, and consideration of future business acquisitions. As a result, we will incur higher depreciation and other operating expenses, as well as potential acquisition costs, that may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability in future periods unless and until these growth efforts generate enough revenue to exceed their operating costs and cover our additional overhead needed to scale our business for this anticipated growth. The current global financial condition may also impact our ability to achieve profitability if we cannot generate sufficient revenue to offset the increased costs. In addition, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of any acquired companies may also negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability. Finally, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to achieve or increase profitability.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value.", "PERMNO": 12798, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "WIFI"}
