Defense funding by the U.S. Government is expected to continue to be under pressure due to the overall economic environment, budget deficits and competing budget priorities. Cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization and other affordability analysis by the U.S. Government on defense spending could present some additional opportunities for us, but continued pressure on U.S. Government spending on defense could also adversely impact our Government Systems sales and profitability.\nThe U.S. Government has implemented various initiatives to address its fiscal challenges. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in security spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. In December 2013, the Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2013 was enacted, raising government discretionary spending limits temporarily for 2014 and 2015.\nMore recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 again raised the government discretionary spending limits temporarily for 2016 and 2017, after which the BCA will again be in force. The continued uncertainty surrounding the defense budget could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the defense industry in general.\nFurthermore, in years when the U.S. Government does not complete its annual budget and appropriations process prior to the beginning of its fiscal year (October 1), government operations are typically funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate in the new year, but generally does not authorize new spending initiatives. During periods covered by continuing resolutions (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), we may experience delays by the government in procurement of new or existing products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods. The government began operations in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 under a continuing resolution.\nWe offer a diverse range of defense products and services. We believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business; however, delays or termination of multiple or large programs or contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Potential changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful, and any replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.\nWe depend to a significant degree on U.S. Government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn addition to normal business risks, our supply of systems and products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks which are largely beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds\n\u2022\nthe ability of the U.S. Government to terminate, without prior notice, partially completed government programs and contracts that were previously authorized (although we may recover certain costs if terminated for convenience)\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies which may reflect military and political developments, including recent U.S. Government initiatives to gain increased access to intellectual property and to limit reimbursement of internal research and development as well as bid and proposal costs\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries\n\u2022\nintense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development\n\u2022\ndifficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work\n\u2022\nchanges over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, which generally result in adjustments of contract prices\n\u2022\nclaims based on U.S. Government work and violation of associated compliance and other requirements, which may result in fines, the cancellation or suspension of payments or suspension or debarment proceedings affecting potential further business with the U.S. Government\nWe are subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which we operate.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers on our programs and may be significantly larger than us. Among others, risks in the competitive environment include:\n\u2022\noriginal equipment manufacturers' efforts to vertically integrate\n\u2022\ncustomers seeking more rights in intellectual property developed in connection with their program, price concessions, extensive liability protections and other customer favorable contract terms\n\u2022\ncompetitors offering lower prices and new solutions, developing new technologies or otherwise capturing more market share\nInternational conflicts and terrorism may adversely affect our business.\nInternational conflicts and political turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere and the possibility of future terrorist attacks cause significant uncertainty with respect to business and financial markets and may adversely affect our business. These international conflicts also affect the price of oil, which has a significant impact on the financial health of our commercial customers. Although our Government Systems business may experience greater demand for its products as a result of increased government defense spending, factors arising (directly or indirectly) from international conflicts or terrorism which may adversely affect our commercial business include reduced aircraft build rates, upgrades, maintenance and spending on discretionary products such as in-flight entertainment, as well as increases in the cost of property and aviation products insurance and increased restrictions placed on our insurance policies.\nOur business is heavily concentrated in the aviation industry.\nAs a provider of products and services to the aviation industry, we are significantly affected by the overall economic condition of that industry. The aviation industry is historically cyclical.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted, among other things, by the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in demand for aircraft (for example, softness in demand for business jets) and delayed aircraft delivery schedules\n\u2022\nbankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our existing and potential customers\n\u2022\nreductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support\n\u2022\nretirement or storage of older generation aircraft, resulting in fewer retrofits and less demand for services for those aircraft, as well as the increased availability of used or recycled equipment on the market\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing for airlines or aircraft\n\u2022\nimpact on the aviation industry due to the volatility of fuel prices\n\u2022\ndisruptions to commercial air travel demand\nA global or regional recession may adversely affect us.\nIf a recession emerges that impacts where we do business, risks may include:\n\u2022\ndeclines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers\n\u2022\nadverse impacts on our access to short-term commercial paper borrowings or other credit sources\n\u2022\nsupply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from international sales and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.\nIn 2016, 41 percent of our total revenues were from sales of our products and services internationally, including foreign military sales. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements and potential changes, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions, anti-bribery, antitrust and data privacy requirements\n\u2022\nchanges in government spending on defense programs, including spending declines in European countries\n\u2022\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees\n\u2022\nrequirements of certain customers which obligate us to specified levels of in-country purchases, manufacturing or investments, known as offsets, and penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements\n\u2022\nimpacts associated with foreign currency volatility\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation\nWe have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions and partnerships that involve risks and uncertainties.\nWe completed the following acquisitions in the past three fiscal years:\n\u2022\nin February 2016, we acquired the Matrix series projector product line from Christie Digital Systems\n\u2022\nin August 2015, we acquired ICG\n\u2022\nin March 2015, we acquired Pacific Avionics\n\u2022\nin December 2013, we acquired ARINC\nWe also completed several joint ventures and strategic alliances (partnerships) in the past few years.\nWe intend to make acquisitions and partnerships in the future in an effort to enhance shareowner value. Acquisitions and partnerships involve certain risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and commencing partnership operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration or commencement\n\u2022\nchallenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost and revenue synergies and other expected benefits\n\u2022\nrisk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and the targeted technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets\n\u2022\nrisk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties\n\u2022\nloss of key employees of the acquired businesses or joint venture\n\u2022\nrisk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations\n\u2022\nrisk of litigation associated with an acquisition\nOn October 23, 2016 we entered into an agreement to acquire B/E Aerospace, which is expected to close in the spring of 2017 subject to various closing conditions. Additional information related to this acquisition is contained in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns.\nDuring 2016, approximately 93 percent of our total sales were, and a significant portion of our anticipated future sales will be, from fixed-price contracts. This allows us to benefit from cost savings, but it carries the burden of potential cost overruns since we assume all of the cost risk. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can incur losses on these contracts. These fixed-price contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the customer may compel us to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the entire incremental cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these projects involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw\nmaterials, problems with subcontractors and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet project deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize earnings from our contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCosts of certain employee and retiree benefits may rise.\nAlthough we have taken action seeking to contain volatility in the costs related to medical and pension benefits, there are risks that our costs for these benefits will increase as a result of:\n\u2022\ncontinued increases in medical costs related to current employees due to increased usage of medical benefits, medical inflation and the impact of U.S. Government health care legislation\n\u2022\ncontinued increases in the average life span of retirees\n\u2022\nmaterial changes in legislation or market dynamics impacting medical or pension matters\n\u2022\nthe effect declines in the stock and bond markets have on our pension plan assets\n\u2022\nreductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our retirement benefit obligations\nTax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures.\nWe depend on critical suppliers and subcontractors.\nWe do not always have alternate sources of supply readily available for certain goods or services, such as liquid crystal displays. The loss of a significant supplier or subcontractor or their inability to meet performance, quality or delivery requirements due to natural disaster, financial stress, capacity constraints, military conflicts or other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on specialized test equipment.\nSome of our specialized test equipment that supports the reliability of our products and systems is the result of significant investment. Back-up test equipment may not be readily available. Damage to our specialized test equipment may result in protracted production recovery and may adversely impact our ability to service our products.\nA cybersecurity incident, network failure or other business disruption could have negative impacts.\nWe face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated information technology (IT) failures. Possible areas of significant exposure to cyber threats or other disruptions include our enterprise information technology resources, our information management network that provides communication services to customers and our flight deck communication products and solutions. Any of these threats or disruptions may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks may include:\n\u2022\nadverse effects to future results due to the theft, destruction, loss, corruption or release of personal data, confidential information or intellectual property\n\u2022\noperational or business disruptions resulting from the failure of IT or other systems and subsequent mitigation activities\n\u2022\nnegative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, suppliers, employees, shareowners and others\nRisks Related to Our B/E Aerospace Transaction:\nThe proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the proposed transaction could have material adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the approval by our shareowners of the issuance of the shares of our common stock in the proposed transaction, the approval by B/E Aerospace stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the proposed transaction uncertain. Also, either we or B/E Aerospace may generally terminate the transaction if it has not been consummated by October 21, 2017.\nIf the proposed transaction is not completed, our businesses may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the proposed transaction, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock could decline\n\u2022\nwe could owe substantial termination fees to B/E Aerospace under certain circumstances\n\u2022\nif the transaction is abandoned, our shareowners cannot be certain that we could find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms of the proposed B/E Aerospace acquisition\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the proposed transaction could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees\nIn addition, if the proposed transaction is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed transaction.\nThe materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact our ongoing businesses.\nSimilarly, delays in the completion of the proposed transaction could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the proposed transaction.\nOur agreement to acquire B/E Aerospace contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the proposed acquisition, could discourage a potential acquiror of us from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay substantial termination fees to B/E Aerospace.\nOur agreement to acquire B/E Aerospace contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to initiate, seek, solicit, knowingly encourage, knowingly induce or engage in negotiations or discussions with respect to, or approve or recommend, any third-party proposal for certain alternative transactions. Further, even if our board of directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the issuance of the shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed transaction, unless the agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, we will still be required to submit our acquisition-related proposals to a vote at a special meeting of our shareowners.\nIn some circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we could be required to pay a termination fee of $300 million to B/E Aerospace. In addition, if the agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain our shareowner approval, we may still have to reimburse B/E Aerospace up to $56 million for their fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction. In particular, a termination fee, if applicable, may be substantial, and could result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to our shareowners than it might otherwise have proposed to pay absent such a fee.\nThe proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace is subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods and the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay the completion of the proposed acquisition.\nBefore the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace may be completed, any waiting period under applicable U.S. antitrust laws must have expired or been terminated and any authorizations or consents under certain other competition laws of foreign jurisdictions required with respect to the proposed transaction must have been obtained. Regulators may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions in connection with their authorization of or consent to the proposed transaction, and such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay completion of the proposed transaction or impose additional material costs on or materially limit the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the transaction. There can be no assurance that regulators will choose not to impose such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions, and, if imposed, such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions may delay or lead to the abandonment of the proposed transaction.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties while the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the proposed transaction, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the proposed transaction is completed.\nEach of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the proposed transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plan. Prior to completion of the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the proposed transaction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel.\nIf the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed acquisition of B/E Aerospace. These costs are primarily associated with financing for the proposed transaction and the fees of financial advisors, consultants, accountants and attorneys.\nCautionary Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain statements, including certain projections and business trends, that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
