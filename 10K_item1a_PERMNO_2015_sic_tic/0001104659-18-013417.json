RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce profits. The primary source of our income is the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. As prevailing interest rates change, net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we were asset sensitive and would benefit from an increase in interest rates. In the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would expect to experience a 4.4% increase in net interest income. Because the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions, these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.\nIn addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations. An increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume and overall profitability. In addition, our deposits are subject\nto increases in interest rates and as interest rates rise we may lose these deposits if we do not pay competitive interest rates, which may affect our liquidity and profits.\nOur emphasis on commercial loans may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2017, $1.58 billion, or 39.2%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans, $670.1 million, or 16.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans, and $146.6 million, or 3.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial construction loans, including loans for the acquisition and development of property. At December 31, 2017, we had a total of 37 land acquisition and development loans totaling $117.1 million included primarily in commercial real estate and commercial construction loans, which consist of 14 residential land acquisition and development loans totaling $52.8 million and 23 commercial land acquisition and development loans totaling $64.3 million. We are committed to growing our commercial banking business and, over the past few years, we have hired additional lenders with significant experience in our market area to expand our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending efforts. We expect to continue to look for additional qualified lenders to further accelerate our commercial loan growth.\nCommercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one- to four-family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are out of the control of the borrower and lender could impact the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the affected property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced with respect to commercial real estate properties than residential properties. Also, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. Further, unlike residential mortgages or multi-family and commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default.\nCommercial business loans include shared national credits, which are participations in loans or loan commitments of at least $20.0 million that are shared by three or more banks. Effective January 1, 2018, the federal banking agencies have changed the aggregate loan commitment threshold for inclusion in the shared national credit program from $20 million to $100 million. Included in our shared national credit portfolio are purchased participations and assignments in leveraged lending transactions. Leveraged lending transactions are generally used to support a merger- or acquisition-related transaction, to back a recapitalization of a company\u2019s balance sheet or to refinance debt. When considering a participation in the leveraged lending market, we will participate only in first lien senior secured term loans that are highly rated (investment grade) by the rating agencies and that trade in active secondary markets. Even though we intend to hold these loans in our portfolio, we actively monitor the secondary market for these types of loans to ensure that we maintain flexibility to sell such loans in the event of deteriorating credit quality. To further minimize risk, based on our current capital levels and loan portfolio, we have limited the total amount of leveraged loans to $150.0 million with no single obligor exceeding $15.0 million while maintaining single industry concentrations below 30%. However, we may reevaluate these limits in future periods. At December 31, 2017, shared national credits totaled $199.5 million, which included $77.3 million of leveraged lending transactions.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages that we do not, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages that we do not, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nOur banking and non-banking subsidiaries also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies, on-line banks, financial technology companies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over our banking and non-banking subsidiaries in providing certain products and services. Technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking and non-banking services, reduce our market share, and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nIn addition, our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and we are aware that certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nOur emphasis on residential mortgage loans and home equity loans exposes us to lending risks, and the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nAt December 31, 2017, $943.6 million, or 23.4% of our loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans and $228.1 million, or 5.7% of our loan portfolio, consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages and home equity loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. Real estate values are affected by various factors, including supply and demand, changes in general or regional economic conditions, interest rates, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters. Future weakness in economic conditions also could result in reduced loan demand and a decline in loan originations. In particular, a significant decline in real estate values would likely lead to a decrease in new multi-family, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and home equity loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in our real estate loan portfolio.\nA return to recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings.\nAlthough economic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession in June 2009, economic growth has been slower than in past recoveries and the recovery is entering its eighth year which is longer than past recoveries. A return of recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increases in unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our results of operations will be negatively impacted.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the effect of existing economic conditions. In addition, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family, commercial business and commercial real estate loans, as well any future credit deterioration, could also require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant percentage of our assets is invested in securities which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio.\nOur results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income. At December 31, 2017, 24.6% of our assets were invested in investment securities, overnight investments and cash and due from banks. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. While we intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest income, we may not be able to increase originations of loans that are acceptable to us.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our strategy of growing through mergers and acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions have contributed significantly to our growth in the past, and remain a component of our business model. Most recently, as previously disclosed, on April 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Conestoga Bank. Additionally, it is possible that we could acquire other banking institutions, other financial services companies or branches of banks in the future. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and, therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share. Our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on various factors, including (1) our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities, (2) our ability to finance and complete transactions on acceptable terms and at acceptable prices and (3) our ability to receive the necessary regulatory and, when required, shareholder approvals. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including (1) our ability to integrate the branches and operations we acquire, and the internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations and (2) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations. Our inability to engage in an acquisition or merger for any of these reasons could have an adverse impact on the implementation of our business strategies.\nWe hold goodwill, an intangible asset, that could be classified as impaired in the future. If goodwill is considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings and the book value of goodwill would decrease.\nWe are required to test our goodwill for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, other changes included: (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.\nThe recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe preparation of our tax returns requires the use of estimates and interpretations of complex tax laws and regulations and is subject to review by taxing authorities.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense and filing returns, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net deferred tax assets totaling $23.0 million. These deferred tax assets can only be realized if we generate taxable income in the future. We regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, we consider estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. We currently maintain a valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses that management believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. We expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryforward periods. Therefore, no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. However, if an unanticipated event occurred that materially changed pre-tax and taxable income in future periods, an increase in the valuation allowance may become necessary and it could be material to our financial statements. Our net deferred tax asset of $23.0 million was determined based on the current enacted federal tax rate of 21%. The passage of the H.R. 1 Act in December 2017 lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The Company re-measured its net deferred tax assets at the current 21% federal corporate tax rate and, as a result, the Company recorded $13.1 million of additional income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. Any possible future reduction in federal tax rates, would reduce the value of our net deferred tax assets and result in immediate write-down of the net deferred tax assets though our statement of operations, the effect of which would be material.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the Department as our primary regulator. Beneficial Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Beneficial Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may increase our costs of operations and have a material impact on our operations.\nWe are now subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board approved new rules that amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Beneficial Bank and Beneficial Bancorp. The final rules implement the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective on January 1, 2015, and revise the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (1) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (3) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement started to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Beneficial Bank and Beneficial Bancorp could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, market risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies and there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves to be ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nAlthough we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party\u2019s compliance with the terms of the agreement. Although we believe that we have adequate information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe failure of other companies to adequately provide key components of our business infrastructure could adversely affect our operations and revenues.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core processing systems. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully and our agreements include requirements regarding the levels of their service quality, we ultimately do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those that result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.", "PERMNO": 92195, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BNCL"}
