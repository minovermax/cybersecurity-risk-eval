RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and investors may lose all or a part of their investment.\nThis Annual Report contains certain statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, readers should specifically consider the various factors identified in this Annual Report, including the matters set forth below, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.\nThe risks described below do not purport to be all the risks to which we could be exposed. This section is a summary of certain risks and is not set out in any particular order of priority. They are the risks that we presently believe are material to our operations. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects.\nAlthough we were incorporated in 2005, we did not sell our first Ekso medical device until 2012 and did not sell our first industrial unit until 2016. Therefore, we have limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our business plan or performance and prospects can be made. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established business and creating a new industry. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products and services, or that although functional and scalable, our products and services will not be economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our competitors market a superior or equivalent product; that we are not able to upgrade and enhance our technologies and products to accommodate new features and expanded service offerings; or that we fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our products. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that we can successfully address these challenges. If we are unsuccessful, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use, or are otherwise more attractive, we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies.\nThe medical technology and industrial robotics industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change, and we will face competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Competitors may include large medical device and other companies, some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nOur competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. Competitors may offer, or may attempt to develop, more efficacious, safer, cheaper, or more convenient alternatives to our products, including alternatives that could make the need for robotic exoskeletons obsolete. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. The entry into the market of manufacturers located in low-cost manufacturing locations may also create pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets. Our future success depends, among other things, upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances, and upon our ability to successfully implement our marketing strategies and execute our research and development plan.\nOur products or exoskeletons generally may not be accepted in the market.\nWe cannot be certain that our current products or any other products we may develop or market will achieve or maintain market acceptance. Market acceptance of our products depends on many factors, including our ability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding our products, convince distributors and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies, convince health insurers and other third-party payers to cover and provide adequate payments for any products that are used for medical or therapeutic purposes, demonstrate that our products are reliable and supported by us in the field, supply and service sufficient quantities of products directly or through marketing alliances, and price products competitively in light of the current macroeconomic environment, which, particularly in the case of the medical device industry, is becoming increasingly price sensitive.\nIn addition, the market for medical and industrial exoskeletons is new and unproven. We cannot be certain that the market for robotic exoskeletons will continue to develop, or that robotic exoskeletons for medical or industrial use will achieve market acceptance. If the exoskeleton market fails to develop, or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nProtecting our patent and other proprietary rights can be costly, and we may not be able to attain, defend or maintain such rights, which could harm our business.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. Failure to protect or to obtain, maintain or extend adequate patent and other intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our competitive advantage and impair our business. Our issued patents may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and our patent applications may not result in issued patents. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner or may challenge the validity of our patents. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights ultimately may be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain any of our patents that issue.\nFurthermore, we have not filed applications for all of our patents internationally and may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products in other countries. These include, in some cases, countries in which we are currently selling products and countries in which we intend to sell products in the future.\nWe have agreed to transfer and license intellectual property and other rights for the manufacture and sale of our products in China and certain other Asian territories to a joint venture that we do not control and that may not act in our best interests, and we may not receive all anticipated benefits from the arrangement.\nIn consideration for a 20% stake in the China JV and royalty rights based on net sales of the JV Products by the China JV following a royalty-free period, we have licensed certain patented technologies and non-patented manufacturing technologies in the JV Territory to the China JV. We have also granted to the China JV a license to use our trademarks free of charge in the JV Territory. As a result of these transfers and licenses, and the other agreements we have agreed to with the China JV and the Joint Venture Partners, we will be reliant on the China JV for the manufacturing and sale of the foregoing products in the JV Territory. We will also be reliant on our Joint Venture Partners to fund the China JV in the future, and their failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the China JV to effectively manufacture and sell products. Even to the extent the China JV is successful in manufacturing and selling products, aside from a royalty fee based on a mid-single digits percentage of the net sales revenue of the products manufactured and sold by the China JV, we will only benefit from any profit in the China JV to the extent of our minority equity ownership therein.\nAs a result of our 20% ownership stake and the terms of the China JV agreements, we will not have control of the operations of the China JV, which will be governed by a five-member board of directors to which we may only designate one director in our sole discretion, with the majority of such directors being designated by our Joint Venture Partners. Accordingly, if our relationship with our Joint Venture Partners deteriorates, or if our strategic objectives diverge from that of our Joint Venture Partners, our success in the joint venture and our business and operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by the China JV, and we have no control over the conduct or actions of our Joint Venture Partners. Moreover, the China JV may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls (including internal control over financial reporting) that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities\nFinally, because the China JV will only manufacture and sell products in the JV Territory, we may still need to expend resources on the manufacturing and sale of our product in other markets in Asia.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had not transferred the patented technologies pursuant to the Technology License Agreement.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nThe industries in which we operate, including, in particular, the medical device industry, are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we might be the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause competition in our industry is intense, competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our issued patents, patents of our licensors or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly, or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.\nSome of the patents and patent applications in the intellectual property portfolio are not within our complete control, which could reduce the value of such patents.\nSome of our U.S. patents (which have associated international patents and applications) are co-owned by UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley has exclusively licensed its rights under many of these patents to us, but we do not have an exclusive license to UC Berkeley\u2019s rights under three of these patents.\nUC Berkeley has licensed their U.S. rights in two of these three co-owned patents to an unrelated third-party.\nThe third patent is a continuation-in-part of a patent that UC Berkeley has licensed to us. Under the terms of the relevant license agreement between us and UC Berkeley, we have exclusive rights to any claims that are fully supported by the specification in the parent application. However, any claims that are not based on the specification in the parent application are co-owned by UC Berkeley and us, and UC Berkeley\u2019s rights in respect of such claims are not exclusively licensed to us. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain a license to UC Berkeley\u2019s rights in any such claims on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and UC Berkeley may choose to license its rights to third parties instead of us.\nIn addition, in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from Equipois, we assumed the rights and obligations of Equipois with respect to certain patents and patent applications under an in-license of intellectual property from a third-party and subject to an out-license of that intellectual property to an unrelated third-party for use in a particular field. We do not have complete control over the prosecution of these patent applications. As well, the license of intellectual property rights under these patents to third parties could reduce the value of our patent portfolio and limit any income or license fees that we might receive if we were to attempt to transfer or license our rights under any of our co-owned or licensed patents.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third-parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to two exclusive license agreements and one amendment with UC Berkeley, covering ten patents exclusively licensed to us. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from Equipois, we assumed the rights and obligations of Equipois with respect to certain patents and patent applications under an in-license of intellectual property from a third-party and subject to an out-license of that intellectual property to an unrelated third-party for use in a particular field. We may also need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of\nour devices or any other devices we may identify and pursue. Our license agreements with UC Berkeley and the rights and obligations that we assumed in connection with the Equipois acquisition impose various development, diligence, commercialization, and other obligations on us, and we any future license agreements may impose similar or other obligations on us. For example, under our license agreements with UC Berkeley we are required to submit a commercialization plan with performance milestones and progress report to UC Berkeley, and must satisfy specified minimum annual royalty payment obligations. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If our license agreements with UC Berkeley is terminated, or if our agreements granting us intellectual property rights in connection with the Equipois acquisition or any future agreements granting us material intellectual property rights are terminated or impeded in a material way, competitors or other third parties would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products that may be identical or functionally similar to our devices and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of such devices. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise between us and our counterparties regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u00b7\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our devices, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative research and development relationships;\n\u00b7\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u00b7\nthe priority of invention of patented or patentable technology.\nIn addition, certain provisions in our license agreement with UC Berkeley may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected devices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our devices for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our devices are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new devices, patents protecting such devices might expire before or shortly after such devices are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our medical device products, or if clearances or approvals for future products or modifications to existing products are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nOur EksoGT, EksoNR and EksoUE products are medical devices and are regulated by the FDA, the European Union and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the United States. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical products. Our failure to comply with these complex laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\nIn the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a premarket approval or PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Both the PMA and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive,\nlengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process may take anywhere from several months to over a year. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials.\nThe FDA also has substantial discretion in the medical device review process. Despite the time, effort and cost, we cannot assure you that any particular device will be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business. Failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional development, standardized testing, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business.\nThe FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\na medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a device lawfully marketed either as a grandfathered device or one that was cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process;\n\u00b7\na medical device candidate may not be deemed to be in conformance with applicable standards and regulations;\n\u00b7\nFDA or other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials or other product testing date to be sufficient;\n\u00b7\nother non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers, thereby restricting export; or\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nEven after regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, a cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to extensive regulatory requirements relating to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nadverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u00b7\ncivil or criminal penalties or fines;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and\n\u00b7\nimport and export restrictions.\nIf imposed on us, any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nModifications to our EksoNR and our future products may require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained\nOn April 4, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market our EksoGT robotic exoskeleton for use in the treatment of individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke, individuals with SCI at levels T4 to L5, and individuals with SCI at levels of T3 to C7 (ASIA D), in accordance with the device\u2019s labeling. On July 19, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to expand/clarify the indications and labeling to expressly include individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke who have upper extremity function of at least four-fifths in only one arm. Our prior cleared indications for use statement required that individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke have upper extremity function of at least four-fifths in both arms.\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade our robotic exoskeleton platform to incorporate new software and hardware\nenhancements. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device, including our EksoGT, that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance based on the final guidance document issued by the FDA in October 2017 addressing when to submit a new 510(k) application due to modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices and a separate guidance document on when to submit a new 510(k) application due to software changes to 510(k)-cleared devices. Although largely aligned with the FDA\u2019s longstanding guidance document issued in 1997, the 2017 guidance includes targeted changes intended to provide additional clarity on when a new 510(k) application is needed. The FDA may review our determinations regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary, and may not agree with our decisions. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nWe may introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. The products may be subject to various regulatory processes, and we may need to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser of our products believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or if a potential purchaser is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory approval, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. As a result, new product introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\nThe manufacture of our products is subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.\nWe are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of our marketed products. These regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production costs and may even prevent us from making our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand. If we change our approved manufacturing process, the FDA may need to review the process before it may be used. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nFederal, state and non-U.S. regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes. The complexity, timeframes and costs associated with obtaining marketing clearances are unknown. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, these changes might have on our business, the impact could be material.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\nAny cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses and our promotional materials must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations. We believe that the specific use for which our products are marketed fall within the scope of the indications for use that have been cleared by the FDA. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nFailure to comply with anti-kickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business. These laws may constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future. The principal U.S. federal laws implicated include, but are not limited to, those that prohibit, among other things,\n(i) filing, or causing to be filed, false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the false claims laws, (ii) payment, solicitation or receipt of unlawful inducements, directly or indirectly, for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the anti-kickback laws, and (iii) health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the Stark law. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other government funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In addition, we may be subject to federal and state data privacy laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. We are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege we have engaged in fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nChanges in law or regulation could make it more difficult and costly for us to manufacture, market and distribute our products or obtain or maintain regulatory approval of new or modified products.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Elections could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nAny change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market, and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval, for any new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nHealthcare changes in the U.S. and other countries, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could have a negative impact on our future operating results.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted into law. The legislation seeks to reform the United States healthcare system. It is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time. We expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations. The ACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also possible that the ACA will result in lower reimbursements. While the ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of our products remains uncertain. The current U.S. Presidential administration and the majority party in both Houses of U.S. Congress have indicated their desire to repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. It is unclear whether, when and how that repeal could be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector might be. A number of lawsuits have been filed challenging various aspects of the ACA and related regulations. In addition, the efficacy of the ACA is the subject of much debate among members of Congress and the public. On December 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas held the individual mandate provisions, and therefore the entirety of ACA, unconstitutional. The impact of the ruling is stayed as it is appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Our business may be materially and adversely impacted in the event that the ACA in part, or in its entirety, is ruled unconstitutional. Furthermore, the uncertainty regarding the constitutionality of the ACA, or specific provisions therein, may negatively affect our business.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and signed into law, one part of which repeals the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d introduced by the ACA starting in 2019. The repeal of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d may have an adverse effect on ACA insurance markets and lead to further legislative changes. In addition, the new law imposes a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that will apply to U.S. sales of our medical device products. In January 2018, President Trump signed into law a spending package that included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, which lapsed on December 31, 2019. This tax has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our gross margin. There have been other changes to the ACA since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Congress could still consider additional legislation to repeal or replace all or certain elements of the ACA. In addition, other reform legislation has been passed subsequent to the enactment of the ACA, including measures that reduced reimbursement for certain providers and entities under federal health care programs. The outlook for the healthcare sector is unclear, and we are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations. Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, implementation of Medicare and/or Medicaid, and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the healthcare industry. In the event that legal challenges are successful, or the ACA, is repealed or materially amended, particularly any elements of the ACA that are beneficial to our business or that cause changes in the health insurance industry, including reimbursement and coverage by private payers or, Medicare or Medicaid payers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes may occur, certain proposals, including a repeal or material amendment of the ACA, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, even if the ACA is not amended or repealed, the President and the executive branch of the federal government have a significant impact on the implementation of the provisions of the ACA, and the current or future administrations could make changes impacting the implementation and enforcement of the ACA, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our medical products, or malfunction of our medical products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting or MDR regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. For example, we have been informed of a limited number of events with respect to our EksoNR or EksoGT devices that have been determined to be reportable pursuant to the MDR regulations. In each case, the required MDR report was filed with the FDA.\nIn addition, all manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer\u2019s device is suspected to have caused, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required. The events described above that were reported to the FDA were also reported to the relevant EU regulatory authorities.\nWe are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all Company-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Recalls of our products, or agency actions relating to our failure to comply with our reporting or recordkeeping obligations, could harm our reputation and financial results.\nDiscovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. In addition, manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. To date, we have initiated only one field action in which we voluntarily accelerated our maintenance schedule based on field usage.\nWhen a medical human exoskeleton is used by a paralyzed individual to walk, the individual relies completely on the exoskeleton\nto hold them upright. There are many exoskeleton components that, if they were to fail catastrophically, could cause a fall resulting in severe injury or death of the patient. Certain of our competitors have reported injuries caused by the malfunction of human exoskeleton devices (in at least one case to the FDA). Injuries caused by the malfunction or misuse of human exoskeleton devices, even where such malfunction or misuse occurs with respect to one of our competitor\u2019s products, could cause regulatory agencies to implement more conservative regulations on the medical human exoskeleton industry, which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nSimilarly, when an industrial exoskeleton is used by a healthy individual - for example to operate heavy machinery overhead - malfunction of the device at an inopportune moment could result in severe injury or death of the person using the device. Such occurrences could result in regulatory action on the part of OSHA or its foreign counterparts.\nAny future recalls of any of our products could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nIn addition, personal injuries relating to the use of our products could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in substantial damages, be costly and time-consuming to defend and could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices and industrial products entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage is subject to deductibles and limitations, and may not be adequate to cover future claims. A successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent the successful commercialization of our products, cause a significant financial burden on us, or both, which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWarranty claims or any other service and repairs provided by us at our expense could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales of our EksoNR and EksoGT generally include a one-year warranty for parts and services in the U.S. and a two-year warranty in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We also generally provide customers with an option to purchase an extended warranty for up to an additional three years. The costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty-related legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. As we enhance our product and in an effort to build our brand and drive adoption, we have elected to incur increased service expenses related to an accelerated maintenance program, field corrections and the implementation of technological improvements developed subsequent to many of our units being placed into service, sometimes outside of its warranty and contractual obligations. Continuation of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIf use of our products by healthcare providers and related facilities becomes dependent on their ability to obtain reimbursement for use of our products from third-party payers, failure to both obtain and maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for such services would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through payment systems managed by various third-party payers, including governmental agencies worldwide, private insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care, the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) utilized, available budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer\u2019s discretion. Reimbursement to healthcare providers and related facilities for rehabilitation services are not dependent on the use of our products. However, to the extent that the adoption of our product by our customers becomes dependent in the future on their ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for treatments provided using our product from third-party payers, the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products and reimbursement rates could also affect the acceptance rates of new technologies.\nWe have no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our medical device products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d programs implemented by various public and private payers, and expansion of payment\nbundling schemes such as Accountable Care Organizations, and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers). Should the use of our products be a factor in reimbursements in the future, these considerations may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our products.\nIn addition to the ACA, which is intended to reduce the cost of healthcare over time, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we do business. Pricing pressure has also increased in these markets due to continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally. Should the use of our products be a factor in reimbursements in the future, reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could adversely affect customer demand or the price customers may be willing to pay for our products and could result in decreased revenue.\nClinical studies regarding our products may not provide sufficient data to either cause third-party payers to approve reimbursement or to make human exoskeletons a standard of care.\nOur business plan relies on broad adoption of human exoskeletons to provide neuro-rehabilitation in the form of gait training to individuals who have suffered a neurological injury or disorder. Although use of human exoskeletons in neuro-rehabilitation is new, use of robotic devices to provide gait training has been going on for over a decade and the clinical studies relating to such devices have had both positive and negative outcomes. In the past, some in the rehabilitation community have questioned the use of robotic devices based on the data from some of these studies. Although we believe that human exoskeletons will outperform such robotic equipment, this has not been proven or broadly accepted by the rehabilitation community. Furthermore, it may prove impossible to prove an advantage in a timely manner, or at all, which could prevent broad adoption of our products.\nPart of our business plan relies on broad adoption of our robotic exoskeleton to provide \u201cearly mobilization\u201d of individuals who have been immobilized by an injury, disease, or other condition. Although the health benefits of other methods of \u201cearly mobilization\u201d have been demonstrated in clinical studies in fields such as stroke, those studies did not test early mobilization with human exoskeletons directly. To date, our device has been the subject of several clinical trials, some of which have been partially sponsored by us, but most of which are non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. Data from these studies was provided to the FDA as part of our 510(k) application submissions. In addition, there are several ongoing independent studies to investigate additional indications for use for our device, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the Ekso device, and we are currently in the planning stage for several Company-led studies. Further, a Company-sponsored clinical trial, entitled WISE (Walking Improvement for SCI with Exoskeletons), is being conducted to evaluate improvement in independent gait speeds of SCI patients undergoing rehabilitation with the EksoNR and EksoGT and to compare it to both conventional therapy and a control group.\nIf current and future clinical trials do not provide sufficient data to support our belief that early mobilization through the use of exoskeletons improves health outcomes, or such studies actually contradict that belief, market acceptance of the human exoskeletons could fail to increase or could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nAny studies that we initiate, whether to drive market adoption and support commercialization, or to support additional product submissions or new claims, will be expensive and time consuming, which could harm our financial results.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to drive market adoption and support commercialization, or to support additional product submissions or new claims, is time consuming and expensive. Conducting successful clinical studies requires the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in future clearances or approvals of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, all clinical trial activities that we undertake are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. Clinical trials intended to support a 510(k) applications or PMA must be conducted in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Good Clinical Practice regulations and similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions. Sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy may be required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support future clearances and approvals. Compliance with these regulations is costly, and any failure to do so could delay or prevent us from using data obtained from such activities to support our claims that a product is safe and effective.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support new product submissions or claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nDespite considerable time and expense invested in clinical trials, the FDA may not consider any data that we obtain adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy for future submissions. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our intended claims or demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials or studies could delay the filing of associated product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize products requiring submission of clinical data or relying on clinical data for market acceptance.\nIt is also possible that patients enrolled in a clinical trial will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s safety profile, which could cause us to delay or abandon development of such product\nSecurity breaches could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and business.\nWe process, store, and transmit sensitive data, including those provided by employees, customers and vendors. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or nefarious actors or similar disruptive problems. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information handled by us or our service providers may jeopardize the security or integrity of information in our computer systems and networks or those of our employees, customers or vendors and cause significant interruptions and/or errors in our products and services.\nThe systems and processes that we have developed that are designed to protect information processed, stored or transmitted on our systems and prevent data loss and other security breaches cannot provide absolute security. In addition, we may not successfully implement remediation plans to address all potential exposures. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches could expose us or our employees, customers or vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, cause employees, customers or vendors to lose confidence in our data protection measures, damage our reputation, adversely affect our operating results or result in litigation or potential liability for us. While we maintain insurance coverage, we do not maintain cyber insurance and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses associated with a cyber-attack or security breach.\nOur business may suffer if we are not able to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. In addition, as we introduce new products or services, we will need to hire additional personnel. Currently, competition for personnel with the required knowledge, skill and experiences is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, where we are headquartered, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our management and sales teams may adversely affect our operations.\nOver the last two years, we have experienced turnover in our senior management and sales teams, including most recently, Christian Babini, who resigned as VP of Sales, Americas in January 2019. During 2018, Russell DeLonzor also resigned as Chief Operating Officer in December 2018. Maximilian Scheder-Bieschin, our former Chief Financial Officer, retired as Chief Financial Officer as of August 1, 2018 and transitioned to being a consultant until December 31, 2018, and effective August 13, 2018, John F. Glenn was appointed as our new Chief Financial Officer. As well, Gregory Davault, previously our Chief Marketing Officer, resigned effective as of May 15, 2018.\nWhile we expect to engage in an orderly transition process as we integrate newly appointed officers and managers, we face a variety of risks and uncertainties relating to management transition and execution of our sales strategy, including diversion of management attention from business concerns, failure to retain other key personnel, loss of institutional knowledge, loss of sales prospects and inability to replenish our sales team in a manner needed to execute our sales strategy. These risks and uncertainties could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations, stock price and research and development of our products.\nWe will experience long and variable sales cycles, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter and may result in volatility in our stock price.\nThe EksoNR has a lengthy sale and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of\nsenior management at purchasing institutions, which may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic uncertainties and political concerns;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products or product lines;\n\u00b7\nproduct modifications;\n\u00b7\nthe level of market acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers of services provided using our products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of research and development and other expenditures;\n\u00b7\ntiming of the receipt of orders from, and product shipments to, distributors and customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the distribution arrangements for our products;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing or supply delays;\n\u00b7\nthe time needed to educate and train additional sales and manufacturing personnel; and\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with defending our intellectual property.\nIn addition to these factors, expenditures are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe China JV exposes us to certain risks with respect to international trade, enforcement of intellectual property rights and political risks.\nAs a result of our involvement in the China JV, we are subject to a number of risks associated with conducting operations in China and other international markets, including:\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to manufacture, export the products of these companies or sell into particular jurisdictions or impose multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of tariffs, trade barriers and duties;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing geographically disparate operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements through non-U.S. legal systems, including the JV Agreement, which is governed under Chinese law;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, civil unrest or war;\n\u00b7\nterrorist activities that impact international commerce;\n\u00b7\noutbreaks of a pandemic disease, such as COVID-19 (coronavirus);\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in China and other countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the United States;\n\u00b7\nchanging laws and policies affecting economic liberalization, foreign investment, currency convertibility or exchange rates, taxation or employment; and\n\u00b7\nnationalization of foreign-owned assets, including intellectual property.\nInternational sales of our products account for a portion of our revenues, which will expose us to certain operating risks, and we intend to rely on international joint venture, particularly the China JV, for manufacturing and sales of our products in China and certain other Asian countries. If we are unable to successfully manage our international activities, our net sales, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur business currently depends in part on our activities in the EMEA, APAC, and other foreign markets. We also recently entered into the China JV and intend to rely on the China JV to manufacture and sell our products in the JV Territory. Our international activities are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include:\n\u00b7\nfailure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;\n\u00b7\nthe expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n\u00b7\nbuilding an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nchallenges caused by differences in legal regulations, markets, and customer preferences, which may limit our ability to adapt our products or succeed in other regions;\n\u00b7\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, foreign laws, tax schemes, international import and export legislation, trading and investment policies, exchange controls and tariff and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nforeign tax consequences;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and foreign currency translation adjustments;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nimposition of public sector controls;\n\u00b7\ndiffering payer reimbursement regimes, governmental payers or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and social instability; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology.\nSome of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business may establish legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nIn connection with our entry into the China JV for the manufacturing, sales and marketing of our products into China, we may be exposed to the additional risks of doing business in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China\u2019s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, anti-corruption, export control and environmental laws and regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or United States-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.\nIn addition to the foregoing, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of a health epidemic or widespread outbreak of a contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of the respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus strain (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, or any other outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments. These effects could include disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain, including those associated with our China JV. The significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak to us remains unclear at this time; however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Interruptions in production, in particular at any of the manufacturing facilities used to create our products, could increase our costs and reduce our sales.\nU.S. regulatory review may result in delays, restrictions or other adverse impacts on the operations of our China JV.\nIn connection with the China JV, the Joint Venture Partners and their affiliates agreed to purchase an aggregate of 3,067,485 shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to $1.63, for aggregate proceeds to us of $5.0 million (the \"JV Share Purchase\").\nIn February 2019, the Department of Defense, or the DOD, inquired about certain aspects of the China JV, including about our products\u2019 classification under U.S. export control regimes and whether the China JV parties intended to notify the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, of the China JV. In July 2019, the Treasury Department - as the chair of CFIUS - made similar inquiries about the China JV and the JV Share Purchase.\nCFIUS has broad discretion to assert jurisdiction to review foreign investments in U.S. businesses, and to restrict the ownership thereof and the transfer of technology therefrom to foreign investors, including where CFIUS believes that such foreign investment may present potential national security risks to the United States. CFIUS may take actions if CFIUS determines that the China JV and related investment are covered by its regulations and identifies any national security concerns with the transactions. CFIUS\u2019s actions could include the imposition of measures designed to mitigate and resolve any such national security concerns. Such mitigation measures may include, but not necessarily be limited to, a requirement that we obtain prior approval from the U.S. government to transfer certain technology related to our products, which would present a risk to the operations of the China JV. If CFIUS were to determine that it cannot mitigate any identified national security concerns, CFIUS could recommend that the President of the United States compel the China JV partners to abandon or unwind the China JV or the JV Share Purchase.\nIn December 2019, the Company and the China JV submitted a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS to review the transaction. CFIUS has determined that the establishment of the China JV is subject to CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction, and pending completion of its investigation, CFIUS imposed interim measures that temporarily suspend the Company\u2019s contributions to the China JV and other integration activities. The Company continues to engage with CFIUS to address its concerns, and expects CFIUS review and investigation, as well as its assessment of whether its concerns can be mitigated, to end by April 13, 2020.\nIn addition to CFIUS, and notwithstanding our views regarding the classifications of our products under U.S. export control regimes, the Department of Commerce has authority in certain circumstances under the Export Control Reform Act and the Export Administration Regulations to inform parties that a license is required to export items or technology to certain destinations, for reasons that include risk that the technology may be transferred for proscribed end uses. In the event the U.S. government exercises such authority over our products, it may delay and ultimately restrict our ability to transfer manufacturing technology to China JV.\nAny of the foregoing actions by the U.S. government could materially and adversely affect our China JV, and therefore, our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, then our international operations may not be successful, which could adversely affect our net sales, results of operations and financial condition and limit our growth.\nThe disruption or loss of relationships with vendors, suppliers and distributors for the components used in the manufacturing of our products or for sale and marketing of our products in certain territories could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with third-party vendors, suppliers and distributors. Although most of the raw materials that we use to manufacture our products are readily available from a number of suppliers, we generally procure raw materials and components through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of various components, if and as required in the future, may subject us to:\n\u00b7\ndelays in delivery or shortages in components that could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u00b7\nincreased component prices and supply delays as we establish alternative suppliers;\n\u00b7\ninability to develop alternative sources for product components;\n\u00b7\nrequired modifications of our products, which may cause delays in product shipments, increased manufacturing costs, and increased product prices; and\n\u00b7\nincreased inventory costs as we hold more inventory than we otherwise might in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance, which may result in write-offs if we are unable to use all such products in the future.\nIn addition, failure of any one supplier\u2019s components could result in a product recall, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows.\nWe are beginning the process of establishing a JV to streamline the supply chain for released products in China. If we are unable to build the local supply chains, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn non-German-speaking European countries, other EMEA countries and Central and South American countries, we rely on independent distributors to distribute and assist us with the marketing and sale of our products. These distributors are our principal customers, and revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and maintaining this sales and distribution channel. However, there can be no assurance that our distributors will be successful in selling our products to end users, or will focus adequate resources on selling them, and they may not continue to purchase or market our products for a number of reasons.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth and entry into new business areas.\nIf demand for our exoskeleton products exceeds our capacity to provide services timely and efficiently, then we may need to expand our operations accordingly and swiftly. Our management believes that establishing industry leadership will require us to:\n\u00b7\ntest, introduce and develop new products and services including enhancements to our existing products;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and expand the breadth of products and services offered;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and expand our market presence through relationships with third parties; and\n\u00b7\ngenerate satisfactory revenues from such expanded products or services to fund the foregoing requirements while obtaining and maintaining satisfactory profit margins.\nTo be able to expand our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner and increase the overall market acceptance of our products and services in this manner, we will need additional capital and technical and managerial human resources. These additional resources may not be available to us. Our failure to timely and efficiently expand our operations and successfully achieve the four requirements listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe acquisition of other companies, businesses, or technologies could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, any of which could be material to our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. In addition, integrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and integrating each company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management. The anticipated benefits of future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure\nOur operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects our foreign currency-denominated revenue. In the past, we have not hedged our exposures to foreign currencies or entered into any other derivative instruments and we have no current plans to do so. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange risk.\nNatural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, military conflict and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters are located in California, a seismically active region. A natural disaster in any of our major markets in North America or Europe could have a material adverse impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. Further, any unanticipated business disruption caused by Internet security threats, damage to global communication networks or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2005. Our net losses were $12.1 million and $27.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (with gains from a decrease on common stock purchase warrant liabilities due to a drop in our stock price accounting for a $6.4 million decrease on net losses in 2019). As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $183.3 million and $171.1 million, respectively. Our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding the same in its report to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative reactions to the price of our common stock and we may have\na more difficult time obtaining financing in the future.\nOur future profitability is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan. We can provide no assurance regarding when, if ever, we will become profitable. Even if we do become profitable, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Accordingly, we may continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and, in the extreme case, discontinue operations.\nWe will require significant additional financing to fund our operations and service our debt. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays and advance capital equipment expenditures and commitments. We will also need to repay or refinance approximately $2.8 million in outstanding indebtedness.\nWe have been largely dependent on capital raised through the sale of equity securities in various public and private offerings, and going forward will be largely dependent on capital raised in any future offerings to implement our business plan, support our operations and service our debt obligations.\nBased upon our current cash resources, the recent rate of using cash for operations and investment, and assuming modest increases in current revenue offset by incremental increases in expenses related to increased sales and marketing and research and development, and a potential increase in rental activity from our medical device business, we believe that we have sufficient resources to operate in compliance with our debt covenants until the end of the third quarter of 2020. We will require significant additional financing. We intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through public or private equity and/or debt financings, corporate collaborations, or warrant solicitations.\nWe anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working or growth capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, we may be subject to limitations on our ability to raise financing in private offerings as a result of volume limitations under Nasdaq rules with respect to sales of securities by Nasdaq-listed companies, as well as limitations on our ability to utilize our shelf registration on Form S-3 to raise financing in public or other registered offerings due to rules applicable to public companies with a public float below $75 million. If we are required to file a new registration statement on another form, we may incur additional costs and/or be subject to delays due to review by the SEC Staff. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely.\nAdditionally, our only loan agreement contains financial covenants, including a requirement of minimum cash on hand equivalent to three months of cash burn. Breach of covenants included in our loan agreement could result in the lenders demanding payment of the unpaid principal and interest balances. If we fail to pay any principal or interest under our indebtedness when due, or are otherwise in violation of financial covenants under our loan agreement, it may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business and would likely require us to seek to renegotiate the loan agreement with our lender or obtain a waiver from the lender, as we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness or to comply with our financial covenants. In the event that any such renegotiations are not successful or such waivers cannot be obtained on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may have to liquidate our assets at below-fair value prices, seek bankruptcy protection or implement other arrangements, any of which would or may be material adverse to our business, financial condition, assets and operations.\nWe may not be able to reduce the cost to manufacture or service our products as planned.\nOur business plan assumes that exoskeletons can be manufactured more inexpensively than they are currently being manufactured. However, we have not yet found a way to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of our products and doing so may prove more difficult than expected or even impossible. For example, if expectations for greater functionality of the products drive costs up as other factors drive costs down, the result may be that the overall cost of manufacturing the product stays the same or even increases. Likewise, we currently provide service and support of our products for our customers at a high standard (both in and out of warranty), and plan on continuing to do so. Our business plan also assumes that as we continue to improve our product, we achieve improved levels of product reliability and decreased service cost and frequency, which also may prove more difficult than expected.\nWe may not be able to leverage our cost structure or achieve better margins.\nDue to the early stage of our commercial efforts, and particularly the early stage of customer adoption of our products, our current sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses are each a higher percentage of sales than they will need to be for us to reach profitability. While we do expect these expenses to grow as our business grows, we also expect these expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time. If we are unable to leverage these costs and grow revenues at a greater pace than these operating expenses as we expect, we will not be able to achieve viable operating margins and profitability.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in our accounting policies or in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. The accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets and liabilities, and financial results. We may be required or determine that it is appropriate to change our accounting policies or the manner in which they are implemented as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. A change in applicable rules, their interpretation, or their application could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. This law includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. We are currently assessing the impact of this legislation, but currently anticipates no major short-term impact.\nIn addition, we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe may raise additional funds in the future through the issuances of equity securities or debt, which funding may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions on us.\nWe may need to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or the issuance of short- and long-term debt. If we raise additional funds by issuing shares of our common stock, our stockholders will experience dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing securities exercisable or convertible into shares of our common stock, our stockholders will experience dilution in the event the securities are exercised or converted, as the case may be, into shares of our common stock. Further, prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which existing stockholders purchased their shares, which may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. In addition, the terms of any new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders.\nDebt financing may involve agreements containing covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, issuing equity securities, making capital expenditures for certain purposes or above a certain amount, or declaring dividends. In addition, any equity securities or debt that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the securities held by our stockholders.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock may prevent us from making more difficult transactions, including a sale or merger.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of us. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage\nan attempt by a party to acquire control of us by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, we are required to:\n\u00b7\nmaintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7\nmaintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7\nprepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u00b7\ninstitute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u00b7\ninvolve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. We anticipate that these costs and compliance initiatives will increase as a result of the fact that we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as of December 31, 2017. In particular, we are now subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that had not been applicable to us as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nfull disclosure and analysis obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on our audit committee.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We previously reported a material weakness in our information technology general controls as of December 31, 2016, and as a result, determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2016.\nAs a natural course of business, management has, over the course of 2017 and 2018, been working to further strengthen our internal controls. Specifically, we have increased segregation of duties and implemented a more robust accounting and enterprise resource planning system (which became operational in October 2017). While we believe that the policies, processes and procedures we have put in place will be sufficient to render our internal controls over financial reporting effective, our initiatives may not prove successful and management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or\nregulations differently than we do, then (if required in the future) they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.\nDuring the period from our initial listing on Nasdaq on August 9, 2016 through December 31, 2019, the closing price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $6.21 per share to a low of $0.35 per share, and our stock price continues to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\nour ability to grow our revenue and customer base;\n\u00b7\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning regulatory oversight and approvals;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;\n\u00b7\nsuccesses or challenges in our collaborative arrangements or alternative funding sources;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in the rehabilitation and industrial robotics markets;\n\u00b7\nthe results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;\n\u00b7\nfuture issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u00b7\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nTrading of our common stock is limited, and trading restrictions imposed on us by applicable regulations may further reduce trading in our common stock, making it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares; and future sales of common stock could reduce our stock price.\nTrading of our common stock is currently conducted on Nasdaq. The liquidity of our common stock is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also as it may be adversely affected by delays in the timing of transactions and low coverage by research analysts\u2019 the media, if at all. These factors may result in different prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained in a more liquid market and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large public float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his or her investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future, if at all.\nSales by stockholders of substantial amounts of our shares of common stock, the issuance of new shares of common stock by us or the perception that these sales may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment in our common stock.\nOur stock price does not meet and may in the future fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 20, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Capital Market indicating that as of September 16, 2019 we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. We have been given a grace period of 180 days from the notification, or until March 16, 2020, to regain compliance, by having the closing bid price of our common stock exceed $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days during the grace period. If we do not regain compliance by March 16, 2020, we may be eligible for a second 180 day compliance period, provided that, on such date, we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable initial listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market (other than the minimum closing bid price requirement) and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nThere is no assurance, however, that we will regain compliance during the grace period or be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance during the grace period, or any extension of the grace period for which we may be eligible, Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock will be suspended and subject to delisting. If we are subject to delisting, we may appeal Nasdaq\u2019s determination to delist to a hearings panel. During any appeal process, shares of our common stock would continue to trade on Nasdaq. If our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws with respect to shares issued in future offerings, greater difficulty in obtaining financing, potential loss of confidence by employees, loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.", "PERMNO": 16252, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "EKSO"}
