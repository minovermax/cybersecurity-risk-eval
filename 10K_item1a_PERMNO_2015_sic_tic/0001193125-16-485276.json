{"cik": "1645494", "company": "ARRIS International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is dependent on customers\u2019 capital spending on broadband communication systems, and reductions by customers in capital spending would adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is primarily dependent on customers\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading broadband communications systems. Capital spending in the broadband communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect capital spending, and, therefore, our sales and profits, including:\n\u2022\ndemands for network services;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other providers of broadband and high-speed services;\n\u2022\ncustomer specific financial or stock market conditions;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new services offered; and\n\u2022\nreal or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors.\nIndex to Financial Statements Several of our customers have accumulated significant levels of debt. These high debt levels, coupled with the volatility in the capital markets, may impact their access to capital in the future. Even if the financial health of our customers\u2019 remains intact, these customers may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past or expect in the future. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of any softening or downturn in the national or global economy or of specific customer financial challenges on our customer\u2019s expansion and maintenance expenditures.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the recently completed Pace acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.\nOur ability to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the recently completed Pace acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate the Pace businesses with our historic operations. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of ARRIS and Pace. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the overall integration of the Pace business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects expected from the transaction;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, and decreases in the amount of expected revenues, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of the Pace are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the combination, including the potential synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all, or additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effects of the transaction, or negatively impact the trading price of our ordinary shares. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the combination of the ARRIS and Pace businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.\nOur effective tax rates, which generally are expected to decrease as a result of the transaction, are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in jurisdictions in which the combined business operates, the financial performance of the combined business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies, including changes in interest rates, and changes in U.S. tax laws, UK tax laws and the tax laws of the other jurisdictions in which we do business. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be interrelated, and the impact to the combined company of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.\nIndex to Financial Statements The market in which we operate is intensely competitive, and competitive pressures may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe markets in which we participate are dynamic, highly competitive and require companies to react quickly and capitalize on change. We must retain skilled and experienced personnel, as well as deploy substantial resources to meet the changing demands of the industry and must be nimble to be able to capitalize on change. We compete with international, national and regional manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers including some companies that are larger than we are. We list our major competitors in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d.\nIn some instances, our customers themselves may be our competition. Some of our customers may develop their own software requiring support within our products and/or may design and develop products of their own which are produced to their own specifications directly by a contract manufacturer. The rapid technological changes occurring in broadcast and broadband communications industry may lead to the entry of new competitors, including those with substantially greater resources than our own. Because the market in which we compete is characterized by rapid growth and, in some cases, low barriers to entry, smaller companies and start-up ventures also may become principal competitors in the future. Actions by existing competitors and the entry of new competitors may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In the future, technological advances could lead to the obsolescence of some of our current products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, several of our larger competitors may be in a better position to withstand any significant, sustained reduction in capital spending by customers. They often have broader product lines and segment focus and therefore are not as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. In addition, several of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have, and therefore have more established relationships with customers.\nConsolidations in the broadcast and broadband communication systems industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe broadcast and broadband communication systems industry has historically experienced, and continues to experience, the consolidation of many industry participants. For example, Charter Communications, Inc. has announced its intention to acquire Time Warner Cable, AT&T recently completed its acquisition of DIRECTV, Verizon Communications Inc. announced that it is selling certain wireline businesses to Frontier Communications Corp., which transaction is expected to close in March 2016, and Altice recently completed its acquisition of Suddenlink and has announced its intention to acquire Cablevision. When consolidations occur, it is possible that the acquirer will not continue using the same suppliers, possibly resulting in an immediate or future elimination of sales opportunities for us. Even if sales are not reduced, consolidations also could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the affected companies prior to completion of the transaction. Further, even if we believe we will receive additional sales from a customer following a transaction as a result of typical network upgrades that following combinations or otherwise, no assurance can be provided that such anticipated sales will be realized. In addition, consolidations can also result in increased pressure from customers for lower prices or better terms, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProposed FCC regulations for the broadband communications industry could significantly impact our operations.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) has adopted new \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that, among other things, subject Internet service providers to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. These regulations have been challenged in federal court. In addition, the FCC recently proposed new rules designed to impose new technology mandates on multichannel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) that would include many of our customers aimed at enabling retail video devices to access MVPD services without the need for an operator-supplied set-top box. If implemented, such mandates could result in our customers reducing their investment in their networks and in the development and deployment of\nIndex to Financial Statements\nnew set-top boxes. A significant reduction in their capital expenditures as a result of any such regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have significant indebtedness, which could limit our operations and opportunities, make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts and/or may cause us to issue additional equity in the future, which would increase the dilution of our stockholders or reduce earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,540.0 million in total indebtedness, and we incurred approximately $800.0 million in additional indebtedness to fund the Pace acquisition in January 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had a $497.9 million available under our revolving line of credit to support our working capital needs. Our debt service obligations with respect to this indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows for as long as the indebtedness is outstanding.\nThis significant indebtedness could also have important consequences to stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since the majority of our debt is subject to variable rates.\nBased upon current levels of operations, we expect to be able to generate sufficient cash on a consolidated basis to make all of the principal and interest payments when such payments are due under our senior secured credit facilities; but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance such borrowings and obligations.\nWe may consider it appropriate to reduce the amount of indebtedness currently outstanding. This may be accomplished in several ways, including issuing additional ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares, reducing discretionary uses of cash or a combination of these and other measures. Issuances of additional ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares would have the effect of diluting the ownership percentage that stockholders will hold in the company and may reduce our reported earnings per share.\nWe face risks relating to currency fluctuations and currency exchange.\nOn an ongoing basis we are exposed to various changes in foreign currency rates because certain sales are denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, certain intercompany transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and subject to revaluation. These changes can impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective. In addition, many of our international customers make purchases from us that are denominated in U.S dollars. As we have seen the U.S. dollar strengthen, it has impacted these customers\u2019 ability to purchase products. For example, based on the foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the value of the Brazilian real, the Argentine peso and the Mexican peso decreased approximately 49%, 53% and 18% against the U.S. dollar, respectively, which significantly impacted purchases by our customers in these countries in 2015. Further strengthening could have a material impact on our sales in the affected countries.\nIndex to Financial Statements We also may encounter difficulties in converting our earnings from international operations to U.S. dollars for use in the United States. These obstacles may include problems moving funds out of the countries in which the funds were earned and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries where the usual accounts receivable payment cycle is longer.\nWe may have difficulty in forecasting our sales and may experience volatility in revenues.\nBecause a significant portion of our customer\u2019s purchases are discretionary, accurately forecasting our sales is difficult. In addition, our customers in recent years have submitted their purchase orders less evenly over the course of each quarter and year, and with shorter lead times than they have historically. The combination of our dependence on relatively few key customers and the award by those customers of irregular but sizeable contracts, together with the size of our operations, make it difficult to forecast sales and can result in revenue volatility, which could further result in maintaining inventory levels that are too high or too low for our ultimate needs and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe broadcast and broadband communications system industry on which our business is focused is significantly impacted by technological change.\nThe broadcast and broadband communication systems industry has gone through dramatic technological change resulting in service providers rapidly migrating their business from a one-way television service to a two-way communications network enabling multiple services, such as residential and business high-speed Internet access, residential and business telephony services, digital television, video on demand and advertising services. New services, such as home security, power monitoring and control, 3-D and 4K (UHD) television that are or may be offered by service providers, are also based on, and will be characterized by, rapidly evolving technology. The development of increasing transmission speed, density and bandwidth for Internet traffic has also enabled the provision of high quality, feature length video over the Internet. This over-the-top IP video service enables content providers such as Netflix and Hulu, programmers such as HBO and ESPN and portals like Google to provide video services on-demand, by-passing traditional video service providers. The Chairman of the FCC has also announced his intention to have the FCC adopt new regulations to facilitate the ability of over-the-top services to compete against traditional multichannel video programming providers. As these service providers enhance their quality and scalability, traditional providers are introducing similar services over their existing networks, as well as over-the-top IP video for delivery not only to televisions but to computers, tablets, and telephones in order to remain competitive. Our business is dependent on our ability to develop products that enable current and new customers to exploit these rapid technological changes. We believe the continued growth of over-the-top IP video represents a shift from the traditional video delivery paradigm. To the extent that we are unable to adapt our technologies to serve this emerging demand, including obtaining necessary certifications from content providers and programmers to include their over-the-top video applications as part of our product offerings, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe continued industry move to open standards may impact our future results.\nThe broadcast and broadband communication systems industry has and will continue to demand products based on open standards. The move toward open standards, including the FCC\u2019s proposed rules, is expected to increase both the number of service providers that will offer services to the market. This trend is also expected to increase the number of competitors who are able to supply products to service providers and drive down the capital costs per subscriber deployed. These factors may adversely impact both our future revenues and margins. In addition, many of our customers participate in \u201ctechnology pools\u201d and increasingly request that we donate a portion of our source code used by the customer to these pools which may impact our ability to recapture the R&D investment made in developing such code.\nWe believe that we will be increasingly required to work with third party technology providers. As a result, we expect the shift to more open standards may require us to license software and other components indirectly to third parties via various open source licenses. In some circumstances, ARRIS\u2019s use of such open source technology may include technology or protocols developed by standards settings bodies, other industry forums or third\nIndex to Financial Statements\nparty companies. The terms of the open source licenses granted by such parties may limit our ability to commercialize products that utilize such technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe no longer have use of the \u201cMotorola\u201d brand name.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Motorola Home, we were granted the right, subject to certain conditions, to continue to use the Motorola brand name on certain products. Our right to use the Motorola brand name ended at the end of 2015 and use of the brand name for products similar to products that we sell in the retail channel has been licensed to a competitor of ours. Shelf space in retail outlets can be impacted by how recognizable a brand is by customers. If our rebranding of those products is not successful, or if use of the Motorola brand by a competitor causes confusion amongst customers, our retail sales may decrease. Further, the loss of the use of the \u201cMotorola\u201d brand may result in a lower amount of shelf space, or space in less desirable areas, which may impact our sales.\nOur business is concentrated in a few key customers. The loss of any of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to our two largest customers (including their affiliates, as applicable) accounted for approximately 35.3% of our total revenue. While we will have less customer concentration as a result of the Pace acquisition, sales to some customers are expected to significantly increase. The loss of any of our large customers, or a significant reduction in the products or services provided to any of them would have a material adverse impact on our business. For many of these customers, we also are one of their largest suppliers. As a result, if from time-to-time customers elect to purchase products from our competitors in order to diversify their supplier base and to dual-source key products or to curtail purchasing due to budgetary or market conditions, such decisions could have material consequences to our business. In addition, because of the magnitude of our sales to these customers the terms and timing of our sales are heavily negotiated, and even minor changes can have a significant impact upon our business.\nWe may face higher costs associated with protecting our intellectual property or obtaining necessary access to the intellectual property of others.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology, product development, technological expertise and distribution channels, in addition to a number of important patents and licenses. We cannot predict whether we can protect our technology or whether competitors will be able to develop similar technology independently and such technology could be subject to challenge, unlawful copying or other unfair competitive practices. Given the dependence on technology within the market in which we complete, there are frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have received, directly or indirectly, and expect to continue to receive, from third parties, including some of our competitors, notices claiming that we, or our customers using our products, have infringed upon third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We are involved in several proceedings (and other proceedings have been threatened) in which our customers were sued for patent infringement. (See Part II, Item 1, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) In these cases our customers have made claims against us and other suppliers for indemnification. We may become involved in similar litigation involving these and other customers in the future, including as a result of the Pace acquisition. These claims, regardless of their merit, could result in costly litigation, divert the time, attention and resources of our management, delay our product shipments, and, in some cases, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. If a claim of patent infringement against us or our customer is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop non-infringing technology, we or our customer may be prohibited from marketing or selling products containing the infringing technology which could materially affect our business and operating results. In addition, the payment of any damages or any necessary licensing fees or indemnification costs associated with a patent infringement claim could be material and could also materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIndex to Financial Statements We have substantial goodwill and amortizable intangible assets.\nOur financial statements reflect substantial goodwill and intangible assets, approximately $1,014.0 million and $810.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, that was recognized in connection with prior acquisitions and we expect to record significant additional goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the Pace acquisition.\nWe annually (and more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired) review the carrying amount of our goodwill in order to determine whether it has been impaired for accounting purposes. In general, if the fair value of the corresponding reporting unit is less that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we record an impairment. The determination of fair value is dependent upon a number of factors, including assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates that are based on our current and long-term business plans. With respect to the amortizable intangible assets, we test recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited to, operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets. If we determine that an asset or asset group is not recoverable, then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections would represent management\u2019s best estimates at the time of the impairment review.\nWhile no goodwill or intangible asset impairments were recorded in 2015 or 2014, as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our remaining goodwill and intangible assets are assessed, changes in the economic conditions, changes to our business strategy, changes in operating performance or other indicators of impairment could cause us to realize impairment charges in the future, including as a result of restructuring undertaken in connection with the integration of the former Pace operations during 2016. For additional information, see the discussion under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPace was not subject to the internal controls and other compliance obligations of the U.S. securities laws, and we may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures over Pace operations as required under the U.S. securities laws.\nPace was not subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and other U.S. federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations relating to, among other things, the maintenance of a system of internal controls as contemplated by the Exchange Act. We will need to timely and effectively implement the internal controls necessary to satisfy those requirements, which require an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We intend to take appropriate measures to establish or implement an internal control environment at Pace aimed at successfully fulfilling these requirements. However, it is possible that we may experience delays in implementing or be unable to implement the required internal financial reporting controls and procedures, which could result in enforcement actions, the assessment of penalties and civil suits, failure to meet reporting obligations and other material and adverse events that could have a negative effect on the market price for our ordinary shares.\nThe Pace acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that the Pace acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings per share in 2016 and thereafter. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. We may encounter additional integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition or be subject to other factors that adversely affect preliminary estimates. Any of these factors could cause delay or significantly reduce the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and contribute to a decrease in the trading price of our stock.\nIndex to Financial Statements The IRS may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAlthough, following the Pace transaction, we are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and are a tax resident in the United Kingdom for UK tax purposes, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, we generally would be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) however, provides an exception to this general rule under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nGenerally, for us to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874, the former stockholders of ARRIS must own (within the meaning of Section 7874) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of all of the outstanding shares of ARRIS International (the \u201cOwnership Test\u201d). Based on the terms of the Pace transaction, we believe historic ARRIS stockholders do own less than 80% of all of the outstanding shares in ARRIS International and, thus, the Ownership Test has been satisfied. However, ownership for purposes of Section 7874 is subject to various adjustments under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and there is limited guidance regarding the Section 7874 provisions, including regarding the application of the Ownership Test. Thus, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position that the Ownership Test was satisfied following the Pace transaction and/or would not successfully challenge the status of ARRIS International as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. taxes. For UK tax purposes, we are expected, regardless of any application of Section 7874, to be treated as a UK tax resident. Consequently, if we are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874, we could be liable for both U.S. and UK taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur status as a foreign corporation for U.S. tax purposes could be affected by a change in law.\nUnder current law, we expect to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, changes to Section 7874 or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or other changes in law, could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our effective tax rate and/or future tax planning, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us and our stockholders.\nRecent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of Section 7874, or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with so-called inversion transactions. For example, proposals introduced by certain members of both houses of the U.S. Congress that, if enacted in their present form, would be effective retroactively to any transactions completed after May 8, 2014 would, among other things, treat a foreign acquiring corporation as a U.S. corporation under Section 7874 if the former stockholders of the U.S. corporation own more than 50% (by vote or value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction. These proposals, if enacted in their present form and if made retroactively effective, would cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is presently uncertain whether any such legislative proposals or any other legislation relating to Section 7874 or so-called inversion transactions will be enacted into law and, if so, what impact such legislation would have on us.\nIn addition, the U.S. Treasury has indicated that it is considering regulatory action in connection with so-called inversion transactions. The specific timing and substance of any such action is presently uncertain. The regulations described in notices issued by the U.S. Treasury would, among other things, make it more difficult for the Ownership Test to be satisfied and would limit or eliminate certain tax benefits to so-called inverted corporations, including with respect to access to certain foreign earnings and/or the ability to restructure the non-U.S. members of the group. Although the promulgation of the Treasury Regulations described in the recently issued Treasury notices is not expected to materially affect our tax status, the precise scope and application of\nIndex to Financial Statements\nthese regulatory proposals will not be clear until proposed Treasury Regulations are actually issued. Accordingly, until such regulations are promulgated and fully understood, we cannot be certain that such regulations would not have an adverse impact on us. Moreover, the notice also indicate that the U.S. Treasury and the IRS are considering issuing additional guidance, which in the case of \u201cinverted groups\u201d would be retroactive, to address certain transactions that have the effect of \u201cshifting\u201d U.S.-source earnings to lower-tax jurisdictions, including by limiting U.S. tax deductions for interest on certain intercompany debt obligations. Any such future guidance could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nSection 7874 of the Code may limit our ability to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes.\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset, during the ten-year period following the acquisition, their U.S. taxable income, or related income tax liability, resulting from certain (a) transfers to related foreign persons of stock or other properties of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates and (b) income received or accrued from related foreign persons during such period by reason of a license of any property by the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates (collectively, \u201cinversion gain\u201d). Based on the limited guidance available and as a result of the Pace transaction, we believe that this limitation under Section 7874 will apply and, as a result, we do not currently expect that the Company or its U.S. affiliates will be able to utilize certain U.S. tax attributes to reduce the amount of any inversion gain and/or to offset applicable U.S. federal income tax liability attributable to any inversion, but may continue to be used to reduce our taxable income from ordinary operations.\nProducts currently under development may fail to realize anticipated benefits.\nRapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles characterize the markets for our products. The technology applications that we currently are developing are subject to technological, supply chain, product development and other related risks that could delay successful delivery. The market in which we operate is subject to a rapid rate of technological change, reflected in increased development and manufacturing complexity and increasingly demanding customer requirements, all of which can result in unforeseen delivery problems. Even if the products in development are successfully brought to market, they may be late, may not be widely used or we may not be able to capitalize successfully on the developed technology. To compete successfully, we must quickly design, develop, manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability. However, we may not be able to develop or introduce these products successfully if such products:\n\u2022\nare not cost-effective;\n\u2022\nare not brought to market in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nfail to achieve market acceptance; or\n\u2022\nfail to meet industry certification standards.\nFurthermore, our competitors may develop similar or alternative technologies that, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on us. Our strategic alliances are generally based on business relationships that have not been the subject of written agreements expressly providing for the alliance to continue for a significant period of time and the loss of any such strategic relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDefects within our products could have a material impact on our results.\nMany of our products are complex technology that include both hardware and software components. It is not unusual for software, especially in earlier versions, to contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. While we employ rigorous testing prior to the shipment of our products, defects, including those resulting from components we purchase, may still occur from time to time. Product defects, including hardware\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfailures, could impact our reputation with our customers which may result in fewer sales. In addition, depending on the number of products affected, the cost of fixing or replacing such products could have a material impact on our operating results. In some cases, we are dependent on a sole supplier for components used in our products. Defects in sole-sourced components subject us to additional risk of being able to quickly address any product issues or failures experienced by our customers as a result of the component defect and could delay our ability to deliver new products until the defective components are corrected or a new supplier is identified and qualified. This could increase our costs in resolving the product issue, result in decreased sales of the impacted product, or damage our reputation with customers, any of which could have the effect of negatively impacting our operating results.\nHardware or software defects could also permit unauthorized users to gain access to our customers\u2019 networks and/or a consumer\u2019s home network. In addition to potentially damaging our reputation with customers, such defects may also subject us to claims for damages under agreements with our customers and subject us to fines by regulatory authorities.\nWe offer warranties of various lengths to our customers on many of our products and have established warranty reserves based on, among other things, our historic experience, failure rates and cost to repair. In the event of a significant non-recurring product failure, the amount of the warranty reserve may not be sufficient. From time to time we may also make repairs on defects that occur outside of the provided warranty period. Such costs would not be covered by the established reserves and, depending on the volume of any such repairs, may have a material adverse effect on our results from operations or financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all facets of our operations.\nCompetition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel, which could impact our ability to maintain and grow our operations. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our management to operate effectively. In the past, competitors and others have attempted to recruit our employees and their attempts may continue. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and other technical professionals, could negatively affect our business.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and inability to obtain adequate and timely delivery of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany components, subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Likewise, we have only a limited number of potential suppliers for certain materials and hardware used in our products and a number of our agreements with suppliers are short-term in nature. Our reliance on sole or limited suppliers, particularly foreign suppliers, and our reliance on subcontractors involves several risks including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, subassemblies, modules and other materials and reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery of components, subassemblies, modules and other products. An inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship products on a timely basis which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to ship products could also be impacted by country laws and/or union labor disruptions. For example the labor dispute involving union dock workers at certain U.S. west coast port facilities, in many cases, greatly increased the shipping time for our products arriving through the affected ports and also increase our shipping costs as we had to increase the number of products shipped using air freight which is significantly more expensive. Disputes of this nature may have a material impact on our financial results.\nIndex to Financial Statements We are subject to the economic, political and social instability risks associated with doing business in certain foreign countries.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 28.7% of our sales were made outside of the United States. In addition, a significant portion of our products are manufactured or assembled in China, Mexico and Taiwan. As a result, we are exposed to risk of international operations, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ninflexible employee contracts or labor laws in the event of business downturns;\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States and foreign laws concerning trade and employment practices;\n\u2022\nthe challenges inherent in consistently maintaining compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of government controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining or complying with export license requirements;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest, including strikes, and difficulties in staffing;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns;\n\u2022\neconomic boycott for doing business in certain countries;\n\u2022\ncoordinating communications among and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax and trade laws that increase our local costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to heightened corruption risks; and\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights.\nPolitical instability and military and terrorist activities may have significant impacts on our customers\u2019 spending in these regions and can further enhance many of the risks identified above. Any of these risks could impact our sales, interfere with the operation of our facilities and result in reduced production, increased costs, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe depend on channel partners to sell our products in certain regions and are subject to risks associated with these arrangements.\nWe utilize distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products to certain customers and in certain geographic regions to improve our access to these customers and regions and to lower our overall cost of sales and post-sales support. Our sales through channel partners are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nability of our selected channel partners to effectively sell our products to end customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue channel partner arrangements into the future since most are for a limited term and subject to mutual agreement to extend;\n\u2022\na reduction in gross margins realized on sale of our products; and\n\u2022\na diminution of contact with end customers which, over time, could adversely impact our ability to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\nThe import of our products is subject to trade regulations.\nThe import of our products into the United States and certain other countries is subject to the trade regulations in the countries where they are imported. Products may be subject to customs\u2019 duties that we pay to the applicable government agency and then collect from our customers in connection with the sale of the imported\nIndex to Financial Statements\nproducts. The amount of the customs duty owed, if any, is based on classification of the products within the applicable customs regulations. While we believe that our products have been properly classified, the U.S. Customs Agency or other applicable foreign regulatory agencies, may challenge our classifications and the amount of any duty payable. For example, we currently have a case pending in the U.S. Court of International Trade regarding the challenge by the U.S. Customs Agency with respect to certain digital television adapters that we import into the United States and believe are duty free. If it is ultimately determined that a product has been misclassified for customs purposes, we may be required to pay additional duties for products previously imported and we may not be successful in collecting the increased duty from the customer that purchased the products. In addition, we could be required to pay interest and/or fines to the applicable regulator, which amounts could be significant and negatively impact our results of operations. Further, if we do not comply with the applicable trade regulations, delivery of products to customers may be delayed which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur ordinary shares currently are traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. The trading price of our shares has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. Our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors including:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning us, key customers or competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to technology or litigation;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions and financings.\nFluctuations in the stock market, generally, also impact the volatility of our stock price. General stock market movements may adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, damaging our reputation or exposing us to liability.\nWe receive, process, store and transmit, often electronically, the confidential data of our clients and others. Unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of confidential information, the deletion or modification of records or could cause interruptions in our operations. These cyber-security risks increase when we transmit information from one location to another, including transmissions over the Internet or other electronic networks. Despite implemented security measures, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events which may disrupt our delivery of services or expose the confidential information of our clients and others.\nIn addition, defects in the hardware or software we develop and sell could also result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 and/or consumers\u2019 networks. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information of our customers or others, whether by us or a third party, could (i) subject us to civil and criminal penalties, (ii) have a negative impact on our reputation, or (iii) expose us to liability to our customers, third parties or government authorities. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have not experienced any such incidents that have had material consequences to date. We expect the U.S. and other countries to adopt additional cyber-security legislation that, if enacted, could impose additional obligations upon us that may negatively impact our operating results.\nIndex to Financial Statements New regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us\nWe are subject to the SEC disclosure obligations relating to our use of so-called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d - columbite-tantalite, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (tungsten) and gold. These minerals are present in substantially all of our products. We are required to file a report with the SEC annually covering our use of these materials and their source.\nIn preparing these reports, we are dependent upon information supplied by suppliers of products that contain, or potentially contain, conflict minerals. To the extent that the information that we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining that information do not fulfill the SEC\u2019s requirements, we could face reputational risks. Further, if in the future we are unable to certify that our products are conflict mineral free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our credit facilities. Payment of dividends in the future will depend on, among other things, business conditions, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nAs a result of shareholder voting requirements in the United Kingdom relative to Delaware, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than we had as a Delaware corporation.\nPrior to the Pace transaction, we were incorporated under Delaware law, which allowed our directors to authorize the issuance, without stockholder approval or any preemptive rights, of any shares authorized by our certificate of incorporation that were not already issued. Under English law, our directors may issue new ordinary shares up to a maximum amount equal to the allotment authority granted to the directors under our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, subject to a five year limit on such authority. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, English law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to waive these rights by way of a special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares or generally, subject to a five-year limit on such waiver. Our articles of association contain, as permitted by English law, a provision authorizing our Board to issue new shares for cash without preemptive rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares without further shareholder approval and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations always will be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and, thereby, adversely affect the holders of our ordinary shares. While we do not believe that the differences between Delaware law and English law relating to our capital management will have a material adverse effect on us, situations may arise where the flexibility had under Delaware law would have provided benefits to our shareholders that is not be available under English law.\nAny attempted takeovers of us will be governed by English law.\nAs a UK incorporated company, we are subject to English law. An English public limited company is potentially subject to the protections afforded by the Takeover Code if, among other factors, a majority of its directors are resident within the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. We do not believe that the Takeover Code applies to us, and, as a result, our articles of association include measures similar to what may be found in the charters of U.S. companies, including the power for our Board to allot shares where in the opinion of the Board it is necessary to do so in the context of an acquisition of 20% or more of the issued voting shares in specified circumstances (this power is subject to renewal by our shareholders at least every five years and will cease to be applicable if the Takeover Code is subsequently deemed by the Takeover Panel to be applicable to ARRIS. Further, it could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are\nIndex to Financial Statements\ngreater, under English law than under Delaware law. The provisions of our articles of association and English law may have an anti-takeover impact on us and our ordinary shares.\nTransfers of our ordinary shares, other than one effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), may be subject to UK stamp duty.\nAll of our outstanding shares are currently represented by book-entry interests in DTC. Transfers of our ordinary shares within DTC should not be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) provided no instrument of transfer is entered into and no election that applies to our ordinary shares is made or has been made by DTC or Cede under Section 97A FA 1986. In this regard DTC has confirmed that neither DTC nor Cede (its nominee) has made an election under section 97A of the Finance Act which would affect our shares issued to Cede, as part of the Pace transaction. If such an election is or has been made, transfers of our ordinary shares within DTC generally will be subject to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration. Transfers of our ordinary shares held in certificated form generally will be subject to stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration given (rounded up to the nearest \u00a35). SDRT will also be chargeable on an agreement to transfer such shares, although such liability would be discharged if stamp duty is duly paid on the instrument of transfer implementing such agreement within a period of six years from the agreement. Subsequent transfer of our ordinary shares to an issuer of depository receipts or into a clearance system (including DTC) may be subject to SDRT at a rate of 1.5% of the consideration given or received or, in certain cases, the value of our ordinary shares transferred. The purchaser or transferee of the ordinary shares generally will be responsible for paying any stamp duty or SDRT payable.\nIf the UK were to exit from the European Union, our business could suffer a material adverse effect.\nThe UK recently announced that it will hold a referendum on June 23, 2016 related to its continued membership in the European Union. This referendum could introduce potentially significant new uncertainties and instability in financial and trade markets, both ahead of the date for any such referendum and, depending on the outcome, after the referendum.\nGiven the lack of precedent, it is unclear how a potential withdrawal of the UK from the European Union would affect the UK\u2019s access to the EU Single Market and other important financial and trade relationships and how it would affect us. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the European Union. Under current European Union rules, following a withdrawal the UK would not be able to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with member countries of the European Union. In addition, a withdrawal of the UK from the European Union could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape within the UK and could have a material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries, including the broadcast and broadband communication systems industry in which we operate. Although it is not possible to predict fully the effects of a withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, if it were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79564, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "ARRS"}
