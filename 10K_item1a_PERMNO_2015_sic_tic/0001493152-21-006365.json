Risk Factors\nPandemic-Related Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies as well as the markets we serve. It has affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the U.S. and in various parts of the world and has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. We have been and continue to be unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, the nature and length of actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate its impact, the severity and duration of the economic impact caused by the pandemic, the uncertainty surrounding possible treatments and rollout of vaccines, along with the effectiveness of our response. Our compliance with containment and mitigation measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and is expected to continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, at least through the third quarter of 2021.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, since approximately March 16, 2020, all of our non-essential employees have been working remotely. This represents approximately two thirds of our workforce. The increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing, business email compromise and other cybersecurity attacks, including increased introduction of malware, as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), also has increased our risks of cybersecurity attacks or incidents, and any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure, may adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we understand that the employees of many of our customers are working remotely, which may delay the timing of some orders as well as shipments and cash collections. The disruptions to our operations caused by COVID-19 have resulted in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. Significant uncertainties remain around sales, cash collections, costs related to our COVID-19 mediation efforts and costs and timing related to anticipated easing of shelter-in-place and shut-down orders going forward into the remainder of the fiscal year 2021.\nMore generally, the pandemic has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in an extended global economic downturn, causing volatility in financial markets, which has affected and is expected to continue to affect demand for our products and services and impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic is contained and the shelter-in-place orders are lifted. For example, we may be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by COVID-19. Decreases or delays in orders in a given period have and are expected to continue to negatively affect our revenues in future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending on data and communication networks by customers or end users of our products, and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 or end users\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile or hard to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of capital spending, and therefore, our revenues and profits, including:\n\u25cf competing technologies;\n\u25cf timing and adoption of global rollout of new technologies, including LTE/5G;\n\u25cf customer specific financial or market conditions;\n\u25cf governmental budget levels and regulation;\n\u25cf demand for network services; and\n\u25cf acceptance of new services offered by our customers.\nOur customers or the end users of our products may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past or expect in the future. Accordingly, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on the deployment of 4G LTE and 5G NR private networks and related services to grow our business, and our business may be harmed if our customers are unsuccessful in the deployment of 4G LTE and 5G NR private networks or if they deploy technologies that are not supported by our solutions.\nWe depend on the deployment of 4G LTE and 5G NR wireless private networks which are supported by our CommAgility software licenses and services. Deployment of private networks in support of industrial internet of things (\u201cIOT\u201d) networks, satellite communications, transportation networks and air to ground networks requires significant capital expenditure by customers. If new deployments of 4G LTE or 5G NR private networks are delayed because of a lack of capital or other issues, or if we are unsuccessful in winning new projects for deployment of 4G LTE and 5G NR private networks, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe cyclicality of our end-user markets could harm our financial results.\nMany of the end markets we serve, including but not limited to the commercial wireless market, have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns. The factors leading to and the severity and length of a downturn are very difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will appropriately anticipate changes in the underlying end markets we serve or that any increased levels of business activity will continue as a trend into the future. If we fail to anticipate changes in the end markets we serve, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we are not able to successfully compete, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.\nWe operate in industries characterized by aggressive competition, rapid technological change, evolving technology standards and short product life cycles. Current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology and performance.\nWe also compete on price. That competition comes from smaller offshore vendors with significantly lower costs and expenses as well as larger companies which have substantially greater resources and expertise in financial, technical and marketing areas than we have. The emergence of smaller offshore vendors has created a highly competitive pricing environment specifically for Microlab. Our competitors may introduce products that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop, market and sell new and enhanced products at competitive prices, which will require significant research and development expenditures. If we do not develop new and enhanced products or if we are not able to invest adequately in our research and development activities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets. They often have broader product lines and market focus and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide. To the extent large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with us choose to enter our markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments which could cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and harm our business and results of operations.\nOn February 7, 2020 we acquired Holzworth Instrumentation, Inc., a company based in Denver, Colorado. Additionally, in the future we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. The Holzworth acquisition and future acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u25cf implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies of the acquired company;\n\u25cf failure to commercialize purchased technology;\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes, escheat and tax and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods.\nIf we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with any future acquisition or investment, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition or investment and we could incur unanticipated costs, liabilities or otherwise suffer harm to our business generally. The difficulties and challenges of successful integration of any acquired company are increased when the integration involves companies with operations or material vendors outside the United States.\nTo the extent that we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash or any potential cash earn outs, it has reduced and may in the future reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. Such payments also may increase our cash flow and liquidity risk and could result in increased borrowings under our Credit Facility. See the Risk Factor titled \u201cOur degree of leverage could prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and expose us to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt.\u201d Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or impairment charges against goodwill or intangible assets on our balance sheet, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and to adapt to technological changes and to develop, implement and market product innovations.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require ongoing improvements in the capabilities of our products. However, we may not be successful in our ongoing improvement efforts if, among other things, our products:\n\u25cf are not cost effective;\n\u25cf are not brought to market in a timely manner;\n\u25cf are not in accordance with evolving industry standards; or\n\u25cf fail to achieve market acceptance or meet customer requirements.\nThere are various competitive wireless technologies that could be a substitute for the products we sell. The failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis or the inability to continue to market existing products on a cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, revenues from new products may replace revenues from some of our existing products, mitigating the benefits of new product introductions and possibly resulting in excess levels of inventory.\nFurthermore, we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept. We must accurately forecast volumes, mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed. If we do not succeed, we may be left with inventories of obsolete products or we may not have enough of some products available to meet customer demand, which could lead to reduced revenues and higher expenses.\nOur revenues are dependent in part on commercial upgrades of 4G and 5G wireless communications equipment, products and services. Our business may be harmed, and our investments in our technologies may not provide us an adequate return if:\n\u25cf wireless operators delay moving customers to 4G or 5G devices;\n\u25cf wireless operators delay 4G or 5G deployments, expansions or upgrades;\n\u25cf government regulators delay the reallocation of spectrum to allow wireless operators to upgrade to 4G or 5G, which will restrict the expansion of 4G or 5G wireless connectivity;\n\u25cf wireless operators are unable to drive improvements in 4G or 5G network performance and/or capacity;\n\u25cf wireless operators and other industries using these technologies deploy other technologies; or\n\u25cf wireless operators choose to spend their capital on their core network or limit their expenditures on radio access network (RAN).\nOur business is dependent on our ability to increase our share of components sold and to continue to drive the adoption of our products and services into LTE, 4G and 5G wireless networks. If commercial deployment of our technologies, and upgrade of subscribers to 4G or 5G wireless communications equipment, products and services using our technologies do not continue or are delayed, our revenues could be negatively impacted, and our business could suffer.\nFurther, if we do not have competitively priced, market accepted products available to meet the wireless operators planned roll-out of 5G wireless communications systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOperational Risks\nOur future research and development projects might not be successful.\nThe successful development of telecommunications products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to be promising at their early phases of research and development may fail to be commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. There is no assurance that any of our future research and development projects will be successful or completed within the anticipated time frame or budget or that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities, customers, or prospective customers, for the production of these newly developed products, or that these newly developed products will achieve commercial success. Even if such products can be successfully commercialized, they may not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect.\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain might adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and could damage our reputation.\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to minimize costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers might be unable to meet our demand requirements, which could preclude us from fulfilling our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays.\nIf our products do not perform as promised, we could experience increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation.\nThe failure of our products to perform as promised could result in increased costs, lower margins and harm to our reputation. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our existing or new products, which could result in significant product liability or warranty claims. In addition, any defects found in our products could result in a loss of revenues or market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to our reputation, indemnification claims, litigation, increased insurance costs and increased service costs, any of which could discourage customers from purchasing our products and materially harm our business.\nShortages or delays of supplies for component parts could adversely affect our operating results until alternate sources can be developed.\nOur operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components, devices and subassemblies in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules. If we experience any constrained supply of component parts, such constraints, if persistent, could adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed. There could be an increased risk of supplier constraints in periods where we are increasing production volume to meet customer demands. Volatility in the prices of these component parts, an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or, conversely, a temporary oversupply of these parts, could adversely affect our future operating results.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers\u2019 or licensees\u2019 confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we might be required to devote significant additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology, or IT, systems are an integral part of our business. We depend on our IT systems for scheduling, sales order entry, purchasing, materials management, accounting, and production functions. Our IT systems also allow us to ship products to our customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide a high level of customer service. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all eventualities. A serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive; our development of new and upgraded products could be adversely impacted by our inability to hire or retain personnel with appropriate technical abilities.\nWe believe that the continued service of our executive officers will be important to our future growth and competitiveness. However, other than the employment agreement we entered into with Mr. Whelan, Chief Executive Officer, we currently do not have any other employment agreements with our executive officers. We cannot provide assurance that any named executive officer will remain employed by us. The Muzinich term loan facility includes a key executive retention provision. Specifically, the cessation of service of any two of Tim Whelan, Michael Kandell or Daniel Monopoli as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Chief Technology Officer, respectively, as long as the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0 would constitute an event of default if those persons were not replaced with persons acceptable to Muzinich within 60 days.\nAdditionally, the design and manufacture of our products require substantial technical capabilities in many disparate disciplines, from engineering, mechanics and computer science to electronics and mathematics. We believe that the continued employment of key members of our technical and sales staffs will be important to us but, as with our executive officers, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed by us.\nFurthermore, our ability to research and develop new technologies and products, or upgraded versions of existing products, will depend, in part, on our ability to hire personnel with knowledge and skills that our current personnel do not have. If we are unable to hire or retain such qualified personnel, our revenues could be negatively impacted, and our business could suffer.\nWe rely on manufacturers\u2019 representatives to sell our products to key large accounts and the loss of a key manufacturer\u2019s representative could have a material impact on our revenues\nOur products are sold through a small in-house direct sales force as well as a network of industry specific manufacturers\u2019 representatives that have established relationships with our largest customers. Our arrangements with our manufacturers\u2019 representatives generally can be canceled by either party with advance written notice. The loss of a manufacturer\u2019s representative could result in a material decline in revenues.\nFinancial Risks\nOur degree of leverage could prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness, adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and expose us to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt.\nWe currently have a credit facility with Bank of America providing an asset-based revolver and a term loan facility with Muzinich BDC in the amount of $8.3 million.\nOur degree of leverage could have consequences, including:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to make payment on our indebtedness;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, research and development and future business opportunities;\n\u25cf exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due; and\n\u25cf limiting our ability to adjust quickly or at all to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nOur ability to continue to fund our obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund our debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe ongoing uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on and could have significant adverse consequences for our credit facility and term loan facility.\nThe agreements governing our Muzinich term loan and Bank of America credit facility limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional secured indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends, enter into transactions with our affiliates, and sell assets. In addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that might be in our long term best interest, such as, subject to permitted exceptions, making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, making investments and acquisitions, and extending loans and other advances to affiliates, unless approved in writing by Muzinich and Bank of America. Furthermore, the term loan facility contains specific financial covenants including a quarterly leverage test, fixed charge coverage test and a liquidity requirement for our CommAgility business. The credit facility with Bank of America contains one financial covenant which is a fixed charge coverage test. A default of a covenant in our Muzinich term loan facility would trigger a cross default in our Bank of America credit facility and vice versa.\nAs described above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to significant uncertainties with respect to the U.S. and global economies as well as the markets we serve. The impact of those uncertainties resulted in a significant downturn in certain aspects of our business, which caused us to fall out of compliance with the quarterly leverage test and fixed charge test for our term loan facility with Muzinich. On February 25, 2021, the Company, its subsidiaries and Muzinich agreed to amend their credit agreement (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d) to, among other things, obtain a waiver from Muzinich for the Company\u2019s obligation to comply with the consolidated leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants in the Muzinich term loan facility for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020. We were not in compliance with such covenants primarily as a result of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on our consolidated financial results. The Second Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of consolidated EBITDA, increased the interest margin rate and provided Muzinich consent to the changes in deferred purchase price payments to the Holzworth sellers, as described in \u201cHolzworth Deferred Purchase Price and Earn-out\u201d below. In addition, on February 25, 2021, the Company, its subsidiaries and Bank of America agreed to amend their credit facility to accommodate the changes to the deferred purchase price payments to the Holzworth sellers and provide Bank of America\u2019s consent to the Company entering into the aforementioned Muzinich amendment.\nOur failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default and cross default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nRisks related to our receipt of Paycheck Protection Program funding.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on our current and future operations we applied for funds under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d). In May 2020 we were approved for the amount of $2.0 million. The PPP loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith, the certification does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In early 2020, the Small Business Administration provided guidance that it would be unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such company should be prepared to demonstrate to the Small Business Administration, upon request, the basis for its certification. Further, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Small Business Administration Administrator announced that the government will conduct a full audit of all PPP loans of more than $2 million for which the borrower applies for forgiveness. While we believe we have satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, there is a risk that we may be deemed ineligible to have received the PPP loan or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP loan. In such event, we may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety, plus interest, and we could be subject to additional penalties.\nOur results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters.\nA number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in accounting principles. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile and the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger companies in the wireless and advanced communications industries.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility and may continue to be subject to rapid swings in the future. From January 1, 2015 to February 3, 2021, the trading prices of our stock have ranged from $0.71 to $3.21 per share. There are several factors which could affect the price of our common stock unrelated to our financial performance, including announcements of technological innovations for new commercial products by us or our competitors, developments concerning propriety rights, new or revised governmental regulation or general conditions in the market or for our products, and the entrance of additional competitors into our markets.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE American, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger companies in the wireless and advanced communications industries. Traditionally, the trading volume of our common stock has been limited. For example, for the 90 trading days ending on February 3, 2021, the average daily trading volume was approximately 85,000 shares per day and ranged from between 1,200 shares per day and approximately 1.6 million shares per day. Furthermore, we only have 21,660,318 shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this report. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. Because of our limited trading volume, holders of our common stock may not be able to sell quickly any significant number of shares, and any attempted sales of a large number of our shares will likely have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of the NYSE American require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, stockholder approvals and voting, and soliciting proxies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensuring compliance with all of these requirements.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nOur credit facility with Bank of America and term loan facility with Muzinich BDC are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors. Our credit facility with Bank of America and term loan facility with Muzinich BDC are indexed to the one month and three-month LIBOR, respectively. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. treasury repo market, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the SOFR in May 2018. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the SOFR or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets, and could have an adverse effect on LIBOR-based interest rates on our current or future debt obligations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock might be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price could decline.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe testing and use of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability claims being asserted by customers and third parties.\nClaims may be asserted against us by end-users of any of our products for liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device made by us, and we could be subject to corresponding litigation should one or more of our products fail to perform or meet certain minimum requirements. Such a claim and corresponding litigation could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources and management attention, termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address and comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers and subjecting us to civil and criminal penalties.\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to U.S. government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the U.S. government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or civil and criminal penalties.\nWe could be subject to significant costs related to environmental contamination from past operations, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and waste, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.\nCertain of our products and our business are subject to ITAR, Export Administration Regulations, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and foreign government laws, regulations, policies and practices, and our failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international revenues, for which we also use foreign representatives and consultants, are subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the ITAR and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other export laws and regulations, as well as foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices which may differ from the U.S. government regulations in this regard.\nCompliance with the directives of the U.S. Department of State may result in substantial legal and other expenses and the diversion of management time. In the event that a determination is made that we or any entity we have acquired has violated the ITAR with respect to any matters, we may be subject to substantial monetary penalties that we are unable to quantify at this time, and/or suspension or revocation of our export privileges and criminal sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe can give no assurance that under either the ITAR or the EAR we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses and authorizations or that certain revenues will not be prevented or delayed due to compliance issues related to the ITAR or the EAR.\nWe are also subject to, and must comply with, the FCPA and similar world-wide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. These acts generally prohibit both us and our third party intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of acquiring or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. We are required as well to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to fully and accurately reflect our transactions. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption. In certain circumstances, the FCPA and our programs and policies may conflict with local customs and practices. If we or any of our local intermediaries have failed to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, governmental authorities in the United States could seek to impose severe criminal and civil penalties. The assertion of violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various other governmental regulations, compliance with which could cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we could be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various other significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content and labor regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations.\nThird parties could claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs, diversion of significant managerial resources and significant harm to our reputation.\nThe industries in which our company operates are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to our business. Defending claims, including claims without merit, requires allocation of resources, including personnel and capital, which could adversely impact our results of operations. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, which could adversely affect our net revenues, gross margins and expenses and harm our future prospects.\nWe use specialized technologies and know-how to design, develop and manufacture our products. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could hurt our competitive position, harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that our intellectual property, including its methodologies, is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use by third parties, our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected.\nAttempts may be made to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology. Our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined if:\n\u25cf the proprietary nature or protection of our methodologies is not recognized in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u25cf third parties misappropriate our proprietary methodologies and such misappropriation is not detected; and\n\u25cf competitors create applications similar to ours but which do not technically infringe on our legally protected rights.\nIf these risks materialize, we could be required to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and to divert critical managerial resources. In addition, our proprietary methodologies could decline in value or our rights to them could become unenforceable. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nEnvironmental and other disasters, such as flooding, large earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, or a combination thereof, may negatively impact our business.\nAlthough we manufacture our products in New Jersey and Colorado, we both source and ship our products globally. Environmental and other disasters could cause disruption to our supply chain or impede our ability to ship product to certain regions of the world. There can be no assurance that environmental and/or other such natural disasters will not have an adverse impact on our business in the future.\nNew Jersey corporate law may delay or prevent a transaction that stockholders would view as favorable.\nWe are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which could delay or prevent a change of control of us. In general, the Act prevents a shareholder owning 10% or more of a New Jersey public corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock from engaging in business combinations with that corporation for five years following the date the shareholder acquired 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, unless board approval is obtained prior to the time that the shareholder reaches the 10% threshold.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and common stock price.\nAs a public company with SEC reporting obligations, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which require annual assessments by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nDuring the course of our assessment, we may identify deficiencies that we are unable to remediate in a timely manner. Testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting may also divert management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or its effect on our operations. Moreover, any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may impede our ability to file timely and accurate reports with the SEC. Any of the above could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or our common stock listing on the NYSE American exchange to be suspended or terminated, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe Company is subject to compliance with the policies and procedures of the NYSE American Exchange with respect to continued listing on the stock exchange and our failure to maintain our listing would make trades in our securities difficult for shareholders.\nIn considering whether a security warrants continued trading and/or listing on the NYSE American Exchange, many factors are taken into account, such as the degree of investor interest in the company, its prospects for growth, the reputation of its management, the degree of commercial acceptance of its products, and whether its securities have suitable characteristics for auction market trading. Thus, any developments which substantially reduce the size of a company, the nature and scope of its operations, the value or amount of its securities available for the market, or the number of holders of its securities, might occasion a review of continued listing by the Exchange. Moreover, events such as the sale, destruction, loss or abandonment of a substantial portion of a company\u2019s business, the inability to continue its business, steps towards liquidation, or repurchase or redemption of its securities, may also give rise to such a review. The loss of our listing on the Exchange could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our shares or for others to purchase our shares. This could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nInternational Risks\nOur operating results may suffer because of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nSubstantially all of our sales contracts with our U.S. and international based customers provide for payment in U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies could increase the effective cost of our products to our international customers as their functional currency is typically not the U.S. dollar. This could have a potential adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain average selling prices of our products to our foreign-based customers.\nOur future revenue and expenses may be subject to volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe success of our ability to grow revenues and develop relationships in Europe and Asia may be limited by risks related to conducting business in European and Asian markets.\nPart of our strategy is to increase revenues and build our relationships in European and Asian markets. Risks inherent in marketing, selling and developing relationships in European and Asian markets include those associated with:\n\u25cf economic conditions in European and Asian markets, including the impact of recessions in European and Asian economies and fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and Asian currencies;\n\u25cf taxes and fees imposed by European and Asian governments that may increase the cost of products and services;\n\u25cf greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u25cf seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world;\n\u25cf laws and regulations imposed by individual countries and by the European Union, particularly with respect to intellectual property, license requirements and environmental requirements; and\n\u25cf political and economic instability, terrorism and war.\nIn addition, European and Asian intellectual property laws are different than and might not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. intellectual property laws, and we will have to ensure that our intellectual property is adequately protected in foreign jurisdictions and in the United States. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors could use our proprietary technologies in non-protected jurisdictions and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) elected to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.) in a national referendum (also referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). CommAgility is located in the U.K. Although the U.K. and E.U. have recently entered into a trade and cooperation agreement, the long-term nature of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U. remains unclear and there is considerable uncertainty as to their future political and economic relations. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and we do not know to what extent Brexit will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the U.K., the rest of the E.U. or other countries.\nThe volatility in financial markets due to Brexit could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. Additionally, disruptions and uncertainty caused by Brexit may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services. Brexit may also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts, including, without limitation, the statements under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
