{"cik": "844985", "company": "POSITRON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Associated with Business Activities\nHistory of Losses. To date, the Company has been unable to sell its products in quantities sufficient to be operationally profitable. Consequently, the Company has sustained substantial losses. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had a net loss of approximately $3,678,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $7,104,000 during 2013. At December 31, 2014, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $127,110,000. There can be no assurances that the Company will ever achieve the level of revenues needed to be operationally profitable in the future and if profitability is achieved, that it will be sustained. Due to the limited number of products that have been sold in each fiscal period, the Company\u2019s revenues have fluctuated, and may likely continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. The opinion of the Company\u2019s independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2013 expressed doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will need to obtain additional capital and increase product sales to become profitable.\nRecruiting and Retention of Qualified Personnel. The Company\u2019s success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of its executive officers and key employees. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of its key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company\u2019s success is also dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of its business, particularly management, research and development, sales and marketing and engineering. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. If the Company is unable to retain and attract such qualified personnel, its business, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWorking Capital. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $208,000 at December 31, 2014. The Company utilized $433,000 proceeds from issuance of convertible debt and $1,000,000 proceeds from the sale of common stock for equity to fund operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $849,000 and a negative working capital of approximately $1,967,000. The Company believes that it may continue to experience operating losses and accumulate deficits in the foreseeable future. If we are unable to obtain financing to meet our cash needs we may have to severely limit or cease our business activities or may seek protection from our creditors under the bankruptcy laws.\nPenny Stock Rules. If the shares of the Registrant's common stock are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or certain other national securities exchanges and the price thereof is below $5.00, then subsequent purchases of such securities will be subject to the requirements of the penny stock rules absent the availability of another exemption. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in \"penny stocks.\" Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document required by the SEC, to provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account, to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules.\nA Small Number of Large Stockholders and Thinly Traded Market. A small number of our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they may sell in the public market. In addition, our common stock is thinly traded and any significant sales of our common stock may cause volatility in our common stock price. Sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sale may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. We have also registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans. Accordingly, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. If any of these stockholders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise capital in the future.\nIn addition, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. As a result of their actions, or inaction our stock price may decline.\nSubstantial Competition and Effects of Technological Change. The industry in which the Company is engaged is subject to rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that Company\u2019s systems can be upgraded to meet future innovations in the industry or that new technologies will not emerge, or existing technologies will not be improved, which would render the Company\u2019s products obsolete or non-competitive. Many of our competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including: greater name recognition; greater financial, technical and service resources; established relationships with healthcare professionals; established distribution networks; additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives; and greater resources for product development and sales and marketing. In addition, there can be no assurance that other established medical imaging companies, any of which would likely have greater resources than the Company, will not enter the market. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against any of its competitors.\nThe downturn in the U.S. economy. Our revenues may be significantly impacted by the downturn in the U.S. economy. The slowing economy may also drive greater pricing pressures from our competition, increase the rate at which we lose business, or lead to disruptions in our supply chain, any of which would impede our ability to become profitable. Further, we cannot assure you that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate, if at all positive, improvement in our operating results or cash flows.\nDependence upon third-party suppliers and the availability of certain radiopharmaceuticals. We rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply certain key components of our products. Alternative sources of production and supply may not be readily available. We have also outsourced production of PET systems to a single contract manufacturer. If a disruption in the availability of parts, or in the operations of these suppliers were to occur, our business could be materially affected. For this reason, we have backup plans in place that are designed to prevent delays in production. If these plans are unsuccessful, delays in the production of systems for an extended period of time could cause the loss of revenue, which could significantly harm our business and results of operations. Our equipment involves the use of certain radiopharmaceuticals. If there are disruptions in the supply of these radiopharmaceuticals, that will cause us to cancel services that would otherwise be provided. If there is an inadequate supply of the necessary radiopharmaceuticals, we may be unable to sell our equipment, and our business may be harmed.\nNo Assurance of Market Acceptance. The Company\u2019s systems involve new technology that competes with more established technologies. The purchase and installation of our system involves a significant capital expenditure on the part of the purchaser. A potential purchaser of our system must have an available patient base that is large enough to provide the utilization rate needed to justify such capital expenditure. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s systems will be accepted by the target markets, or that the Company\u2019s sales of systems will increase or that the Company will be profitable.\nPatents and Proprietary Technology. The Company holds certain patent and trade secret rights relating to various aspects of its technologies, which are of material importance to the Company and its future prospects. Any patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may attempt to challenge or invalidate our patents, or may be able to design alternative techniques or devices that avoid infringement of our patents, or develop products with functionalities that are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge, even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s products will not infringe on any patents of others. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others.\nIn addition, the Company requires each of its consultants to enter into a confidentiality agreement designed to assist in protecting the Company\u2019s proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for the Company\u2019s trade secrets or proprietary know-how in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the Company\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary know-how.\nWe Use Products that are Highly Regulated. In July 2011, Bracco Diagnostics Inc. voluntarily recalled its CardioGen-82 generator after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) found that certain patients who had undergone PET imaging scans with rubidium chloride injected from CardioGen-82 generator, the radioactive drug injected into a patient to evaluate the functions of the heart, received excessive yet non-harmful amounts of the radiopharmaceutical. The recall was lifted in or about January 2012 and adversely affected the Company\u2019s operations. There can be no assurance that another, similar incident or a voluntary recall will not occur which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment Regulation. We are directly, or indirectly through our clients, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business including: the federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws, other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions, and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by us and our DIS customers; the federal False Claims statutes; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA; the Stark Law; the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; federal and state radioactive materials laws; state food and drug and pharmacy laws and regulations; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and non-physicians; state scope-of-practice laws; and federal rules prohibiting the mark-up of diagnostic tests to Medicare under certain circumstances. If our customers are unable or unwilling to comply with these statutes, regulations, rules and policies, utilization rates of our services and products will decline and our business will be harmed.\nWe maintain a compliance program to identify and correct any compliance issues and remain in compliance with all applicable laws, to train employees, to audit and monitor our operations, and to achieve other compliance goals. Like most companies with compliance programs, we occasionally discover compliance concerns. In such cases, we take responsive action including corrective measures when necessary. There can be no assurance that our responsive actions will insulate us from liability associated with any detected compliance concerns.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules or policies described above or the other laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal or state health care programs, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could have a negative impact on us. If we are excluded from federal or state health care programs, our customers who participate in those programs could not do business with us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation.\nAll laws and regulations, including those specifically applicable to the Company, are subject to change. The Company cannot predict what effect changes in laws and regulations might have on its business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, sales of medical devices outside the country may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements. These requirements vary widely from country to country. There is no assurance that the time and effort required to meet those varying requirements may not adversely affect Positron\u2019s ability to distribute its systems in some countries.\nNo Dividends. The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 80017, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "POSC"}
