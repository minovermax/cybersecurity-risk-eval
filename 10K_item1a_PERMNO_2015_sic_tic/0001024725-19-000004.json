Economic difficulties generally lead to tightening of credit and liquidity. These conditions often lead to low consumer confidence, which in turn results in delayed and reduced purchases of durable goods such as automobiles and other vehicles. As a result, during difficult economic times our OE customers can significantly reduce their production schedules. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 in North America and Europe. More recently, light vehicle and commercial vehicle production has declined significantly in South America in 2015 and 2016 and persistent challenges in the Chinese economy in 2018 and continuing into 2019 may result in lower-than-anticipated growth in both light and commercial vehicles in the region. Additionally, production of off-highway equipment with our content on them have been weak in certain product applications, such as agricultural and construction equipment in North America and Europe. Any deterioration or prolonged difficulty in economic conditions in any region in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and liquidity.\nIn addition, economic difficulties often lead to disruptions in the financial markets, which may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit which could materially and negatively affect our company. Future disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers\u2019 and our ability to access the liquidity that is necessary to fund operations on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nIn addition, financial or other difficulties at any of our major customers could have a material adverse impact on us, including as a result of lost revenues, significant write downs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructuring beyond our current global plans. Severe financial or other difficulties at any of our major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain on a timely basis on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components we require to produce our products.\nMoreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any light vehicle or commercial vehicle manufacturer or other supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force original equipment manufacturers and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to shut down production at plants. While the issues that our customers and suppliers face during economic difficulties may be primarily financial in nature, other difficulties, such as an inability to meet increased demand as conditions recover, could also result in supply chain and other disruptions.\nFactors that reduce demand for our products or reduce prices could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic conditions and other factors present in the various domestic and international markets where our products are sold. Demand for our OE products is subject to the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are equipped with our parts. The level of new light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway vehicle purchases is cyclical, affected by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates and availability of credit, consumer confidence, patterns of consumer spending, industrial construction levels, fuel costs, government incentives and vehicle replacement cycles. Consumer preferences and government regulations also impact the demand for new light vehicle purchases equipped with our products. For example, if consumers increasingly prefer electric vehicles, demand for the vehicles equipped with our clean air products would decrease.\nDemand for our aftermarket, or replacement, products varies based upon such factors as general economic conditions; the level of new vehicle purchases, which initially displaces demand for aftermarket products; the severity of winter weather, which increases the demand for certain aftermarket products; the number of vehicles in operation; and other factors, including the average useful life of parts and number of miles driven.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive and commercial vehicle industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Decreases in demand for automobiles and commercial vehicles and vehicle parts generally, or in the demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we believe that increasingly stringent environmental standards for emissions have presented and will continue to present an important opportunity for us to grow our clean air product line. We cannot assure you, however, that environmental standards for emissions will continue to become more stringent or that the adoption of any new standards will not be delayed beyond our expectations.\nWe are dependent on certain large customers for future revenue. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe depend on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of our revenues. For example, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, General Motors and Ford accounted for 12% and 12% of our net sales, respectively. Following the Federal-Mogul acquisition, we are increasingly dependent on certain major aftermarket customers for our revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. We may experience decreased revenues from these customers for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: (i) in the case of our OE customers, loss of awarded platforms, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products, and work stoppages or other disruptions impacting OE production, and (ii) in the case of our aftermarket customers, reduced or delayed consumer requirements and competition from other brands or lower-cost alternatives. Further, our aftermarket customers are generally able to change suppliers more quickly than OE customers, which exacerbates these risks with respect to our aftermarket business. For all of our customers, we face the risk of their failure to pay us for a variety of reasons, including their respective financial conditions.\nIn addition, our customers compete intensively against each other. The loss of market share by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business unless we are able to achieve increased sales to other major customers.\nWe are subject to, and could be further subject to, government investigations or actions by other third parties.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the United States and internationally, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions. Responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nFor example, antitrust authorities in various jurisdictions are investigating possible violations of antitrust laws by multiple automotive parts suppliers, including Tenneco. In addition, Tenneco and certain of its competitors are currently subject to civil putative class action lawsuits in the United States, which allege anti-competitive conduct related to the activities subject to these investigations. More related lawsuits may be filed, including in other jurisdictions.\nWhile we have established a reserve that we believe is adequate to resolve Tenneco\u2019s antitrust matters globally, we cannot, however, assure you that the reserve will not change materially from time to time or that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may be unable to realize sales represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe realization of future sales from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our OE customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that our OE customers and consumers may choose. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 in North America and Europe. More recently, light vehicle and commercial truck production has declined significantly in South America in 2015 and 2016 and persistent challenges in the Chinese economy in 2018 and going into 2019 may result in lower-than-anticipated growth in both light and commercial vehicles in the region. In addition to the risks inherent in the cyclicality of vehicle production, our customers generally have the right to replace us with another supplier at any time for a variety of reasons and have demanded price decreases over the life of awarded business. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will in fact realize any or all of the future sales represented by our awarded business. Any failure to realize these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded OE business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. In certain instances, the terms of our OE customer arrangements permit us to recover these pre-production costs if the customer cancels the business through no fault of our company. Although we have been successful in recovering these costs under appropriate circumstances in the past, we can give no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially impacted in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs in the event of an OE customer\u2019s cancellation of awarded business.\nOur level of debt, which increased in amount and percentage of floating rate debt as a result of the Acquisition, makes us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; and provisions in our debt agreements could constrain our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur leverage increased as a result of the Acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our new senior credit facility, $2.0 billion of outstanding notes and approximately $100 million of other debt. In addition, as a result of the Acquisition we have increased exposure to interest rate fluctuations because our percentage of floating rate debt increased.\nOur level of debt makes us more vulnerable to changes in our results of operations because a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing our debt and is not available for other purposes and our level of debt could impair our ability to raise additional capital if necessary. Further increases in interest rates will increase the amount of cash required for debt service. Under the terms of our existing senior secured credit facility, the indentures governing our notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, we are able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The more we become leveraged, the more we, and in turn our security holders, become exposed to many of the risks described herein.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, capital investment and working capital requirements, we may need to reduce or cease our repurchase of shares or payments of dividends, seek additional financing or sell assets. If we require such financing and are unable to obtain it, we could be forced to sell assets under unfavorable circumstances and we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations.\nIn addition, our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other debt;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur senior credit facility and other agreements governing financings we enter into from time to time require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our senior credit facility and our other financing instruments require us to comply with various operational and other covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our financing instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted financing could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that financing to be due and payable immediately (which, in turn, could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing arrangements). If such event occurs, the lenders under our senior credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets and we could lose access to our factoring and supply chain financing programs. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding financing instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those financing instruments. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations, and on our ability to effect our share repurchase and dividend programs. For example, as a result of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, we needed to amend our senior credit agreement to revise the financial ratios we were required to maintain. Even though we were able to obtain that amendment, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain an amendment on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if required in the future.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing\narrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to improve operating performance and generate cost savings and improvements.\nWe regularly implement strategic and other initiatives designed to improve our operating performance. Our inability to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans or our failure to achieve the goals of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on these initiatives to offset pricing pressures from our suppliers and our customers, as described above, as well as to manage the impacts of production cuts. Our implementation of announced initiatives is from time to time subject to legal challenge in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions (where applicable employment laws differ from those in the United States). Furthermore, the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our notes may restrict the types of initiatives we undertake. In the past we have been successful in obtaining the consent of our senior lenders where appropriate in connection with our initiatives. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to pursue, successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any initiative or that we will be able to sustain improvements made to date.\nExchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to increased risk because we generate a significant portion of our net sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, where we have a greater portion of costs than revenues generated in a foreign currency, we are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate revenue because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating profit while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit.\nWe do not generally seek to mitigate the impact of currency through the use of derivative financial instruments. To the extent we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in that currency could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe hourly workforce in the industry in which we participate is highly unionized and our business could be adversely affected by labor disruptions.\nA portion of our hourly workforce in North America and the majority of our hourly workforce in other regions are unionized. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, our business could be adversely affected by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. We have not experienced a material labor disruption in our recent history, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise.\nIn addition, substantially all of the hourly employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in North America and many of their other suppliers are represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America under collective bargaining agreements. Vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees in other countries are also subject to labor agreements. A work stoppage or strike at one of our production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of ours or any of our customers, could have an adverse impact on us by disrupting demand for our products and/or our ability to manufacture our products.\nFrom time to time we experience significant increases and fluctuations in raw materials pricing and increases in certain lead times; and future changes in the prices of raw materials or utility services, or future increases in lead times, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nSignificant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in our products, mainly steel, oil and rubber, or the cost of utility services required to produce our products, to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price we charge our customers or are otherwise mitigated, could materially and adversely impact our results. For example, in March 2018, the current U.S. administration imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and throughout 2018, and announced additional tariffs on goods imported from China specifically, as well as certain other countries. In addition, during 2017, carbon steel prices as well as raw material prices (such as ferrochrome, iron ore, scrap and coking coal) to produce carbon steel remained at high levels after the sharp increases in 2016. In addition, both the European Union as well as the\nUnited States continue to impose a variety of anti-dumping duties on carbon steel as well as stainless steel. This not only results in higher domestic pricing but limits opportunities in terms of off shore buying. Carbon steel prices in North America increased further in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the run-up to the mandated \"232 Section Investigations\" against the import deadline of mid January 2018.\nWe attempt to mitigate price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best cost countries, and strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities. We also aggressively negotiate to recover these higher costs from our customers, and in some cases, such as with respect to steel surcharges, we have the contractual right to recover some or all of these higher costs from certain of our customers. However, if we are successful in recovering these higher costs, we may not receive that recovery in the same period that the costs were incurred and the benefit of the recovery may not be evenly distributed throughout the year.\nWe also continue to pursue productivity initiatives and other opportunities to reduce costs through restructuring activities. During periods of economic recovery, the cost of raw materials and utility services generally rise. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we will not face further increased prices in the future or, if we do, whether our actions will be effective in containing them.\nBy entering into new product lines and employing new technologies, our ability to produce certain of these products may be constrained due to longer lead times for our facilities, as well as those of our suppliers. We attempt to mitigate the negative effects of these longer lead times by improving the accuracy of our long term planning; however, we cannot provide any certainty that we will always be successful in avoiding disruptions to our delivery schedules.\nWe may incur costs related to product warranties, environmental and regulatory matters, legal proceedings and other claims, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We cannot assure you that costs associated with providing product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements. For a description of our accounting policies regarding warranty reserves, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d included in Item 7.\nOur global operations subject us to extensive governmental regulations worldwide. Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations may change from time to time and our compliance with new or amended laws and regulations in the future may materially increase our costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position. For example, we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Soil and groundwater remediation activities are being conducted at certain of our current and former real properties. We record liabilities for these activities when environmental assessments indicate that the remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. On this basis, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for the remediation activities at our current and former real properties for which we could be held responsible. Although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. In future periods, we could incur cash costs or charges to earnings if we are required to undertake remediation efforts as the result of ongoing analysis of the environmental status of our properties. In addition, violations of the laws and regulations we are subject to could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, as well as prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe also from time to time are involved in a variety of legal proceedings, claims or investigations. These matters typically are incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against us relating to environmental liabilities, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, taxes, employment matters or commercial or contractual disputes or allegations relating to legal compliance by us or our employees. For example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos. Many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants. Many of these cases also involve numerous defendants, with the number of defendants in some cases exceeding 100 defendants from a variety of industries. As major asbestos manufacturers or other companies that used asbestos in their manufacturing processes continue to go out of business, we may experience an increased number of these claims.\nWe vigorously defend ourselves in connection with all of the matters described above. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d included in Item 7.\nDevelopments relating to our intellectual property could materially impact our business.\nWe and others in our industry hold a number of patents and other intellectual property rights, including licenses, which are critical to our respective businesses and competitive positions. Notwithstanding our intellectual property portfolio, our competitors may develop similar or superior proprietary technologies. Further, as we expand into regions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others replicating our proprietary technologies increases, which could result in a deterioration of our competitive position. On occasion, we may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our competitive position.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions or security breaches, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store, and support business activities. Some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. We have put in place a number of systems, processes, and practices designed to protect against the failure of our systems, as well as the misappropriation, exposure or corruption of the information stored thereon. Unintentional service disruptions or intentional actions such as intellectual property theft, cyber-attacks, unauthorized access or malicious software, may lead to such misappropriation, exposure or corruption if our, or our service providers\u2019, protective measures prove to be inadequate. Further, these events may cause operational impediments or otherwise adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and/or results of operations. We could also encounter violations of applicable law or reputational damage from the disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers or suppliers. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information could lead to the loss of our intellectual property and/or diminished competitive advantages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. In addition, evolving and expanding compliance and operational requirements under the privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nWe may have difficulty competing favorably in the highly competitive light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier industry.\nThe light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets which we serve. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, global presence and timely delivery. As a result, many suppliers have established or are establishing themselves in emerging, low-cost markets to reduce their costs of production and be more conveniently located for customers. Although we are also pursuing a best-cost country production strategy and otherwise continue to seek process improvements to reduce costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in this competitive market or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales or profit margins.\nIn addition, our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours, adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do, particularly in respect of potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products. These trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize on new technologies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, due to the cost focus of our major OE customers, we have been, and expect to continue to be, requested to reduce prices as part of our initial business quotations and over the life of OE vehicle platforms we have been awarded. We cannot be certain that we will be able to generate cost savings and operational improvements in the future that are sufficient to offset price reductions requested by existing OE customers and necessary to win additional business. OE customers also direct us into suppliers for component purchases not allowing us to leverage our own supply base and realize cost reductions on this directed spend.\nThe decreasing number of customers and suppliers in our industry could make it more difficult for us to compete favorably.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected because the customer base for our parts and services is decreasing in both the OE market and aftermarket. As a result, we are competing for business from fewer customers. Furthermore, consolidation among suppliers have resulted in fewer, larger suppliers who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. If we cannot achieve cost savings and operational improvements sufficient to allow us to compete favorably in the future with these larger companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to a reduction of, or inability to increase, sales.\nOur aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted by increasing competition from lower cost, private-label products.\nDistribution channels in the aftermarket have continued to consolidate and, as a result, our sales to large retail customers represent a significant portion of our aftermarket business. Private-label aftermarket products, which are typically manufactured at a lower cost, often containing little or no premium technology, and are branded with a store or other private-label brand, are increasingly available to these large retail customers. Our aftermarket business is facing increasing competition from these lower cost, private-label products and there is growing pressure to expand our entry-level product lines so that retailers may offer a greater range of price points to their consumer customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our aftermarket sales to these large retail customers or that increased competition from these lower cost, private-label aftermarket products will not have an adverse impact on our aftermarket business.\nIf the reputation of one or more of our leading brands is harmed, aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur aftermarket sales are dependent on the reputation and success of our brands, including Monroe\u00ae, Champion\u00ae, \u00d6hlins\u00ae, MOOG\u00ae, Walker\u00ae, Fel-Pro\u00ae, Wagner\u00ae, Ferodo\u00ae, Rancho\u00ae, Thrush\u00ae, National\u00ae, Sealed Power\u00ae and others. Product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity that could harm the reputation of our brands. If one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nImprovements in automotive parts are adversely affecting aftermarket demand for some of our products.\nThe average useful life of automotive parts has steadily increased in recent years due to innovations in products and technologies. The longer product lives allow vehicle owners to replace parts of their vehicles less often. As a result, a portion of sales in the aftermarket has been displaced. In addition, advancements in technology may lead to enhancements in aftermarket product performance that render our product obsolete. This has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our aftermarket sales. Also, any additional increases in the average useful lives of automotive parts or other enhancements in aftermarket performance would further adversely affect the demand for our aftermarket products.\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution towards autonomous vehicles and car and ride sharing could adversely affect our business.\nThe light vehicle industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully automated driving experience. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional light vehicle industry. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OE and consumer preferences could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nChanges in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues.\nWe cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development or production, and failure of products to operate properly. If we are unable to react to changes in the marketplace, including the potential introduction of technologies such as autonomous driving solutions, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition.\nWe may, from time to time, consider acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired businesses, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, any acquisitions could involve the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we pursue or that such acquisitions, and the potential related synergies, will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or deliver any anticipated strategic benefits. Any such failure could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. Our joint ventures are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our partners, and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint ventures. There is a risk that our partners' objectives for the joint ventures may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements over management of the joint ventures. At some of our joint ventures, our joint venture partner is also affiliated with the largest customer of the joint venture, which may create a conflict between the interests of our partner and the joint venture. Also, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nAdditional risks associated with joint ventures include our partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners, a change in the ownership of any of our partners and our limited ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating a multi-national company.\nWe have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many regions across six continents. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, a significant portion of our net sales were derived from operations outside North America. Current events including tax reform proposals and the possibility of renegotiated trade deals and international tax law treaties, create a level of uncertainty, and potentially increased complexity, for multi-national companies. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, international operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or our business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;\n\u2022\nexposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;\n\u2022\nexposure to local social conditions, including corruption and any acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ninflation in certain countries;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nretaliatory tariffs and restrictions limiting free movement of goods and an unfavorable trade environment, including as a result of political conditions and changes in the laws in the United States and elsewhere and as described in more details below;\n\u2022\nthe impact of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of Brexit; and\n\u2022\nrequirements for manufacturers to use locally produced goods.\nEntering new markets poses new competitive threats and commercial risks.\nAs we have expanded into markets beyond light vehicles, we expect to diversify our product sales by leveraging technologies being developed for the light vehicle segment. Such diversification requires investments and resources which may not be available as needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into new markets and thus, in meeting the needs of these new customers and competing favorably in these new markets. Further, a significant portion of our growth potential is dependent on our ability to increase sales to commercial truck and off-highway vehicle customers. While we believe that we can achieve our growth targets with the production contracts that have been or will be awarded to us, our future prospects will be negatively affected if those customers underlying these contracts experience reduced demand for their products, or financial difficulties.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, which may become impaired in the future and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long lived assets, goodwill, and other identifiable intangibles assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and brand names, and developed technologies due to the acquisition of Federal-Mogul. Long lived assets, goodwill, and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $4,078 million as of December 31, 2018, or 30% of our total assets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, are required to be evaluated for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause profitability and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events indicate it is warranted. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately and subjects us to financial statement risk in the event that long lived assets, goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $379 million in net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total profit or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in certain jurisdictions may provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of profits and losses between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate.\nChanges in tax law or trade agreements and new or changed tariffs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions and/or changes in laws and policies governing U.S. tax laws, foreign trade (including trade agreements and tariffs), manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we and/or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and business.\nFor example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced tax rates regardless of whether the earnings are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payments to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments as opposed to deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nIn addition, the United States, Mexico and Canada have renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The revised agreement, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), contains new and revised provisions that alter the prior rules governing when imports and exports of autos and auto parts are eligible for duty-free treatment. Generally these new rules require a higher percentage of the overall content of the auto or autopart to originate in one of the USMCA's countries (the U.S., Mexico or Canada). The U.S. Congress must approve the USMCA provisions before they can become effective. Our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are dependent on duty-free trade within the USMCA region. We have significant movement of goods within NAFTA region, and the imposition of customs duties on imports could negatively impact our financial performance.\nMoreover, in March 2018, the U.S. government imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on certain steel imports and a 10% ad valorem tariff on certain aluminum imports. There was a short exemption period from the steel and aluminum tariffs for Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which ended on June 1, 2018. As a result of the tariffs, countries such as, Canada, China and Mexico have implemented retaliatory actions with respect to U.S. imports into their countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, on three separate occasions in 2018, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on products from China. Specifically, on July 6, 2018, an additional 25% ad valorem tariff was imposed on certain imports from China. On August 23, 2018, an additional group of Chinese imports were assessed an additional 25% ad valorem tariff, and finally on September 24, 2018, a third group of Chinese imports were assessed an additional 10% ad valorem tariff (set to increase to 25% on March 2, 2019, if no resolution is reached with China by that date). The Administration has signaled that additional Chinese products may be targeted with additional tariffs. China has retaliated with tariffs on certain U.S. imports.\nThe imposition of the steel and aluminum tariffs, or any future imposition of tariffs or duties, is expected to have a pervasive impact on the metals market in which we operate and could result in a decrease in imports and higher prices for those imports which are sold into the U.S. When we buy metals internationally, we may be unable to pass through the higher costs to our customers, which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. In addition, a decrease in imports could cause a disruption or shortage in the availability of the raw materials that we buy, which could limit our ability to meet customer demand or purchase material at competitive prices. This could cause the Company to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect operating results.\nFurther, in May 2018, the U.S. government announced that it is considering potential additional tariffs to be imposed on imported automobiles and automotive parts. Certain aspects of our business depend on the importation of automotive parts from outside of the U.S. If these or other similar tariffs are imposed, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's pension obligations and other postretirement benefits assumed as a result of the Acquisition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating margins and cash flows.\nFollowing completion of the Acquisition, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have increased. The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be affected by the rising cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, the Company sponsors certain defined benefit plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in the pension plans does not meet the Company\u2019s expectations, or other actuarial assumptions are modified, the Company\u2019s required contributions may be higher than it expects.\nThe Company\u2019s hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs.\nIn order to mitigate short-term variation in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations, the Company hedged a portion of near-term exposure to certain raw materials used in production processes, primarily copper, nickel, tin, zinc, high-grade aluminum and aluminum alloy. The results of this hedging practice could be positive, neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures.\nOur hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term commodity price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect from long-term commodity price increases. Our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw materials costs, which would accelerate the recognition in our operating results of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions.\nIf we cannot attract, retain, and motivate employees, we may be unable to compete effectively, and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses.\nOur success and ability to grow depend, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business in many locations around the world. We face intense competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial and other personnel. Recruiting, training, retention, and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of key management employees or a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us.\nRisks Relating to the Acquisition and Planned Spin-off\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We and, following the planned Spin-off, each separate company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the business of Federal-Mogul.\nThe success of the transaction will depend, in part, on our ability (and the ability of each separate company following the planned Spin-off) (defined below) to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and planned Spin-off (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) and on our (and each separate company\u2019s) ability to integrate Federal-Mogul\u2019s business in an effective and efficient manner, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration process may disrupt business and, if we are unable to successfully integrate Federal-Mogul\u2019s business, we (and each separate company) could fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our (and each separate company\u2019s) business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of Federal-Mogul may result in material unanticipated challenges, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the Transaction;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential liabilities the Company may be inheriting from Federal-Mogul; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of anticipated revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, each of which could adversely affect our (and each separate company\u2019s) business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, even if the integration of Federal-Mogul\u2019s business is successful, we (and each separate company) may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Transaction, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of shares of our Common Stock (or each separate company\u2019s stock). As a result, it cannot be assured that the Transaction will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits and potential synergies.\nOur current stockholders may have reduced ownership and voting interests following the exercise of certain rights under the Purchase Agreement and exercise less influence over management.\nWe have granted certain registration rights to AEP for the resale of the shares issued in connection with the Acquisition. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such shares into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public trading. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf AEP transfers any shares of its Class B Common Stock to a third-party, the shares of Class B Common Stock so transferred will automatically convert in shares of Class A Common Stock and as a result, our current stockholders will experience a proportionate reduction in voting power.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of our Common Stock prior to the completion of the Acquisition.\nOur historical business differs from that of Federal-Mogul. Accordingly, our results of operations and the market price of our Common Stock following the completion of the Acquisition may be affected by factors that differ from those that previously affected the independent results of operations of each of Tenneco and Federal-Mogul and the market price of our existing common stock prior to the completion of the Acquisition.\nThe planned Spin-Off following the transaction is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to separate the combined company\u2019s businesses to create two new independent, publicly traded companies in a planned Spin-Off transaction. The planned Spin-Off is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that the planned Spin-Off will be completed at all or that the planned Spin-Off will be tax-free for U.S. federal income purposes. We expect that the process of completing the planned Spin-Off will be time consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the planned Spin-Off is not completed. We may encounter unforeseen impediments to the completion of the planned Spin-Off that render it impossible or impracticable.\nIf the planned Spin-Off is not completed, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our Common Stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the planned Spin-Off will be completed. If the completion of the planned Spin-Off is delayed, including by the receipt of an acquisition proposal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe tendency of the planned Spin-Off and impact of the Transaction could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nThe announcement and tendency of the planned Spin-Off could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business and affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees.\nAs a result of the Transaction, some customers, suppliers or strategic partners may terminate their business relationship with us. Potential customers, suppliers or strategic partners may delay entering into, or decide not to enter into, a business relationship with us because of the Transaction. If customer or supplier relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the Transaction, our (and each separate company\u2019s after the planned Spin-Off) business, financial condition and results of operations following the Acquisition or planned Spin-Off could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. Our success after and in implementing the Transaction depends in part upon the ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their roles with the combined company following the Acquisition or either separate company following the planned Spin-Off, or concerns regarding operations following the Transaction, any of which may have an adverse effect on the ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we (or each separate company after the planned Spin-Off) will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees following the Transaction to the extent that we have previously been able to attract or retain such employees.\nIn addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources to complete the Transaction, which could adversely impact our ability to manage existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe planned Spin-Off may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the planned Spin-Off. As new independent, publicly traded companies, the two companies will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus. As a result, the two companies may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the respective business, financial condition and results of operations of each company. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the planned Spin-Off not occurred.\nThe combined company prior to the planned Spin-Off and, if the planned Spin-Off is completed, each separate company following the Spin-Off may underperform relative to our expectations.\nFollowing completion of the Transaction, the combined company or each separate company may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and Federal-Mogul have achieved or might achieve separately. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or, following the planned Spin-Off, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each separate company.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Transaction that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs in connection with integrating the business and operations of Federal-Mogul with our business and operations and effectuating the planned Spin-Off. We may also incur additional unanticipated costs in the separation processes. These could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company following the planned Spin-Off, in the period in which such expenses are recorded, or the cash flows, in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nFurthermore, we and each company following the planned Spin-Off may incur material restructuring charges in connection with integration activities or the planned Spin-Off, which may adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses are recorded, or cash flows in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nWe may incur greater costs following the planned Spin-Off, which could decrease our profitability.\nOur businesses are operating in conjunction with one another, allowing us in certain circumstances to take advantage of the combined businesses\u2019 size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services. After the planned Spin-Off, we may be unable to obtain goods and services at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the planned Spin-Off. Our businesses also benefit from certain shared functions and services. Following the planned spin-off, we will retain some of these functions and services, and the entity to be spun off (\u201cDRiV Incorporated\u201d or \"DRiVTM\") will retain some of these functions and services. As to those functions and services DRiV retains, DRiV will provide certain of them to us on a short-term transitional basis after the planned Spin-Off, and we will be required to establish the necessary infrastructure and systems to provide these functions and services on an ongoing basis. As to those functions and services we retain, we will provide DRiV certain transition services on a short-term transitional basis after the planned Spin-Off. We may not be able to replace the services provided by DRiV in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from DRiV, and it may cost us more to provide services to DRiV than DRiV pays us for those services. If functions previously performed by DRiV, or services provided by us to DRiV, cost us more than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, our profitability could decrease.\nWe could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions to transition information technology infrastructure in connection with the planned Spin-Off.\nWe may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we and DRiV cannot transition effectively from the existing transactional and operational systems and data centers retained by the other, or from the transition services that support these functions. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Our failure to avoid operational interruptions as we implement any necessary new systems, our failure to implement any new systems and replace services successfully, or the insufficiency of our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities in the event of a disruption of our information technology services, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired.\nDRiV may not satisfy its obligations under various agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the planned Spin-Off.\nIn connection with the planned spin-off, we and DRiV will enter various agreements that govern the allocation of assets and liabilities between the two company and other matters. Included among these agreements will be a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Intellectual Property Matters Agreement and certain other agreements. Certain of these agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the planned Spin-Off. We will rely on DRiV to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If DRiV is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nThere could be significant liability if the planned Spin-Off is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nA condition to the planned spin-off is our receipt of an opinion from certain tax advisors with respect to certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the DRiV spin-off, each of which is in substance and form satisfactory to us. The opinion is expected to conclude that the planned spin-off of 100% of the outstanding DRiV shares to our stockholders and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of DRiV\u2019s common stock. Any such opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the DRiV that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and DRiV regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion or ruling.\nIf the planned Spin-Off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the Spin-Off could be treated as a taxable dividend to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of DRiV common stock\nexceeds our tax basis in such stock on the date of the planned Spin-Off. The Tax Matters Agreement we will enter into with DRiV will address which company is responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of the planned Spin-Off.", "PERMNO": 84375, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "TEN"}
