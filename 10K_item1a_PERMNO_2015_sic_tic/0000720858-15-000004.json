RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements or could result in a significant or material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAdverse changes in real estate activity may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for the Company\u2019s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services varies from year to year and is dependent upon, among other factors, the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions and mortgage financing transactions. The volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as the state of the overall economy, the average price level of real estate sales and the availability and pricing of mortgage financing. During periods of economic uncertainty, or when the availability of mortgage credit is limited or when mortgage interest rates are increasing, real estate activity typically declines. The cyclical nature of the Company\u2019s business has caused volatility in revenue and profitability in the past and could do so in the future.\nDemand for title insurance also depends in part upon the requirement by mortgage lenders and other participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property.\nThe Company may experience material losses resulting from fraud, defalcation or misconduct.\nFraud, defalcation and other misconduct by the Company\u2019s agents, approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the Company\u2019s business. Agents and approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trusts pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions. Misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in title claims, some of which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company receives a significant portion of its premiums from one agent. Significant declines in the agent\u2019s business or real estate activity in the agent\u2019s market would have a negative impact on premiums written.\nThe Company had one agent that accounted for 23.6%, 16.4% and 14.0% of net premiums written for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A significant decline in premiums received from this agent would have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. Such declines could result from declines in real estate activity in the agent\u2019s market, or from the agent using other title insurers. The agent is under no legal commitment to remit a minimum amount of premiums to the Company, and could cease doing so at any time.\nThe Company relies upon the Texas and North Carolina markets for a significant portion of its premiums. Changes in the economic or regulatory environments in Texas or North Carolina could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nTexas and North Carolina are the largest sources of premium revenue for the Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries. In 2014, Texas and North Carolina represented 36.5% and 28.4% of total premiums written by the Company, respectively. A decrease in the level of real estate activity in either Texas and/or North Carolina, whether driven by depressed economic conditions, changes in regulatory environments or other factors that influence demand, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAdverse deviation from expected claims experience will result in lower net earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s net income is affected by the extent to which its actual claims experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing reserves for claims. Reserves for claims are established based on actuarial estimates of future payments for reported claims, as well as claims which have been incurred but not yet reported. In addition, management considers factors such as the Company\u2019s historical claims experience, case reserve estimates on reported claims, large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the estimation of reserves for claims, the Company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims. Factors contributing to the complexity in establishing reserves can include varying loss potentials, timing, unfavorable market or economic conditions and the legal environment. The timing of claims is difficult to estimate as payments may not occur until well into the future. Higher levels of defaults and foreclosures upon insured properties are more prevalent in times of unfavorable economic conditions and can lead to an increase in title insurance claims. The Company may also incur higher than normal claim payment experience or large losses. To the extent that actual claims experience is greater than estimated, the Company could be required to increase reserves.\nDeterioration in financial markets may cause a decline in the performance of the Company\u2019s investments and could have a material adverse impact on net income.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its income from its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investment policy is designed to comply with regulatory requirements and to balance the competing objectives of asset quality and investment returns. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to risk from changes in general economic conditions, interest rates, credit markets, and other external factors. The risk of loss is increased during periods of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets as these factors could limit the ability of some issuers to repay their debt obligations. If the carrying value of the Company\u2019s investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company will be required to write down the value of its investments, which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition affects the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe title insurance industry is highly competitive. Key competitive factors are quality of service, price within regulatory parameters, expertise, timeliness and the financial strength and size of the insurer. Title insurance underwriters compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company-owned operations, independent agents and issuing agency relationships with real estate attorneys, subsidiaries of community and regional lending institutions, realtors, builders and other settlement service providers. Title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service, technology and commission levels. Some title insurers currently have greater financial resources, larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and information than the Company. The number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the Company operates, and any reductions to current regulatory barriers within any of the different geographic areas could increase the number of competitors entering into the title insurance market. Competition among the major providers of title insurance or the acceptance of alternative products to traditional title products by the regulatory authorities and the marketplace could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations. Changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulations that are intended to protect policyholders and consumers.\nThe nature and extent of state regulations, which vary from state to state, typically involve, among other matters, licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nlicensing of insurers and agents;\n\u2022\ncapital and surplus requirements;\n\u2022\napproval of premium rates for insurance;\n\u2022\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company;\n\u2022\nfiling of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition;\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nestablishing reserves;\n\u2022\naccounting and financing practices;\n\u2022\ndeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022\ntrade and marketing practices;\n\u2022\nregulation of reinsurance;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms; and\n\u2022\nuse of personal information.\nInsurance holding companies are subject to periodic examinations and the regulation of acquisitions, intercompany transactions and changes in control, among others, by state regulators.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain federal regulations established by the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Federal Reserve and various other governmental agencies. Title insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations by the CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has extensive regulatory and enforcement authority over the RESPA, the primary federal regulatory guidance covering the real estate settlement industry. Additionally, the CFPB has issued extensive regulations for the integration of mortgage disclosure which require implementation by August 15, 2015. Extensive efforts by market participants, including the Company, are required to implement these regulations. New regulations, or differing interpretations of existing laws, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s other businesses also operate within state and federal guidelines. Any changes in the regulatory environment could restrict its existing or future operations and could possibly make it more burdensome and costly to conduct them.\nTitle insurance rate regulation could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRates for title insurance vary by state and are subject to extensive regulation. The process of implementing a rate change in most states involves pre-approval by the applicable state insurance regulator. This regulation could impact the Company\u2019s ability to adjust prices in the face of rapidly changing market conditions, which could adversely affect results of operations.\nA downgrade from a rating agency could result in a loss of underwriting business.\nThe competitive positions of title insurance companies rely partly on ratings published by independent rating services. Government sponsored entities and lending institutions utilize these ratings, among other items, to evaluate a title insurer\u2019s strength and stability. The Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries are currently rated by A.M. Best Company, Kroll Bond Agency and Demotech, Inc. The ratings issued by independent rating agencies are not credit ratings, but represent the opinion of the individual rating agency in regards to the title insurance subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet policy holder obligations. These insurer ratings are subject to periodic review and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. A significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries could negatively impact the ability to compete for new business, retain existing business and maintain the necessary licenses to operate as title insurance companies in various states.\nFinancial institution failures could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company has substantial deposits, including deposits that are owned by third parties, with financial institutions. There is no guarantee the Company, whether through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or otherwise, would recover the funds it has deposited should one or more of the financial institutions at which the Company maintains deposits fail.\nThe Company may encounter difficulties managing system or technological changes, which could adversely affect its financial and operating results.\nTechnological changes in the title insurance industry are driven primarily by evolution in technology, competitive factors, and regulatory changes. These changes have resulted in faster information delivery and efficient, highly automated production processes. The inability of the Company to manage, develop or successfully implement new systems or technological changes could negatively impact profitability.\nThe Company relies on distributions from its insurance subsidiaries.\nThe Company is an insurance holding company and it has no substantial operations of its own. Its principal assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries, primarily its insurance subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent, among other factors, on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay intercompany loans. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends, loans or advances they can make to the Company. The restriction on these amounts is based on the amount of the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 unassigned surplus and net income, with certain adjustments. Additionally, these subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital, surplus and reserves. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $90,384,000 of consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity represents the net assets of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries that cannot be transferred in the form of dividends, loans or advances to the Company. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require prior approval by the appropriate regulatory body. These dividend restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or fund growth opportunities.\nRegulatory investigations of the title insurance industry by governmental entities could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe title insurance industry is subject to increased scrutiny by both federal and state regulators focusing on violations of state insurance codes, RESPA and similar state and federal laws, among others. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries routinely receive inquiries from regulators involving market conduct. Future inquiries could lead to fines for violations, settlements with regulating authorities that could result in fines or requirements to pay claims and the potential for further regulation, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents, and its inability to do so could adversely affect its business.\nCompetition for skilled and experienced personnel in the Company\u2019s industry is high, and the success of the Company is substantially dependent on its ability to attract and retain such personnel. The Company may have difficulty hiring and retaining the necessary marketing and management personnel to support future growth plans. Also, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining new agents.\nPolicies and procedures for the mitigation of risk may not be sufficient.\nThe Company has policies and procedures in place to help identify, analyze, and measure the risks associated with the issuance of title insurance policies, investment risks, interest rate risks and legal risks, among others. Because a significant degree of judgment is involved with the establishment of policies and processes as well as the measurement of risks, it is possible not all risks have been identified or anticipated. Misidentified or unanticipated risks could adversely impact the Company and its results of operations.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by the possible reform of government-sponsored enterprises.\nThe federal government is currently in discussions regarding reform of The Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac often require the purchase of title insurance for home loans they securitize. Changes to these entities could impact the entire mortgage loan process and as a result, could impact the demand for title insurance. The timing and results of reform are currently unknown; however, changes to these entities could adversely impact the Company and its results of operations.\nUnauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems, or other system interruptions, and unauthorized data disclosures may harm the Company\u2019s reputation, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, or result in monetary losses.\nThe Company utilizes electronic systems to deliver products and services, and to conduct major aspects of its business. The Company uses electronic systems to receive, process, store, and transmit data, including non-public consumer and financial information. Non-public information may include, among other things, names, addresses, social security numbers, and banking information. In addition, the Company utilizes electronic systems to receive and transfer money. Events beyond control of the Company, including unauthorized system intrusions, fraud, user input errors, telecommunication failures or natural disasters could disrupt operations both internally and externally, release proprietary and/or non-public information, cause significant loss of corporate funds, or damage corporate assets. To counter these risks, the Company invests significant resources in maintaining the security of our network and adapting to evolving security threats. In addition, the Company further mitigates risks by maintaining cyber-liability insurance coverage.\nThe Company may encounter difficulties managing growth, which could adversely affect its results.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth plans involve expansion into new geographic locations and further penetration in established markets. Expansion into new markets may subject the Company to associated risks, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention and other risks related to establishing operations in new territories.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s shareholder rights plan may deter or discourage a takeover of the Company.\nThe Company has adopted a shareholders rights plan. The rights set forth in the plan are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company, and we believe the rights would be beneficial to the Company and its shareholders in the event of negotiations with a potential acquirer. However, the shareholder rights plan could discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that may involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the Company\u2019s common shareholders.", "PERMNO": 10901, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "ITIC"}
