{"cik": "1651052", "company": "Focus Financial Partners Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the information in this Annual Report and the following risks. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Capital Markets and Competition\nOur financial results largely depend on wealth management fees received by our partner firms, which are impacted by market fluctuations.\nThe substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the wealth management fees charged by our partner firms for providing clients with investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. A material portion of these wealth management fees are calculated based on a contractual percentage of the client\u2019s assets. Wealth management fees may be adversely affected by prolonged declines in the capital markets because assets of clients may decline and clients may reduce or eliminate the amount of their assets with respect to which our partner firms provide advice, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur partner firms may not be able to maintain their current wealth management fee structure.\nOur partner firms may not be able to maintain their current wealth management fee structure for any number of reasons, including as a result of poor investment performance, competitive pressures or changes in their mix of wealth management services. In order to maintain their fee structure in a competitive environment, our partner firms must be able to continue to provide clients with services that their clients believe justify their fees. Any decline in fee rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe wealth management industry is very competitive.\nWe compete for acquisition opportunities and our partner firms compete for clients, advisers and other personnel with a broad range of wealth management firms, including public and privately held investment advisers, firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, private equity firms and insurance companies, many of whom have greater resources than we do. The wealth management industry is very competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including the ability to attract and retain key wealth management professionals, investment performance, wealth management fee rates, the quality of services provided to clients, the depth and continuity of client relationships and adherence to the fiduciary standard and reputation. A number of factors, including the following, serve to increase the competitive risks of our partner firms: (i) many competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, name recognition and other resources and more personnel than our partner firms do, (ii) potential competitors have a relatively low cost of entering the wealth management industry, (iii) some competitors may invest according to different investment styles or in alternative asset classes that the markets may perceive as more attractive than the investment strategies our partner firms offer, (iv) some competitors charge lower fees for their wealth management services than our partner firms do and (v) some competitors may be able to engage in more widespread marketing activities or may have access to products and services to which our partner firms do not. If we are unable to compete effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur clients can terminate their client service contracts at any time.\nOur clients can generally terminate their client service contracts with us at any time. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our existing clients or attract new clients, and these client service contracts and client relationships may be terminated or not renewed for any number of reasons. In particular, poor wealth management\nservice or performance of the investment strategies that our partner firms recommend relative to the performance of other wealth management firms could result in the loss of accounts.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to facilitate smooth succession planning.\nWe cannot predict with certainty how long the principals or employees of our partner firms will continue working, and upon the retirement or exit of a principal or employee, a partner firm\u2019s business may be adversely affected. If we are not successful in facilitating succession planning of our partner firms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business and the businesses of our partner firms are heavily dependent on our reputations.\nOur business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our partner firms and the clients of our partner firms. Our reputation is critical to our business and is vulnerable to threats that may be difficult or impossible to control and costly or impossible to remediate. For example, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, errors in our public reports or litigation or the publicity surrounding these events, even if satisfactorily addressed, could adversely impact our reputation, our relationships with our partner firms and the clients of our partner firms and our ability to negotiate acquisitions and partner firm-level acquisitions with wealth management firms, as well as adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reliance on our partner firms to report their results to us may make it difficult to respond quickly to negative business developments.\nWe rely on our partner firms to report their results to us on a monthly basis. We have implemented common general ledger, payroll and cash management systems that allow us to monitor the financial performance and overall operations of our partner firms. However, if our partner firms delay reporting results or informing us of negative business developments, we may not be able to address the situation on a timely basis, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risks could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe and our partner firms have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk in our business. Some of our risk evaluation methods depend upon information provided by our partner firms and others and public information regarding markets, clients or other matters. In some cases, however, that information may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. While we currently believe that our operational controls are effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the internal and external risks in our business in a timely manner. Furthermore, we may have errors in our business processes or fail to implement proper procedures in operating our business, which may expose us to risk of financial loss. We are also subject to the risk that our employees or contractors, the employees or contractors of our partner firms or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with our and our partner firms\u2019 controls, policies and procedures. The financial and reputational impact of control failures could be significant.\nThe potential for human error in connection with the operational systems of Focus Inc. or its partner firms could disrupt operations, cause losses or lead to regulatory fines.\nThe operations of Focus Inc. and its partner firms are dependent on its employees and principals. From time-to-time, employees or principals may make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems and controls and policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in inputting orders, errors in software implementation, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, follow regulations or internal compliance procedures or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines or sanctions, breach of client\ncontracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain and properly safeguard an adequate technology infrastructure and to protect against cyber-attacks may limit our growth, result in losses or disrupt our business.\nOur business is reliant upon financial, accounting and technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information, and to conduct many business activities and transactions with clients, advisers, vendors and other third parties. The failure to implement, maintain and safeguard an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we rely heavily on third parties for certain aspects of our business, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, and these parties are also susceptible to similar risks.\nAlthough we and our partner firms take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software, networks and mobile devices, and those of third parties on whom we rely, have been subject to and may in the future be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, breaches, unauthorized access, theft, including wire and check fraud, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. Further, our back-up procedures, cyber defenses and capabilities in the event of a failure, interruption or breach of security may not be adequate. If any such events occur, it could jeopardize our, as well as our clients\u2019, employees\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other sensitive information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our or third-party computer systems, networks and mobile devices or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019, employees\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 operations. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and networks, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all threats, especially because the techniques used change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources. As a result, we could experience business disruptions, significant losses, increased costs, reputational harm, regulatory actions or legal liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may in the future be required to spend significant additional resources to modify existing protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, including hiring third-party technology service providers and additional information technology staff. Additionally, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against fully or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain.\nFocus and its partner firms are dependent on a number of key vendors.\nFocus and its partner firms depend on a number of key vendors for various accounting, custody, brokerage and trading, software and technology systems and other operational needs (\u201cKey Vendors\u201d). Moreover, while Focus and its partner firms perform diligence on its Key Vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, Focus or its partner firms may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose Focus or its partner firms to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to Focus or its partner firms.\nThe duration of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCovid-19\u201d) outbreak and its ultimate impact on our business remains uncertain.\nThe transmission of Covid-19 and efforts to contain its spread have resulted in border closings and other travel restrictions and disruptions, disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity, event cancellations and restrictions, service cancellations and reductions, significant challenges in the healthcare industry and quarantines. These impacts and the uncertainty around the future impact of Covid-19, including the extent and duration of the impact on economies around the world, have caused significant volatility in the U.S and global financial markets, which are expected to impact our partner firms\u2019 investment strategies and the wealth management fee revenues of our partner firms.\nOur market correlated revenues for subsequent periods could be impacted by any negative effects of Covid-19 on the financial markets. Additionally, the cancellation of events and the general slowdown of other entertainment activities have impacted and are expected to continue to impact a portion of our non-market correlated revenues that are derived from family office type services for clients in the entertainment industry and relate to live events. We anticipate that the ongoing cancellations of live events and slowdown of other entertainment activities will persist in 2021. Furthermore, the effects of Covid-19 may impact the timing and our ability to pursue and make future acquisitions.\nAlthough currently there has been no significant impact, the Covid-19 outbreak, and future pandemics, could negatively affect Key Vendors which we and our partner firms rely on, and could otherwise disrupt the ability of our Key Vendors to perform essential tasks.\nRisks Related to Our Partnership Model and Growth Strategy\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to make successful acquisitions.\nOur continued success will depend, in part, upon our ability to find suitable firms to acquire, either directly or on behalf of our existing partner firms, our ability to acquire such firms on acceptable terms and our ability to raise the capital necessary to finance such transactions. We compete with banks, outsourced service providers, private equity firms and other wealth management and advisory firms to acquire high-quality wealth management firms. Some of our competitors may be able to outbid us for these acquisition targets. If we identify suitable acquisition targets, we may not be able to complete any such acquisition on terms that are commercially acceptable to us. If we are not successful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates, it may have an adverse effect on our business and on our earnings and revenue growth.\nAcquired businesses may not perform as expected and our due diligence process might not uncover all risk or liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our partner firms\u2019 and our earnings and revenue growth: (i) incurring costs in excess of, or achieving synergies less than, what we anticipated; (ii) potential loss of key wealth management professionals or other team members of the predecessor firm; (iii) inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset transaction costs; (iv) inability to retain clients following an acquisition; (v) incurring expenses associated with the amortization or impairment of intangible assets, particularly for goodwill and other intangible assets; and (vi) payment of more than fair market value for the assets of the partner firm.\nWhile we intend that our completed acquisitions will improve profitability, past or future acquisitions may not be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet operational or strategic expectations. The failure of any partner firm to perform as expected after acquisition may have an adverse effect on our earnings and revenue growth.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to such transactions. Despite our efforts, due diligence might not reveal all issues and existing and potential liabilities at a given firm.\nContingent consideration payments could result in a higher than expected impact on our future earnings.\nOur acquisition structures typically include contingent consideration paid to the sellers upon the achievement of specified financial thresholds. The contingent consideration for acquisitions of new partner firms is typically paid upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds typically over a six-year period, and for acquisitions made by our partner firms, upon the satisfaction of thresholds tied to revenue as adjusted for certain criteria or other operating metrics based on the retention or growth of the business acquired. These arrangements may result in the payment of additional\npurchase price consideration to the sellers for periods following the closing of an acquisition and payments may occur in periods subsequent to the periods in which the additional earnings or other specified financial thresholds are achieved.\nWe may incur debt, issue additional equity or use cash on hand to pay for future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our Class A common stock. Additionally, difficulty in obtaining debt, issuing equity or generating cash flow could affect our growth and financial condition and the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe will finance future acquisitions through debt financing, including significant draws on our first lien revolving credit facility (the \u201cFirst Lien Revolver\u201d), issuance of additional term debt, the issuance of equity securities, the use of existing cash or cash equivalents or any combination of the foregoing. Acquisitions financed with debt could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to principal and interest payments. Acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities would be dilutive to the share value and voting power of our existing Class A common stock, which could affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Future acquisitions financed with our own cash could deplete the cash and working capital available to fund our operations adequately. Difficulty borrowing funds, selling securities or generating sufficient cash from operations to finance our activities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe growth of Connectus may create unique challenges and risks.\nIn 2020, our partner firm Connectus completed acquisitions of wealth management firms and intends to acquire additional wealth management firms in the future. Connectus is different from our other partner firms in that we have a greater degree of management control over areas other than client service and investment operations. Additionally, Connectus is designed to offer integrated technology, investment support, regulatory compliance support and other centralized services on a countrywide basis. If these centralized services are not adequate, or other unanticipated issues with Connectus arise as it grows, such as inability to find a sufficient number of firms to merge into Connectus or integrate them effectively, then our reputation and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe success of Focus Independence depends upon our ability to lift out teams of wealth management professionals from traditional brokerages and wirehouses.\nOur ability to lift out teams of wealth management professionals from traditional brokerages and wirehouses depends on our ability to offer more favorable opportunities than those provided by their current employers, many of which have substantially greater financial resources and may be able to entice their employees to stay. If we are not successful in attracting and lifting out suitable wealth management professionals for our Focus Independence program, it may have an adverse effect on the growth of our revenues and earnings.\nWe may face operational risks associated with expanding internationally.\nOur business strategy includes expanding our presence in non-U.S. markets through acquisitions. This strategy presents a number of risks, including: (i) greater difficulties in supporting, or the need to hire additional personnel to support, the operations of foreign partner firms, (ii) language and cultural differences, (iii) unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, (iv) higher operating costs, (v) unexpected changes in wealth management policies and other regulatory requirements, (vi) adverse tax consequences and (vii) more complex acquisition structures. If our international business increases relative to our total business, these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model and Key Professionals\nOur partner firms\u2019 autonomy limits our ability to alter their management practices and policies, and our dependence on the principals who manage the businesses of our partner firms may have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnder the management agreements between our partner firms and the management companies formed by the principals, the management companies provide the personnel who manage the partner firm\u2019s day-to-day operations and oversee the provision of wealth management and other financial services, the implementation of employment policies, the negotiation, execution and delivery of contracts in connection with the management and operation of the partner firm\u2019s business in the ordinary course and the implementation of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Such individuals also maintain the primary relationships with clients and vendors. As a consequence, we are exposed to losses resulting from day-to-day decisions of the principals who manage our partner firm, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by problems stemming from the day-to-day operations of a partner firm, where weaknesses or failures in internal processes or systems could lead to a disruption of the partner firm\u2019s operations, liability to its clients or exposure to disciplinary action. Unsatisfactory performance by the principals could also hinder the partner firms\u2019 ability to grow and could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, there is a risk of reputational harm to us if any of our partner firms, among other things, have engaged in, or in the future were to engage in, poor or non-compliant business practices or were to experience adverse results.\nWe rely on our key personnel and principals.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers, other management team members, employees and principals. Our executive officers, in particular, play an important role in the stability and growth of our business, including the growth and stability of existing partner firms and in identifying potential acquisition opportunities for us. However, there is no guarantee that these officers will remain with us. In addition, our partner firms depend heavily on the services of key principals, who in many cases have managed their predecessor firms for many years. Although we use a combination of economic incentives, transfer restrictions and non-solicitation and non-competition agreements in an effort to retain key management personnel, there is no guarantee that these principals will remain with the respective partner firms. The loss of key management personnel at our partner firms could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf a management company terminates its management agreement with us, our financial condition and results could be negatively affected.\nAt the time of the acquisition of a partner firm, we enter into a management agreement with the management company that is substantially owned by the selling principals. Pursuant to the management agreement, the management company provides the personnel who conduct the day to day management and operation of the partner firm. These management agreements can be terminated by the management company at the end of the initial term, which is typically six years. Termination of a management agreement could lead to a disruption of the partner firm\u2019s operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur partner firms may be unable to attract, develop and retain talented wealth management professionals.\nAttracting, developing and retaining talented wealth management and other financial services professionals are essential components of the business strategy of our partner firms. To do so, it is critical that they continue to foster an environment and provide compensation that is attractive for their existing and prospective wealth management professionals. If they are unsuccessful in maintaining such an environment (for instance, because of changes in management structure, corporate culture or corporate governance arrangements) or compensation levels for any reason, their existing wealth management professionals may leave the firm or fail to produce their best work on a consistent, long-term basis and/or our partner firms may be unsuccessful in attracting talented new wealth management professionals, any of which could negatively impact their financial results and our ability to grow and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nFocus Inc. is dependent upon distributions from Focus LLC. Additionally, to the extent Focus Inc. receives distributions in excess of its tax liabilities and other obligations and retains such excess cash, the unitholders of Focus LLC would benefit from such accumulated cash balances if they exercise their exchange right.\nFocus Inc. is a holding company and its most significant asset is its equity interest in Focus LLC. Focus Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Focus LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of Focus LLC\u2019s credit agreements and any other debt instruments, we have caused and intend to continue to cause Focus LLC to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including Focus Inc., in an amount generally intended to allow such unitholders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Focus LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions (and actual liability in the case of Focus Inc.), and to allow Focus Inc. to make payments under its three and any subsequent tax receivable agreements (\u201cTax Receivable Agreements\u201d), and (ii) non pro rata distributions to Focus Inc. in an amount at least sufficient to reimburse Focus Inc. for its corporate and other overhead expenses. We are limited, however, in our ability to cause Focus LLC and its subsidiaries to make these and other distributions to Focus Inc. due to the restrictions under our credit facilities entered into in July 2017, as amended (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). Funds used by Focus LLC to satisfy its distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business. To the extent that Focus Inc. needs funds and Focus LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Focus Inc.\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to Focus Inc. and to the other Focus LLC unitholders, as well as the use of an assumed tax rate in calculating Focus LLC\u2019s tax distribution obligations, Focus Inc. may receive distributions significantly in excess of its tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements. If Focus Inc. retains such cash balances, the unitholders of Focus LLC would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of their exercise of an exchange right.\nFocus Inc. is required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements for certain tax benefits it may claim, and the amounts of such payments is expected to be substantial.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreements generally provide for the payment by Focus Inc. to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that Focus Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements are Focus Inc.\u2019s obligations and not obligations of Focus LLC, and we expect that such payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreements is by its nature imprecise. Please read \u201cPart II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreements.\u201d\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements.\nIf we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreements, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the Tax Receivable Agreements terminate early (at our election or as a result of our breach), Focus Inc. could be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. This payment would equal the present value of hypothetical future payments that could be required to be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreements (determined by applying a discount rate of one-year London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 1.5%). The calculation of hypothetical future payments will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreements, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payments relate.\nAny such accelerated payments could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Please read \u201cPart II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreements.\u201d\nAs a result of this payment obligation, holders of our Class A common stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Further, any payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements will not be conditioned upon the TRA holders\u2019 having a continued interest in Focus Inc. or Focus LLC. Accordingly, the TRA holders\u2019 interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreements in the event that any tax benefits are subsequently disallowed.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreements if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any TRA holder will be netted against payments that would otherwise be made to such TRA holder, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIf Focus LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, significant tax inefficiencies might result.\nA number of aspects of our structure depend on the classification of Focus LLC as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While Focus LLC has taken steps to avail itself of safe harbors to protect itself from being treated as a \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d under U.S. Treasury regulations, such a treatment would likely result in significant tax inefficiencies, including as a result of Focus Inc.\u2019s inability to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with Focus LLC. In addition, Focus Inc. would no longer have the benefit of the increases in tax basis covered under the Tax Receivable Agreements, and Focus Inc. would not be able to recover any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreements, even if the corresponding tax benefits (including any claimed increase in the tax basis of Focus LLC\u2019s assets) were subsequently determined to have been unavailable.\nRisks Related to Financing and Liquidity\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of approximately $1.5 billion at stated value and in January 2021, we increased the term loan borrowings under our Credit Facility by $500.0 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness including the Credit Facility, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions or partner firm-level acquisitions and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis could\nharm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The Credit Facility currently restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. While we expect any such alternative to be a reasonable replacement for LIBOR, at this time we cannot predict the implications of the use of such a new benchmark on the interest rates we pay.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nThe Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants, including (i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, (ii) creating liens or other encumbrances on property or granting negative pledges, (iii) entering into a merger or similar transaction, (iv) selling or transferring certain property and (v) declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings, to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of acquisitions or other business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility impose on us.\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Facility would result in a default under the applicable agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow on short notice sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\nOur business is highly regulated.\nOur partner firms are subject to extensive regulation by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. See \u201cPart I. Item 1, Business-Regulatory Environment.\u201d\nProviding investment advice to clients is regulated on both the federal and state level in the United States. Our partner firms are predominantly investment advisers registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Each firm that is a federally registered investment adviser is regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Some of our partner firms manage registered and unregistered funds that subject them to additional disclosure and compliance requirements. The failure to comply with the Advisers Act and other securities laws and regulations could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations, including censure or terminating their SEC registrations and could also result in litigation or reputational harm. In addition, our partner firms who are investment advisers are subject to notice filings and the anti-fraud rules of state securities regulators and certain individuals are subject to state registration in many instances under applicable state securities laws.\nOur U.S. partner firms are also subject to regulation by the DOL under ERISA and related regulations with respect to investment advisory and management services provided to retirement plans and plan participants covered by ERISA and by the IRS with respect to IRAs pursuant to comparable provisions within the IRC. Among other\nrequirements, ERISA and the IRC impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and the IRC, respectively, and prohibits certain transactions involving related parties.\nCertain of our partner firms have affiliated SEC-registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their personnel are regulated, to a large extent, by the SEC and self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA and are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business Further, certain of our partner firms have licensed insurance affiliates. State insurance laws grant supervisory agencies, including state insurance departments, broad administrative authority.\nAdditionally, we and our partner firms are subject to various data privacy and cybersecurity laws designed to protect client and employee personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of client or employee personal, financial or other data could expose us to potential financial penalties and legal liability. Further, we and our partner firms are subject to anti-corruption laws and certain of our firms are subject to anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as regulation and enforcement by agencies charged with administering those laws.\nOur international operations are subject to additional non-U.S. regulatory requirements.\nWe have partner firms located in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. We may have partner firms located in other non-U.S. jurisdictions in the future. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, directives, notices or guidelines in any jurisdiction outside of the United States could result in a wide range of penalties and disciplinary actions, including fines, censures and the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and operations and our partner firms in those jurisdictions. Regulators in jurisdictions outside of the United States could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede the ability of such partner firms to offer wealth management services in their respective markets, or they may be unable to keep up with, or adapt to, changing, complex regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions or markets, which could further negatively impact our business.\nIn the future, we may further expand our business outside of the markets in which we currently operate in such a way or to such an extent that we may be required to register with additional foreign regulatory agencies or otherwise comply with additional non-U.S. laws and regulations that do not currently apply to us. Lack of compliance with any such non-U.S. laws and regulations may increase our risk of becoming party to litigation and subject to regulatory actions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that our differentiated partnership model might not be enforceable in some non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe regulatory environment in which our partner firms operate is subject to continuous change, and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which our partner firms operate has undergone significant changes in the recent past. Regulatory review or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations may result in the enactment of new laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operations or our ability to conduct business profitably. We are unable to predict whether any such laws or regulations will be enacted and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our business. See \u201cPart I. Item 1, Business - Regulatory Environment.\u201d\nOur business is subject to risks related to legal proceedings and governmental inquiries.\nOur business is subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and claims arising in the normal course of operations. The risks associated with these matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nOur partner firms depend to a large extent on their network of relationships and on their reputation to attract and retain clients. The principals and other wealth management professionals at our partner firms make investment decisions on behalf of clients that could result in substantial losses. If clients suffer significant losses, or are otherwise dissatisfied\nwith wealth management services, we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and/or fraud. Moreover, our partner firms are predominantly U.S. RIAs and have a legal obligation to operate under the fiduciary standard, a heightened standard as compared to the standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers. These risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time, even after an action has been commenced.\nOur involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur additional legal and other costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines, damages and other costs, perhaps in material amounts. Regardless of final costs, these matters could have an adverse effect on our business by exposing us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our partner firms\u2019 client relationships or diversion of personnel and management resources.\nPrincipal or employee misconduct or disclosure of confidential information could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because our partner firms operate in an industry in which personal relationships, integrity and the confidence of clients are of critical importance. The principals and employees at our partner firms could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if a principal or employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities, a partner firm could be subject to regulatory sanctions and we could suffer serious harm to our reputation (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), our financial position, our partner firms\u2019 client relationships and their ability to attract new clients.\nThe wealth management business often requires that we deal with confidential information. If principals or employees at our partner firms were to improperly use or disclose this information, even if inadvertently, we or our partner firms could be subject to legal action and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships or those of our partner firms. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. Misconduct by principals or employees at our partner firms, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in an adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nFailure to properly disclose conflicts of interest and comply with fiduciary duty requirements could harm our reputation, business and results of operations.\nSome of our partner firms have affiliated SEC-registered broker-dealers and licensed insurance affiliates, which create conflicts of interests. Certain of our partner firms also have compensation arrangements pursuant to which they receive payments based on client assets invested in certain third-party mutual funds. Such arrangements allow a partner firm to receive payments from multiple parties based on the same client asset and can incentivize a partner firm to act in a manner contrary to the best interests of its clients. As investment advisers subject to a legal obligation to operate under the fiduciary standard, these partner firms must fully disclose any conflicts between their interests and those of their clients. The SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, and our partner firms have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate conflicts of interest. However, if our partner firms fail to fully disclose conflicts of interest or if their policies and procedures are not effective, they could face reputational damage, litigation or regulatory proceedings or penalties, any of which may adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions of newly established RIA firms formed by teams of wealth management professionals formerly employed at traditional brokerages and wirehouses expose us to litigation risk.\nAs part of the Focus Independence program, we have to date, with limited exceptions, acquired substantially all of the assets of new RIA firms formed by teams of wealth management professionals formerly employed at traditional brokerages and wirehouses. These acquisitions may expose us to the risk of legal actions alleging misappropriation of confidential information, including client information, unfair competition, and breach of contract. These risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time, even after an action has been commenced. We may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation\ncommenced by a brokerage or wirehouse. Substantial legal liability could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or cause significant reputational harm to us.\nIn the event of a change of control of our company, we may be required to obtain the consent of our partner firms\u2019 advisory clients to the change of control.\nAs required by the Advisers Act, the investment advisory agreements entered into by our investment adviser subsidiaries provide that an \u201cassignment\u201d of the agreement may not be made without the client\u2019s consent. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), advisory agreements with registered funds provide that they terminate automatically upon \u201cassignment\u201d and the board of directors and the shareholders of the registered fund must approve a new agreement for advisory services to continue. Under both the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, a change of ownership may constitute such an \u201cassignment\u201d if it is a change of control. For example, under certain circumstances, an assignment may be deemed to occur if a controlling block of voting securities is transferred, if any party acquires control, or, in certain circumstances, if a controlling party gives up control. Under the Investment Company Act, a 25% voting interest is presumed to constitute control. An assignment or a change of control could be deemed to occur in the future if we, or one of our investment adviser subsidiaries, were to gain or lose a controlling person, or in other situations that may depend significantly on facts and circumstances. In any such case we would seek to obtain the consent of our advisory clients, including any funds, to the assignment. To the extent of any failure to obtain these consents, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock, Ownership and Governance\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our Class A common stock may not be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile.\nPrior to July 2018, our Class A common stock was not traded on any market. An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our Class A common stock may not be maintained. Active, liquid and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. The market price of our Class A common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our Class A common stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Class A common stock.\nIf our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we have provided to the public or the expectations of our investors and analysts, our stock price may decline.\nWe provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management\u2019s expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided or the expectations of our investors and analysts, especially in times of economic uncertainty. In the past, when results have differed from such guidance or expectations, the market price of our common stock has declined. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of our investors and analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nInvestment vehicles affiliated with our private equity investors own a substantial percentage of the voting power of our common stock.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. As of February 15, 2021, investment vehicles affiliated with Stone Point Capital LLC (together with its affiliates, \u201cStone Point\u201d) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with its affiliates, \u201cKKR\u201d or, together with Stone Point, the \u201cPE Holders\u201d) collectively owned approximately 32.5% of our Class A common stock (representing\n20.5% of the economic interest and 23.2% of the voting power) and 69.1% of our Class B common stock (representing 0% of the economic interest and 19.9% of the voting power).\nAlthough the PE Holders are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their stock in us, they together hold almost enough voting power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby to control our management and affairs. Additionally, the PE Holders have the right to nominate an aggregate of three members of our board of directors for so long as they maintain certain ownership stakes. The PE Holders are likely able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and are able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company. The existence of significant shareholders may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nMoreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of our company.\nThe interests of the PE Holders may differ from those of our public shareholders.\nSo long as the PE Holders continue to control a significant amount of our common stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, regardless of whether or not other shareholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of the PE Holders (including their interests, if any, as TRA holders) may differ or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. For example, the PE Holders may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreements, and whether and when Focus Inc. should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreements and accelerate its obligations thereunder; provided that any decision to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreements and accelerate the obligations thereunder would also require the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors of Focus Inc. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the PE Holders\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See \u201cPart II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Tax Receivable Agreements.\u201d\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, repurchase rights, liquidation preferences or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A common stock. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the value or our Class A common stock. Furthermore, if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. For example, our board of directors may grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the occurrence of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions.\nIn addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including: (i) prohibiting us from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) establishing advance notice provisions with regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our shareholders, (iii) providing that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors, (iv) providing that all vacancies in our board of directors may, except as otherwise be required, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office,\neven if less than a quorum, (v) providing that our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding voting stock, (vi) providing for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, (vii) providing that our amended and restated bylaws can be amended by the board of directors, (viii) limitations on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings, (ix) limitations on the ability of shareholders to act by written consent, (x) requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting stock held by affiliates of Stone Point and KKR, for so long as they collectively own at least 25% of our outstanding voting stock, to amend, alter, repeal or rescind certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and (xi) renouncing any reasonable expectancy interest that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any corporate or business opportunities that are from time to time presented to Stone Point, KKR, directors affiliated with these parties and their respective affiliates.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or trustees to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the federal securities laws of the United States. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not have any current plans to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. Consequently, the only opportunity that holders of our Class A common stock will have to achieve a return on their investment in our Class A common stock is if the price of our Class A common stock appreciates.\nWe do not have any current plans to declare dividends on shares of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the only opportunity that holders of our Class A common stock will have to achieve a return on their investment in our Class A common stock will be if they sell their shares of Class A common stock at a price greater than they may pay for them. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A common stock will ever exceed the price that a holder of our Class A common stock may pay for them.\nFuture sales or other issuances of our Class A common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nUnitholders of Focus LLC (other than Focus Inc. and any of its subsidiaries) may receive shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of an exchange right or the call right and then sell those shares of Class A common stock. Additionally, we may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or convertible securities in subsequent offerings or as consideration for future acquisitions.\nWe have approximately 6,800,000 shares of our Class A common stock registered under our registration statements on Form S-8 for additional issuances under our equity incentive plan, that are available for resale in the public market without restriction, subject to the satisfaction of vesting, the requirements of Rule 144 and any other conditions.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts or other issuances of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.\nWe have and may in the future finance acquisitions of partner firms by issuing equity securities that could be dilutive to shareholders.\nWe have and may in the future finance acquisitions through the issuance of equity securities, including Focus LLC common units and our Class A common stock. Acquisitions financed with the issuance of Focus LLC common units could significantly reduce our percentage ownership of Focus LLC. Furthermore, the new holders of Focus LLC common units may receive shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of an exchange right or the call right, which could impact shareholders.\nAcquisitions financed with the issuance of our Class A common stock could be dilutive to the share value and voting power of our existing Class A common stock, which could affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.\nWe maintain voluntary and required insurance coverage, including, among others, general liability, property, director and officer, errors and omissions, network security and privacy, fidelity bond and fiduciary liability insurance, and insurance required under ERISA. While we endeavor to purchase coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of our risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. Our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable. In addition, insurance claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.\nIf our system of internal controls has flaws, weaknesses or otherwise is not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could result in a loss of investor confidence.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\nShould we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquake, hurricane or other natural or man made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. Further, we could potentially lose client data or experience adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to clients in a\ndisaster recovery scenario, which could result in material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.", "PERMNO": 17950, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FOCS"}
