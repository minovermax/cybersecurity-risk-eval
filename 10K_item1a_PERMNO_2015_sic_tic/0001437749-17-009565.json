RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our shares of common stock and related derivative securities involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in this Report before making an investment decision. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, you may lose all or part of your investment. Some factors in this section are forward-looking statements.\nWe may continue to experience significant losses from operations.\nWe have experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since our inception. Our loss from operations was $3.18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. We may, or may not, be profitable in the future. Even if we are profitable in one or more future years, subsequent developments in the economy, our industry, customer base, business or cost structure, or an event such as significant litigation or a significant transaction, may cause us to again experience losses.\nWe may not be able to raise sufficient equity capital to finance our operations due to our operating results, the lack of a market for our common stock and similar factors.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $0.2 million in restricted cash and approximately $8.06 million in debt coming due during 2017 and approximately $37.95 million payable in and after 2018. We expect that in the future we will again need to raise capital. With respect to any such capital raise, we may be unable to raise the amount of capital needed and may be forced to pay an extremely high price for capital. Factors affecting the availability and price of capital may include the following:\n\u25a0\nmarket factors affecting the availability and cost of capital generally, including increases or decreases in major stock market indexes, the stability of the banking and investment banking systems and general economic stability or instability;\n\u25a0\nwhether or stock is quoted on a stock market or listed on an exchange (which it currently is not);\n\u25a0\nour financial results, particularly the amount of revenue we are generating from product sales;\n\u25a0\nthe market's perception of our ability to execute our business plan and any specific projects identified as uses of proceeds;\n\u25a0\nour ownership structure and recent or anticipated dilution;\n\u25a0\nthe amount of our capital needs;\n\u25a0\nour project investment requirements in China;\n\u25a0\nthe amount of our outstanding debt;\n\u25a0\nthe extent to which we are subject to material legal or regulatory proceeding or restrictions arising from such proceedings;\n\u25a0\nthe influence of EST China and its appointees on the Board of Directors which, among other things, may cause the Company to seek indebtedness as a source of capital, as opposed to the sale of capital stock, in order to permit EST China to maintain control;\n\u25a0\nthe absence of public information about our company;\n\u25a0\nthe perception by potential investor of our company and companies in our line of business; and\n\u25a0\nthe economics of projects being pursued.\nIf we are unable to raise required capital, we may be forced to discontinue operations.\nThe significant amount of debt we owe creates a material risk of default and insolvency.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $8.06 million in debt that will come due in the next twelve months and approximately $37.95 million payable in and after 2018. This debt is secured by machinery and equipment, land use rights in China, third party guarantee, related party guarantee, and our building in Reno, Nevada. We do not have sufficient capital to repay such debt. If we are unable to refinance this debt, or otherwise raise sufficient capital to repay this debt, we will default. If we are in default, our creditors have a broad range of remedies, including taking action against the collateral. A default on our indebtedness, particularly that secured by our land use rights in China, would likely lead to our insolvency and a bankruptcy or similar event. In such a context, it is unlikely that there will be any amount available for distribution to its shareholders.\nOur business is dependent upon two customers, both of which are affiliates of our majority shareholder.\nDuring 2016, 84% of our revenue came from the sale of our nLTO powder to two customers in the electric bus business, both of which are affiliates of our majority shareholder EST China. We expect our dependence upon these customers to continue in the foreseeable future. If one or both of these customers were to experience a business slowdown or begin purchasing substitute products from another provider, our business would be harmed. This concentration also give these customer leverage in any negotiation with regard to price and other terms. Any use of this leverage could harm our business and ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have entered into contractual provisions that may significantly limit our ability to raise capital.\nIn conjunction with the closing of the purchase by EST China, an affiliate of Canon Investment Holdings Ltd. of shares representing over 50% of our outstanding shares in 2011, we granted certain rights to EST China, including the right to proportional representation on our Board of Directors, certain registration rights, and an option to purchase a sufficient number of our equity securities at market price to maintain their percentage of ownership should we offer, sell or issue new securities. These rights may dissuade potential investors from purchasing our capital or may require us to accept less than favorable terms in future financings.\nFluctuation in the value of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe change in value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar is affected by changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions, among other things, as well as government actions and policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation, or depreciation, of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. As substantially all of our revenues and expenses are in RMB, an increase in the value of the RMB against the dollar would increase our expenses (and revenues) in U.S. dollars, and a decrease in the value of the RMB against the dollar would decrease our revenues (and our expenses) in U.S. dollars. In recent years, there has been a trend of the Chinese government permitting the RMB to decrease in value relative to the U.S. dollars which would reduce our revenue and profits, if any, as reported in U.S. dollars and reduce the value of money repatriated to the United States.\nWe are subject to various regulatory regimes, and may be adversely affected by inquiries, investigations and allegations that we have not complied with governing rules and laws.\nIn light of the ownership structure of our company and our lines of business, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulatory regimes in addition to those applicable to all businesses generally. For example, we were a reporting company registered under Section 12 under the Securities Exchange Act but were delisted in 2016 for failing to timely file our annual, quarterly and other reports. Such delisting does not eliminate our obligation under Section 12 under the Securities Exchange Act to be a registered and reporting issuer due to the amount of our assets and the number of our stockholders. We are currently not in compliance with such registration obligation. The absence of such registration will limit our ability to raise capital and leaves us vulnerable to regulatory and shareholder laws suits. If we attempted to re-register under the Securities Exchange Act, we would expect to be subject to an extended review by the staff at the SEC. We are also subject to Delaware corporate laws and state and federal environmental, health, safety and similar laws. Such laws and rules change frequently and are often complex. In connection with such laws, we are subject to periodic audits, inquiries and investigations. Any such audits, inquiries and investigations may divert considerable financial and human resources and adversely affect the execution of our business plan.\nThrough such audits, inquiries and investigations, we or a regulator may determine that we are out of compliance with one or more governing rules or laws. Remedying such non-compliance would divert additional financial and human resources. In addition, in the future, we may be subject to a formal charge or determination that we have materially violated a governing law, rule or regulation. We may also be subject to lawsuits as a result of alleged violation of the securities laws or governing corporate laws. Any charge or allegation, and particularly any determination, that we had materially violated a governing law would harm our ability to enter into business relationships, recruit qualified officers and employees and raise capital.\nLaws governing repatriation of investments in a China WFOE may contribute to a need to obtain capital to finance our non-China operations in the near future.\nWe have established a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise, or WFOE, in China through which we directly or indirectly conduct our Chinese operations. When establishing a WFOE, we have been required to designate a minimum registered capital amount and contribute at least such amount to the WFOE. Chinese law severely limits the ability of a WFOE to repatriate money to its non-Chinese parent. In general, any distributions to the non-Chinese parent must derive from profits, as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our WFOE will also be required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on Chinese accounting standards each year to a statutory surplus reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as dividends.\nIn addition, our WFOE may be required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profit to a staff welfare and bonus fund. Moreover, if our WFOE incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict our WFOEs\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Any limitation on the ability of our WFOE to distribute dividends and other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to make investments or enter into joint ventures that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nU.S. news sources report that the Chinese government has placed, or began enforcing, limitations on lending by Chinese banks, which limits may affect our ability to borrow capital for our Chinese capital investment projects, for operations and to refinance existing debt.\nMany U.S. news sources have reported in recent years that, due to an increase in bad loans and other reasons, the Chinese government has imposed, or began enforcing, limitations on lending by Chinese banks and other lending entities. Northern Altair has been seeking loans from Chinese banks and other lending entities for its proposed capital investments and operations. This increased regulation and scrutiny may decrease the likelihood that Northern Altair can qualify for debt financing to fund proposed projects and to refinance existing indebtedness. Even if Northern Altair does qualify, terms of financing may be more onerous than anticipated. Any inability to finance our Chinese operations through debt would likely slow our growth in China and may prevent us from completing all aspects of our proposed nLTO and energy storage system manufacturing facility in China. Any failure to refinance existing indebtedness may lead to a default and insolvency.\nWe may become subject to international economic and political risks over which we have little or no control and may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid the possibility of reduced revenues.\nWe conduct substantially all our business outside the United States and plan to significantly increase our presence in China. Doing business outside the United States subjects us to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, major work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments and taxation. We have no control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate or adapt to changes in international economic and political conditions. This may lead to sudden and unexpected revenue reductions or expense increases.\nChina\u2019s economic policies, laws and regulations could affect our business.\nWhile China\u2019s economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of China, but they may also have a negative effect on us. For example, operating results and financial conditions may be adversely affected by the government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. The economy of China has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. In recent years, the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform and the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises; however, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the PRC government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. It also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, the control of payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, the setting of monetary policy and the provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could directly harm our business or harm overall economic growth in China, which in either case could increase our expenses and decrease expected revenues.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls internationally.\nWe are a small company with operation in multiple countries, particularly the United States and China. As a result of differences in management, accounting, legal, language and cultural norms, we may experience difficulty in establishing and enforcing management, legal and financial controls. We may also experience difficulty collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting standard business practices for our international projects as well as in our China-based operations. In fact, such difficulty is the principal reason that we failed to timely file required periodic reports beginning in 2013 and were deregistered as a reporting issuer in 2016. This issue also led to our delisting the Nasdaq Stock Market, the removal of our stock symbol by FINRA and various direct, derivative, regulatory and other investigations and lawsuits. This has harmed the price of our common stock, our ability to raise capital, our ability to sign agreements with customers and suppliers, our ability to retain key employees and hire replacement employees and other aspects of our business.\nSuch difficulties may continue in the future. Any failure to maintain controls, institute business practices or accurately collect information may have an effect on the efficiency of our business and could lead to a restatement, a regulatory action or a legal action, in addition to our inability to gain the trust of customers and suppliers.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nChina could change its policies toward private enterprise or even nationalize or expropriate private enterprises.\nOur business is expected to be subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be affected by political, economic and social developments in China. Over the past several years, the PRC government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The PRC government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little, if any, prior notice.\nChanges in policies, laws and regulations or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to shareholders, or devaluations of currency could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe nature and application of many laws of China create an uncertain environment for business operations and they could have a negative effect on us.\nThe legal system in China is a civil law system. Unlike the common-law system, the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. The promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could harm our business operations and financial condition. In addition, as these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. Furthermore, the political, governmental and judicial systems in China are sometimes impacted by corruption. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain recourse in any legal disputes with suppliers, customers or other parties with whom we conduct business.\nWe may not be able to sell the land use rights in China we have acquired, and expect to acquire, at appraised value or at all, in part due to applicable restrictions.\nIn October 2012, we acquired a 50-year land use right in China related to 66 acres of commercial land north of Dongzhuchang Village in Wu'an City, China. In May 2013, we acquired a 50-year land use right for an adjoining 40 acre parcel. Our land use rights are subject to certain requirements and limitations. In May 2014 and in August 2015, we purchased three more pieces of land. The requirements on the existing five land use rights, totaling 138.3 acres, include an obligation, over the life of the land use rights, to invest approximately $314.85 million in the combined projects. The limitations include a prohibition on the transfer of the land use right prior to our investment of at least 25% of our committed investment. These requirements and limitations may harm the value of the land use right.\nWe may face delays or related issues if we cannot effectively transfer know-how from our U.S.-based employees to our China-based employees.\nWe have constructed a facility in China to be the sole site for our nLTO manufacturing and an additional site for our energy storage system and module assembly. The processes of manufacturing nLTO and assembling energy storage systems and modules are complex. We will need to transfer the complex know-how for the manufacturing and assembly from our U.S.-based employees to our existing or new Chinese employees. Language and cultural differences, as well as the inherent difficulty of communicating skills learned through experience, may lead to difficulties in the education and training of Chinese employees. Any failure to adequately educate and train Chinese employees in company-specific know-how may result in additional costs, delays, quality concerns, warranty costs and other issues.\nFollowing the acquisition of a majority interest in the Company by EST China, we face risks associated with having a majority shareholder.\nIn July 2011, EST China acquired a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock. Having a controlling shareholder presents certain risks to us, including the following:\n\u25a0\nThe majority shareholder controls the appointments on the Board of Directors and may appoint persons less qualified, or more loyal to the majority shareholder, than would be appointed absent a controlling shareholder;\n\u25a0\nThe majority shareholder may be able to influence our Board of Directors to enter into transactions with related or third parties that are more favorable to such parties than would be negotiated by an independent Board of Directors;\n\u25a0\nWe may hire employees who also work for 100% owned subsidiaries of EST China, which may create conflicts of interest and concerns regarding protection of trade secrets\n\u25a0\nThe majority shareholder controls all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including any determination with respect to the acquisition or disposition of assets, future issuances of a material number of securities and other major transactions; and\n\u25a0\nThis concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or prevent a change in control and otherwise prevent shareholders other than our affiliates from influencing our direction and future.\nIf one or more of these risks, or other risks, materializes, our business will be harmed, and it may be harmed materially.\nCultural, language and other differences between the U.S. and China may create inefficiencies in our management and operations.\nOur majority shareholder, and a majority of our directors, reside in China and several of our directors exclusively speak Chinese. As we ramp up our China-based operations, we may experience conflicts or misunderstandings within our management structure that are primarily or partially rooted in language and cultural differences, particularly differences in management and communication styles. Language and cultural differences may also affect strategy formation and create inefficient and limited communication among technical and management employees located in different countries. The occurrence of any of these events may harm our growth potential, increase costs and decrease operational efficiency.\nOur nLTO, battery materials and battery business is currently dependent upon several customers and potential customers, which presents various risks.\nOur nLTO materials and battery business is dependent upon several current or potential customers. In addition, many of these customers are, or are expected to be, development partners who are subsidizing the research and development of products for which they may be the sole, or one of several, potential purchasers. As a result of the several potential customers and partners, our existing or potential customers and partners may have significant leverage on pricing terms, exclusivity terms and other economic and noneconomic terms. This may harm our attempts to sell products at prices that reflect desired gross margins. In addition, the decision by a single or potential customer to choose not to purchase or abandon the use or development of a product may significantly harm both our financial results and the development track of one or more products.\nWe depend upon several sole-source and limited-source third-party suppliers.\nWe rely on certain suppliers as the sole-source, or as a primary source, of certain services, raw materials and other components of our products. We do not yet have long-term supply or service agreements engaged with any such suppliers. As a result, the providers of such services and components could terminate or alter the terms of service or supply with little or no advance notice. If our arrangements with any sole-source supplier were terminated, or if such a supplier failed to provide essential services or deliver essential components on a timely basis, failed to meet our product specifications and/or quality standards, or introduced unacceptable price increases, our production schedule would be delayed, possibly by as long as one year. Any such delay in our production schedule would result in delayed product delivery and may also result in additional production costs, customer losses and litigation.\nAn area in which our dependence upon a limited number of sources creates significant vulnerability is the manufacturing of our nLTO cells. As of the date hereof, we have one contract manufacturing source for our nLTO cells, and we are currently working with a second manufacturer to qualify their cells. We have had quality issues with some of our past contract manufacturers. Our nLTO battery cells are the building blocks of all of our products (other than our nLTO powder). If we were to experience quality issues with any of our suppliers, we may be unable to meet our deadlines, or quality specifications, with respect to existing or future orders. This would harm our reputation and our ability to grow our business.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we believe that they will continue to fluctuate in the future, due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. If in future periods our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or analysts who choose to follow our company, the price of our shares of common stock may fall. Factors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u25a0\nfluctuations in the size, quantity and timing of customer orders;\n\u25a0\ntiming of delivery of our services and products;\n\u25a0\nadditions of new customers or losses of existing customers;\n\u25a0\npositive or negative business or financial developments announced by us or our key customers;\n\u25a0\nour ability to commercialize and obtain orders for products we are developing;\n\u25a0\ncosts associated with developing our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25a0\nthe loss of our key employees;\n\u25a0\nnew product announcements or introductions by our competitors or potential competitors;\n\u25a0\nthe effect of variations in the market price of our shares of common stock on our equity-based compensation expenses;\n\u25a0\ndisruptions in the supply of raw materials or components used in the manufacture of our products;\n\u25a0\nthe pace of adoption of regulation facilitating our ability to sell our products in our target markets;\n\u25a0\ntechnology and intellectual property issues associated with our products;\n\u25a0\ngeneral political, social, geopolitical and economic trends and events; and\n\u25a0\navailability of components sourced from Korea if tensions between North Korea and South Korea erupt into a greater military conflict.\nOur patents and other protective measures may not adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property.\nWe regard our intellectual property, particularly our proprietary rights in our nLTO technology, as critical to our success. We have received various patents, and filed other patent applications, for various applications and aspects of our nLTO technology and other intellectual property. Such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u25a0\nOur pending patent applications may not be granted for various reasons, including the existence of conflicting patents or defects in our applications, the existence of relevant prior art or the determination by an examiner that an invention was obvious to a person skilled in the art, whether or not there were other existing patents. Risks associated with patent applications are enhanced because patent applications of others remain confidential for a period of approximately 18 months after filing; as a result, our belief that we are the first creator of an invention or the first to patent it may prove incorrect, as information related to conflicting patents is first published or first brought to our attention;\n\u25a0\nThe patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual property rights or for other reasons;\n\u25a0\nThe patents we have been granted have a limited life span, and many will expire in the coming years and offer no legal protection to the technologies and processes described therein;\n\u25a0\nThe costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement cost prohibitive;\n\u25a0\nWe have not filed for patent protection in many countries in which we are currently selling product or seek to sell product; as a result, we may be unable to prevent competitors in such markets from selling infringing products;\n\u25a0\nEven if we enforce our rights aggressively, injunctions, fines and other penalties may be insufficient to deter violations of our intellectual property rights;\n\u25a0\nMany of our key patents begin expiring in 2020; we may be unable to protect key proprietary rights after the expiration of key patents; and\n\u25a0\nOther persons may independently develop proprietary information and techniques that, although functionally equivalent or superior to our intellectual proprietary information and techniques, do not breach proprietary rights.\nOur inability to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights or gain a competitive advantage from such rights could harm our ability to generate revenues and, as a result, our business and operations.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and involve adverse publicity and adverse results.\nCompetitors or others may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Interference proceedings brought by the United States Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, during the course of this litigation (even if ultimately successful), there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our shares of common stock.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover that technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nWe may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved. Even if we do prevail, these proceedings can be expensive, result in adverse publicity and distract our management.\nOther parties may bring intellectual property infringement claims against us, which would be time-consuming and expensive to defend, and if any of our products or processes is found to be infringing, we may not be able to procure licenses to use patents necessary to our business at reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties\u2019 patents and proprietary rights. We may inadvertently infringe existing third-party patents or third-party patents issued on existing patent applications. Third party holders of such patents or patent applications could bring claims against us that, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if resolved against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Under some circumstances in the United States, these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs.\nIf we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture, use or market infringing products, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder. In addition, we have, and may be required to, make representations as to our right to supply and/or license intellectual property and to our compliance with laws. Such representations are usually supported by indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our customers and otherwise make them whole if we license or supply products that infringe on third party technologies or violate government regulations. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we and our customers, development partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.\nAny successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action. Furthermore, we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal, nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder. As a result, any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position, be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, in particular with respect to a company controlled by a potential customer and competitor. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. Parties to the confidentiality agreements may have such agreements declared unenforceable or, even if the agreements are enforceable, may breach such agreements. Remedies available in connection with the breach of such agreements may not be adequate, or enforcing such agreement may be cost prohibitive. Courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets or independently develop processes or products that are similar or identical to our trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection would harm our competitive business position.\nIf we are sued on a product liability claim, our insurance policies may not be sufficient.\nOur insurance may not cover all potential types of product liability claims to which manufacturers are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business, including our relationships with current customers and our ability to attract and retain new customers. In addition, if the liability were substantial relative to the size of our business, any uncovered liability could harm our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern.\nLaws regulating the manufacture or transportation of batteries have been and may be enacted which could impose additional costs that could harm our ability to be profitable.\nInternational, federal, state and local laws regulate the storage, use and disposal of the component parts of our batteries in limited ways. However, laws and regulations may be enacted in the future which could impose environmental, health and safety controls on the storage, use and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium and lithium-ion batteries. Satisfying any future laws or regulations could require significant time and resources from our technical staff, including those related to possible redesign which may result in substantial expenditures and delays in the production of our product, all of which could harm our business and reduce our future profitability.\nThe transportation of lithium and lithium-ion batteries is regulated both domestically and internationally. Under recommendations adopted by the International Air Transport Association (\u201cIATA\u201d), our batteries and battery systems currently fall within the level such that they are not exempt and require a Class 9 designation for transportation. Future U.S, Chinese, international or IATA approval process and regulations could require significant time and resources from out technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could delay the introduction of new products.\nIf our warranty expense estimates differ materially from our actual claims, or if we are unable to estimate future warranty expense for new products, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nOur warranty for our products ranges from one to three years from the date of sale, depending on the type of product and its application. We expect that in the future some of our warranties may extend for longer periods. Because our supply arrangements are negotiated, the scope of our product warranties differ substantially depending upon the product, the purchaser and the intended use; however, we have granted and may grant broad warranties, addressing such issues as leakage, cycle life and decline in power. We have a limited product history on which to base our warranty estimates. Because of the limited operating history of our batteries and battery systems, our management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including anticipated rate of warranty claims, the durability and reliability of our products, and service delivery costs. Our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our batteries and battery systems, which could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products in the future and may exceed expected levels against which we have reserved. If our estimates prove incorrect, we could be required to accrue additional expenses from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time our customers make a warranty claim, which could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, with our new products and products that remain under development, we will be required to base our warranty estimates on historical experience of similar products, testing of our batteries under laboratory conditions and limited performance information learned during our development activities with the customer. As a result, actual warranty claims may be significantly different from our estimates and our financial results could vary significantly from period-to-period.\nProduct liability or other claims could cause us to incur losses or damage our reputation.\nThe risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the development, manufacturing and sale of batteries and battery systems. Certain materials we use in our batteries, as well as our battery systems, could, if used improperly, cause injuries to others. Improperly charging or discharging our batteries could cause fires, as could a puncture, collision or other event. Any accident involving our batteries or other products could decrease or even eliminate demand for our products. Because some of our batteries are designed to be used in electric and hybrid EV Buses, and because vehicle accidents can cause injury to persons and damage to property, we are subject to a risk of claims for such injuries and damages. In addition, we could be harmed by adverse publicity resulting from problems or accidents caused by third party products that incorporate our batteries. We could even be harmed by problems or accidents involving competing battery systems if the market viewed our batteries as being vulnerable to similar problems. Any such claims, loss of customers or reputation harm would harm our financial results and ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe commercialization of many of our products is dependent upon the efforts of commercial partners and other third parties over which we have no or little control.\nThe commercialization of our principal products requires the cooperation and efforts of commercial partners and customers. For example, because completion and testing of our large-scale stationary batteries for power suppliers requires input from utilities and connection to a power network, commercialization of such batteries can only be done in conjunction with a power or utility company. The commercialization of transportation and other applications of our technology are also dependent, in part, upon the expertise, resources and efforts of our commercial partners. This presents certain risks, including the following:\n\u25a0\nwe may not be able to enter into development, licensing, supply and other agreements with commercial partners with appropriate resources, technology and expertise on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u25a0\nour commercial partners may not place the same priority on a project as we do, may fail to honor contractual commitments, may not have the level of resources, expertise, market strength or other characteristics necessary for the success of the project, may dedicate only limited resources to, and/or may abandon, a development project for reasons, including reasons such as a shift in corporate focus, unrelated to its merits;\n\u25a0\nour commercial partners may be in the early stages of development and may not have sufficient liquidity to invest in joint development projects, expand their businesses and purchase our products as expected or honor contractual commitments;\n\u25a0\nour commercial partners may terminate joint testing, development or marketing projects on the merits of the projects for various reasons, including determinations that a project is not feasible, cost-effective or likely to lead to a marketable end product;\n\u25a0\nour commercial partners may not protect our intellectual property adequately or they may infringe our intellectual property rights;\n\u25a0\nat various stages in the testing, development, marketing or production process, we may have disputes with our commercial partners, which may inhibit development, lead to an abandonment of the project or have other negative consequences; and\n\u25a0\neven if the commercialization and marketing of jointly developed products is successful, our revenue share may be limited and may not exceed our associated development and operating costs.\nAs a result of the actions or omissions of our commercial partners, or our inability to identify and enter into suitable arrangements with qualified commercial partners, we may be unable to commercialize apparently viable products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all.\nInterest in our nLTO batteries is affected by energy supply and pricing, political events, popular consciousness and other factors over which we have no control.\nCurrently, our marketing and development efforts for our batteries and battery materials are focused primarily on stationary power and transportation applications. In the transportation market, batteries containing our nLTO materials are designed to replace or supplement gasoline and diesel engines. In the stationary power applications, our batteries are designed to conserve and regulate the stable supply of electricity, including from renewable source, and to displace coal, gas and diesel generators used in frequency regulation. The interest of our potential customers and business partners in our products and services is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u25a0\neconomic conditions and capital financing and liquidity constraints;\n\u25a0\nshort-term and long-term trends in the supply and price of natural gas, gasoline, diesel, coal and other fuels;\n\u25a0\nthe anticipated or actual granting or elimination by governments of tax and other financial incentives favoring electric or hybrid electric vehicles and renewable energy production;\n\u25a0\nthe ability of the various regulatory bodies to define the rules and procedures under which this new technology can be deployed into the electric grid;\n\u25a0\nthe anticipated or actual funding, or elimination of funding, for programs that support renewable energy programs and electric grid improvements;\n\u25a0\nchanges in public and investor interest for financial and/or environmental reasons, in supporting or adopting alternatives to gasoline and diesel for transportation and other purposes;\n\u25a0\nthe overall economic environment and the availability of credit to assist customers in purchasing our large battery systems;\n\u25a0\nthe expansion or contraction of private and public research and development budgets as a result of global and U.S. economic trends; and\n\u25a0\nthe speed of incorporation of renewable energy generating sources into the electric grid.\nAdverse trends in one or more of these factors may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and expand revenues from our battery materials and batteries.\nOur competitors may have more resources than we do, and may be supported by more prominent partners, which may give them a competitive advantage.\nWe have limited financial, personnel and other resources and, because of our early stage of development, have limited access to capital. We compete or may compete against entities that are much larger than we are, have more extensive resources than we do and have an established reputation and operating history. In addition, certain of our competitors may be partnered with, associated with or supported by larger business or financial partners. This may increase their ability to raise capital, attract media attention, develop products and attract customers. Because of their size, resources, reputation and history (or that of their business and financial partners), certain of our competitors may be able to exploit acquisition, development and joint venture opportunities more rapidly, easily or thoroughly than we can. In addition, potential customers may choose to do business with our more established competitors, without regard to the comparative quality of our products, because of their perception that our competitors are more stable, are more likely to complete various projects, are more likely to continue as a going concern and lend greater credibility to any joint venture.\nAs manufacturing becomes a larger part of our operations, we will become exposed to accompanying risks and liabilities.\nIn-house and outsourced manufacturing is becoming an increasingly significant part of our business. As a result, we expect to become increasingly subject to various risks associated with the manufacturing and supply of products, including the following:\n\u25a0\nIf we fail to supply products in accordance with contractual terms, including terms related to time of delivery and performance specifications, we may be required to repair or replace defective products and may become liable for direct, special, consequential and other damages, even if manufacturing or delivery was outsourced;\n\u25a0\nRaw materials used in the manufacturing process, labor and other key inputs may become scarce and expensive, causing our costs to exceed cost projections and associated revenues;\n\u25a0\nManufacturing processes typically involve large machinery, fuels and chemicals, any or all of which may lead to accidents involving bodily harm, destruction of facilities and environmental contamination and associated liabilities;\n\u25a0\nAs our manufacturing operations expand, we expect that a significant portion of our manufacturing will be done overseas, either by third-party contractors or in a plant owned by the Company. Any manufacturing done overseas presents risks associated with quality control, currency exchange rates, foreign laws and customs, timing and loss risks associated with overseas transportation and potential adverse changes in the political, legal and social environment in the host county; and\n\u25a0\nWe have made, and may be required to make, representations as to our right to supply and/or license intellectual property and to our compliance with laws. Such representations are usually supported by indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our customers and otherwise make them whole if we license or supply products that infringe on third-party technologies or violate government regulations.\nAny failure to adequately manage risks associated with the manufacture and supply of materials and products could lead to losses (or smaller than anticipated gross profits) from that segment of our business and/or significant liabilities, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur past and future operations may lead to substantial environmental liability.\nVirtually any prior or future production of our nanomaterials and titanium dioxide pigment technology is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. Under such laws, we may be jointly and severally liable with prior property owners for the treatment, cleanup, remediation and/or removal of any hazardous substances discovered at any property we use. In addition, courts or government agencies may impose liability for, among other things, the improper release, discharge, storage, use, disposal or transportation of hazardous substances. If we incur any significant environmental liabilities, our ability to execute our business plan and our financial condition would be harmed.\nCertain of our experts and directors reside in China and may be able to avoid civil liability.\nA majority of our directors reside outside the United States, primarily in China. As a result, investors may be unable to effect service of process upon such persons within the United States and may be unable to enforce court judgments against such persons predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is uncertain whether Chinese courts would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such directors, officers or experts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws or impose liability in original actions against us or our directors, officers or experts predicated upon U.S. securities laws.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur continued success will depend, to a significant extent, on the services of our executive management team and certain key scientists and engineers. We do not have key man insurance on any of these individuals. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, turnover in key positions, which could result in the loss of company-specific knowledge, experience and expertise. The loss or unavailability of any or all of these individuals could harm our ability to execute our business plan, maintain important business relationships and complete certain product development initiatives, which would harm our business.\nWe will not be able to issue any substantial amounts of additional shares.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 200 million shares of common stock that may be issued without any action or approval by our stockholders. In addition, we have various stock option plans that have potential for diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of our company held by existing stockholders.\nWe have never declared a cash dividend and do not intend to declare a cash dividend in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our shares of common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings, if any, for use in our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 84596, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ALTI"}
