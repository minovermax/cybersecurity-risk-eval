RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and investments in us. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the discussion of other factors that could affect us or investments in us included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These known material risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business\nOur business and financial performance depends on well completion activity in the oil and natural gas industry.\nDemand for frac sand is materially dependent on the levels of activity in oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and more specifically, the number of oil and natural gas wells completed in geological formations where proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing treatments and the amount of frac sand customarily used in the completion of such wells.\nIndustry conditions that impact the activity levels of oil and natural gas producers are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nfuture economic returns and the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of alternative energy sources; and\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.\nA prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and well completion activity, which could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and deliver. In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are developed, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and production activity or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. If there is a decrease in the demand for frac sand, we may be unable to sell or deliver volumes, or be forced to reduce our sales prices, any of which would reduce the amount of cash we generate.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to risks normally encountered in the oil field services and commercial silica industries, some of which are beyond our control including the following:\n\u2022\nthe pace of adoption of our integrated logistics solutions;\n\u2022\ndemand and pricing for our integrated logistics solutions;\n\u2022\nthe volume of frac sand we are able to buy and sell;\n\u2022\nthe price at which we are able to buy and sell frac sand;\n\u2022\nthe amount of frac sand we are able to timely deliver at the wellsite, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, logistics constraints, weather, or other delays at the wellsite or transloading facility;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing economic conditions, including the extent of changes in crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe amount of frac sand we are able to excavate and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties, cave-ins, pit wall failures, rock falls and unusual or unfavorable geologic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary equipment or replacement parts;\n\u2022\nchanges in railroad infrastructure, price, capacity and availability, including the potential for rail line disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in road infrastructure, including the potential for trucking and other transportation disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of transportation;\n\u2022\nextensive regulation of trucking services;\n\u2022\nchanges in, and volatility of, fuel prices;\n\u2022\navailability of or failure of our contractors, partners and service providers to provide services at the agreed-upon levels or times;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain safe work sites at our facilities or by third parties at their work sites;\n\u2022\ninclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as leaks and spills as well as unauthorized discharges of fluids or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nindustrial and transportation related accidents;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\ndifficulty collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ninability of our customers to take delivery;\n\u2022\nchanges in the product specifications requested by customers and the regional destinations for such product;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining, maintaining and renewing permits, including environmental permits or other licenses and approvals such as mining or water rights;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns or restrictions in operations in response to environmental regulatory actions including but not limited to actions related to endangered species;\n\u2022\nsystemic design or engineering flaws in the equipment we use to produce product and provide logistics services;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (or the interpretation or enforcement thereof) related to the mining and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation, claims or assessments, including unasserted claims;\n\u2022\nchallenges to or infringement upon our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and disputes with our third-party contractors;\n\u2022\ninability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ncyber security breaches of our systems and information technology;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the foreign currency exchange rates in the countries that we conduct business;\n\u2022\nchanges in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the political environment of the geographical areas in which we and our customers operate.\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in the demand for logistics and wellsite services, as well as the supply of frac sand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by a small number of large, national companies and a larger number of small, regional or local companies in the production, distribution and logistics of frac sand. Competition in the industry is based on price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics.\nWe compete with large, national companies such as U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Covia Holdings Corporation, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. and others. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production and distribution facilities or last mile delivery solutions that are significantly advantaged over ours. Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as competitors may sell frac sand at below market prices. In addition, E&Ps and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could compete directly with us, which may negatively impact pricing and demand for our frac sand and related services. Because the markets for our products and logistics services are typically local, we also compete with smaller regional or local companies. If demand for hydraulic fracturing services decreases and the supply of frac sand available in the market increases, prices in the frac sand market could continue to materially decrease. Furthermore, our competitors may choose to consolidate, which could provide them with greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face distribution and logistics challenges in our business.\nAs oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, our customers may shift their focus back and forth between different resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Transportation and logistics operating expenses comprise a significant portion of our total delivered cost of sales. Therefore, serving our customers in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that may affect our sales and negatively impact our operating costs. Disruptions in transportation services, including shortages of railcars or trucks, or a lack of developed infrastructure, could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to competitors located in closer proximity to our customers. Additionally, increases in the price of transportation costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, terminal switch fees and demurrage costs, excess railcars or trucking rates could negatively impact operating costs if we are unable to pass those increased costs along to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistics challenges could adversely affect our ability to respond quickly to the needs of our customers or result in additional increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe majority of our sales are generated under contracts with companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The loss of a contract or customer, a significant reduction in purchases by any customer, our customers' failure to comply with contract terms, or our inability to renegotiate, renew or replace our existing contracts on favorable terms could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we have contracted to sell raw frac sand under long-term supply agreements to customers with remaining terms ranging from 3 to 60 months. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 72% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in a MSA and related work orders.\nSome of our customers have exited or could exit the business, or have been or could be acquired by other companies that purchase frac sand or logistics services we provide from other third-party providers. Our current customers also may seek to acquire frac sand or logistics services from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or capture and develop their own sources of frac sand or logistics services. The loss of a customer or contract, or a reduction in the amount of frac sand or logistics services purchased by any customer, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may fail to comply with the terms of their existing contracts. Our enforcement of specific contract terms may be limited by market dynamics and other factors. A customer's failure to comply with contract terms or our limited enforcement thereof could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUpon the expiration of our current contracts, our customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of frac sand or logistics services due to a variety of reasons. In addition, we may choose to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms or at reduced volumes in order to preserve relationships with our customers. Upon the expiration of our current contract terms, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation of our contracts on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term contracts may preclude us from mitigating the effect of increased operational costs during the term of our long-term contracts, even though certain volumes under certain of our long-term contracts are subject to annual fixed price escalators or other pricing adjustment mechanisms.\nThe pricing arrangements under our long-term supply contracts we have may negatively impact our results of operations. If our operational costs increase during the terms of our long-term supply contracts, we may not be able to pass any of those increased costs to our customers. If we are unable to otherwise mitigate these increased operational costs, our net income could decline. Additionally, in periods with increasing prices, our sales may not keep pace with market prices.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, whose operations are concentrated in a single industry, the global oil and natural gas industry. In particular, as a result of volatility in oil and natural gas prices and ongoing uncertainty in the global economic environment our customers may not be able to fulfill their existing commitments or access financing necessary to fund their current or future obligations. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise sell the volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have outstanding Senior Notes and have entered into an ABL Credit Facility, which contain restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility place financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business, which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility restrict, and any other future financing agreements that we may enter into could restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Additionally, our Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on property;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into a merger, consolidate or acquire capital in or assets of other entities;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance acquisitions, equipment purchases and development expenditures, or withstand a future downturn in our business.\nOur ability to comply with any such restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these restrictions or covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions or covenants in the Senior Notes or ABL Credit Facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to repay amounts borrowed, the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral. In addition, our obligations under our ABL Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness as required under the ABL Credit Facility, or under our Senior Notes, the lenders to our ABL Credit Facility could seek to foreclose on these assets.\nOur long-term Senior Notes debt is currently rated by Moody's Investors Service Inc. (\"Moody's\") and Standard and Poor\u2019s (\"S&P\"). As of February 14, 2020, the credit rating of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes was Caa1 from Moody\u2019s and CCC+ from S&P. Any future downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively impact the cost of raising capital, and a downgrade could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy and to access capital in the public markets.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to increases in interest rates under our ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility. To the extent there are any outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, changes in applicable interest rates would not affect the ABL Credit Facility\u2019s fair market value, but could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the ABL Credit Facility uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. LIBOR may disappear entirely or may perform differently than in the past. The consequences with respect to LIBOR cannot be predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable interest rate under the ABL Credit Facility.\nWe may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, develop and increase our asset base. The inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nAlthough we have used a significant amount of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to fund the development and expansion of our asset base, we may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the restrictions and covenants contained in our Senior Notes, ABL Credit Facility or other future debt agreements, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds necessary to maintain, develop and increase our asset base could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. In addition, the issuance of additional equity interests may result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur expansion or modification of existing assets, or the construction of new assets, may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction of new facilities, additions or modifications to our existing facilities, or equipment may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, upon the expenditure of future funds on a particular project, our revenues may not increase immediately, or as anticipated, or at all. For instance, we may construct new facilities or equipment over an extended period of time and will not receive any material increases in revenues until the projects are completed. Moreover, we may expend capital to capture anticipated future growth in a location in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the hydraulic fracturing process, we may be unable to accurately predict the extent of well completion activity to take place in future periods. To the extent we rely on estimates of future levels of well completion activity in any decision to construct facilities or equipment, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in forecasting levels of well completion activity. In addition, our assets may be subject to numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties which could negatively impact our ability to capture anticipated economic benefits. Our expansion or modification of existing or new assets may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreased demand for raw frac sand due to the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.\nRaw frac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Raw frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than other proppants, such as resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramics. A significant shift in demand from frac sand, including from the types of raw frac sand product that we produce and sell to other proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny adverse developments at our production facilities or which impact our logistics and wellsite operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny adverse development at our production facilities or which impact our logistics and wellsite operations, due to catastrophic events, weather or any other event that would cause us to curtail, suspend or terminate operations, could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries or other service commitments to our customers. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes within the required time frame we could be required to pay make-whole payments to our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to provide supply from our production facilities or unable to fulfill logistics service commitments there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInaccuracies in estimates of volumes and qualities of our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected production costs.\nJohn T. Boyd Company (\"John T. Boyd\"), our independent reserve engineers, prepared estimates of our reserves based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists. However, frac sand reserve estimates are by nature imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable frac sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of frac sand, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nAny inaccuracy in John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates related to our frac sand reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs. For example, John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of our proven reserves assume that our revenue and cost structure will remain relatively constant over the life of our reserves. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some or all of our reserves may not be economically mineable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we pay a fixed price per ton of sand excavated regardless of the quality of the frac sand, and our current customer contracts require us to deliver frac sand that meets certain specifications. If John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of the quality of our reserves, including the volumes of the various specifications of those reserves, prove to be inaccurate, we may incur significantly higher excavation costs without corresponding increases in revenues, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligations, or our facilities may have a shorter than expected reserve life, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having received or renewed the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold and will seek numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations. For our extraction and processing, the permitting process is subject to federal, state and local authority. For example, on the federal level, a Mine Identification Request (MSHA Form 7000-51) must be filed and obtained before mining commences. If wetlands are implicated, a Corps Wetland Permit is required. At the state level, a series of permits and approvals are required related to air quality, wetlands, water quality (waste water, stormwater), grading permits, endangered species, archaeological assessments, and high capacity wells in addition to others depending upon site-specific factors and operational detail. At the local level, zoning, building, stormwater, erosion control, wellhead protection, road usage and access, among other matters may be regulated and require permitting or approval to some degree. Additionally a non-metallic mining reclamation permit is required for our Wisconsin production facilities while an Aggregate Production Operations permit is required for our Texas production facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commence or continue related operations.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. Legal challenges successfully claiming that we do not have title to our property or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop, and extract minerals, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event we have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. Such third party could take legal action to restrict or suspend the access or easement or could refuse to renew such rights of access or easements upon their contractual expiration, and any such action could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nLaws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business and result in additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations in completion of new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for our frac sand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. Hydraulic fracturing is currently generally exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\") Underground Injection Control (\"UIC\") program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing continues to be controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation of the fracturing process, including by federal agencies that have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities as well as published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing under the federal Toxic Substance Control Act. Additionally, the EPA has published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The federal Bureau of Land Management published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but the bureau rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the bureau\u2019s decision to rescind the 2015 rule remains pending in federal district court. Also, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.\nFrom time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but no comprehensive hydraulic fracturing legislation at the federal level has been implemented to date. However, concern over the threat of climate change has resulted in the making of pledges by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020 to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters.\nIn addition, some state and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including states where we or our customers operate. For example, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Also, in April 2019, the Governor of Colorado signed Senate Bill 19-181 into law, which legislation, among other things, revises the mission of the state oil and gas agency from fostering energy development in the state to instead focusing on regulating the oil and natural gas industry in a manner that is protective of public health and safety and the environment, as well as authorizing cities and counties to regulate oil and natural gas operations within their jurisdiction as they do other developments. Among other things, the Colorado oil and gas agency will consider enhanced safety and environmental protections during well development operations, including drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. States could also elect to place certain prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing, following the approach taken by the States of Maryland, New York and Vermont. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances to regulate or severely restrict the time, place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions. Moreover, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing. For example, notwithstanding the adoption of Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 in 2019, one or more interest groups in Colorado have already filed new ballot initiatives with the state in January 2020, in hopes of extending drilling setbacks from oil and gas development.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. The adoption of new or more stringent laws or regulations at the federal, state and local levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic oil and natural gas fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand. Also, presidential executive orders could be issued seeking to further restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing activities or new leases for production of minerals on federal properties and heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our frac sand, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA facility closure or long-term idling entails substantial costs, and if we close our production facilities sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn September 2018, the Company temporarily idled dry plant operations at the Whitehall facility and resumed production in January 2019. Beginning in August 2019, the Company reduced the hours of operations at the Whitehall facility. In January 2019, the Augusta facility was idled.\nThe closure or long-term idling of a production facility could involve significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, non-saleable sand, ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our production facilities on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions may not prove to be accurate. If we were to reduce the estimated life of our production facilities, the fixed facility closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nApplicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, minimizing or preventing erosion and limiting the potential for sediment run-off into surface waters other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining land use. We are required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with facility closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGiven the nature of our frac sand mining and processing operations, we face a material risk of liability, delays and increased cash costs of production from environmental and industrial accidents as well as due to operational breakdowns.\nOur business involves significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents and breakdowns of equipment and machinery. Our business is exposed to hazards associated with frac sand mining, processing and the related storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns, the relevant facility may not be fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. The occurrence of any of these or other hazards could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular facility or on our business as a whole. Incidents of this nature have occurred in the past and may happen again in the future. We have insurance policies for industrial, environmental and other accidents, but such policies are limited by their terms and may not cover certain risks in their entirety or at all.\nOur production process consumes large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of these or any other energy sources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, represented 2% of our total sales and 12% of our total production costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying in the frac sand production process and, as such, our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. Because we have not contracted for the provision of natural gas on a fixed-price basis, our costs and profitability will be impacted by fluctuations in prices for natural gas. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. The price of natural gas has been extremely volatile over the last several years. In order to manage this risk, we may hedge natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as forwards, swaps and futures. However, these measures carry risk (including nonperformance by counterparties) and do not in any event entirely eliminate the risk of decreased margins as a result of natural gas price increases. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through hedging arrangements or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nSeasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by seasonal and severe weather conditions. Severe weather conditions may affect our customers\u2019 operations, thus reducing their need for our products or ability to take delivery of our product at the terminal or the wellsite, or impact our operations by resulting in weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment and impact our customers\u2019 ability to take delivery of our products at our plant site. For example, severe winter weather conditions impact our Wisconsin operations by causing us to halt our excavation and wet-plant-related production activities during the winter months. During non-winter months, we excavate and process excess sand to build a sufficient washed sand stockpile that feeds the dry plant. Unexpected winter conditions (e.g., if winter conditions come earlier than expected or last longer than expected) may result in us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months, which could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nAdditionally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Any weather-related interference with our operations could force us to delay or curtail services and potentially breach our contractual obligations to deliver minimum volumes or result in a loss of productivity and an increase in our operating costs.\nOur cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.\nOur cash flow is affected by a variety of factors, including weather conditions and seasonal periods. Seasonal fluctuations in weather impact the production levels at our wet processing plant and the level of completion activity in-basin. While our sales and finished product production levels are contracted annually and expected to be fulfilled evenly throughout the year, varying levels of wet plant production and in-basin demand can lead to cash flows fluctuating through the year. For example, our mining and wet sand processing activities at our Wisconsin facilities are limited to non-winter months and while the wet processing plant is not operating, we will perform annual maintenance activities, the majority of which are expensed. As a consequence of the seasonality we may experience lower cash costs and higher expense in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year.\nDiminished access to water may adversely affect our operations.\nThe excavation and processing activities in which we engage require significant amounts of water, of which we seek to recycle a significant percentage in our operating process. As a result, securing water rights and water access to sufficient volumes of water is necessary for the operation of our processing facilities. If future excavation and processing activities are located in an area that is water-constrained, there may be additional costs associated with securing sufficient water access. We have obtained water rights that we currently use to service the activities on our properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, one or more water discharge permits may be required to properly dispose of water, including wastewater and stormwater at our processing sites. The water discharge permitting process is also subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability or delay in obtaining the necessary permits could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our facilities and operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe performance and quality of our products and logistics services are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems or adherence to our training in implementing such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or unable to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire, our future growth could be limited.\nA portion of our strategy to grow our business is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions. If we are unable to make acquisitions because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements, we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or we are outbid by competitors, our future growth may be limited. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\ninability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees have extensive experience and expertise in the frac sand and logistics services business, as well as substantial experience and relationships with participants in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.\nA shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient sand production and delivery requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in multiple tasks. Our operations also utilize third-party contractors. There may be a shortage of skilled labor required throughout our operations in various locations. If the shortage of experienced skilled labor continues or worsens, we may find it difficult to retain or replace third-party contractors, and we may be unable to retain, attract and hire or train the necessary number of skilled laborers to perform our own operations. In either event, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to conduct operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminal facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminals are located and instead own leasehold interests and rights-of-way for the operation of these facilities. Upon expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leasehold terms, we may be unable to renew our existing leases or rights-of-way on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation on less favorable terms or inability to enter into new leases on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leases or rights-of-way could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption of transportation services or fluctuations in transportation costs could reduce revenues by impeding our ability to deliver product or services to our customers.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total delivered cost of frac sand for our customers and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Disruption of transportation services due to shortages of rail cars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply our customers through our logistics network of rail-based terminals or our last mile operations or, if our customers are not using our transportation services, the ability of our customers to take delivery of frac sand. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the rail transportation or trucking services utilized by ourselves or our customers, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur logistics and wellsite operations are subject to motor vehicle-related risks.\nOur logistics and wellsite operations rely on third-party trucking services. Trucking services can be adversely impacted by traffic congestion and weather delays which could hinder our service levels. Motor vehicle accidents could also impact our service levels, as well as lead to materially adverse litigation claims and unfavorable publicity. The trucking industry can face challenges in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, which could impact our service levels. Additionally, changes to vehicle engine emissions regulations and insurance rates could impose substantial costs on us. Accordingly, these motor vehicle-related risks could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDiesel fuel costs and rail fuel surcharges generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor trailers, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. We contract with a third party to excavate raw frac sand, deliver the raw frac sand to our processing facility and move the sand from our wet plant to our dry plant, and pay a fixed price per ton of sand delivered to our wet plant, subject to a fuel surcharge based on the price of diesel fuel. Rail transportation and trucking rates are generally subject to varying fuel surcharges based on the price of diesel fuel. Accordingly, increased diesel fuel costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including blizzards, tornadoes, storms, floods and earthquakes. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our operations.\nWe believe we carry adequate insurance, but we may not be fully insured against all risks incident to our business, including the risk of our operations being interrupted due to severe weather and natural disasters. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase. In addition, sub-limits have been imposed for certain risks. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn epidemic or public health crisis could disrupt our operations.\nAn epidemic or public health crisis could disrupt our operations in several ways. A widespread disease outbreak could reduce the demand for oil and gas, thus reducing demand for frac sand. Additionally, a public health crisis could impede the ability of our workforce to conduct operations. Moreover, a health crisis could hinder our supply chain and logistics operations.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payers or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Additionally, destructive forms of protest and opposition by extremists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism, against oil and natural gas development and production activities could potentially result in damage or injury to persons, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our or our clients\u2019 operations. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our frac sand. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. The audit committee is responsible for cyber oversight.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future new or amended legal requirements, or more stringent interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing the mining and mineral processing industry, including among other things, those relating to health and safety aspects of our operations, environmental permitting and licensing, air emissions and water discharges, water pollution and soil and groundwater contamination, waste management, hazardous materials, land use, remediation, reclamation and restoration of properties, wildlife protection, and natural resources. These laws and regulations, and the permits implemented thereunder have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business. Environmental laws may impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and certain of these laws, such as CERCLA, may impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of releases of hazardous substances or property contamination, regardless of whether we or third parties were responsible for such release and even if our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred. Additionally, we may incur liability associated with releases of materials into the environment or for injuries to persons or damages to properties and natural resources, and such liability may potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial, modification, or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on our operations, including cessation of operations; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to perform site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nAny such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations, increase significantly our operating costs, or impose additional operating restrictions among our customers that reduce demand for our products and services.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent legal requirements that could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our mineral deposits or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, we or our customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures, which costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us. Examples of recent environmental regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (\"NAAQS\") for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. Since that time, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and issued final requirements that apply to state, local and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised standard could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers\u2019 equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers\u2019 capital expenditures and operating costs.\n\u2022\nFederal Jurisdiction over Waters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands. In 2017, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule made effective on December 23, 2019, rescinding the 2015 rule. On January 23, 2019, the two agencies issued a final rule re-defining such jurisdiction, which redefinition is narrower than found in the 2015 rule. Upon being published in the Federal Register and the passage of 60 days thereafter, the January 23, 2020 final rule will become effective, at which point the United States will be covered under a single regulatory scheme as it relates to federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. However, there remains the expectation that the January 23, 2020 final rule also will be legally challenged in federal district court. To the extent that any challenge to the January 23, 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, we or our customers could incur increased costs and delays or cancellations, which could reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe may not be able to comply with any new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, and any such new or amended laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or equipment or shut down our facilities. Additionally, our customers may not be able to comply with new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, which could cause our customers to curtail or cease their operations, which could significantly reduce the demand for our products and services. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, or any material adverse effect that any such standards will have on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.\nSilica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including MSHA and OSHA, may continue to propose and implement changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. For example, in 2016, OSHA published a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees, such as requirements for exposure assessments, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recording. Compliance with most aspects of the 2016 rule relating to hydraulic fracturing was required by June 2018, and the 2016 rule further requires compliance with engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica in connection with hydraulic fracturing activities by June 2021. While compliance with the requirements of the 2016 rule may result in significant operating costs or capital expenditures, we do not expect such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event and to the extent that additional legal requirements with respect to limiting human exposure to crystalline silica are adopted in the future, we may not be able to comply with such new legal requirements, and any such new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.\nIn addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is recent evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the frac sand industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of frac sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of our frac sand. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling frac sand could materially and adversely affect frac sand producers, including us, through reduced use of frac sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the frac sand industry.\nWe are subject to the MSH Act and the OSH Act, both of which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the MSH Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, as well as the OSH Act, including but not limited to the OSHA rule imposing more stringent requirements regarding respirable crystalline silica that was published in 2016 and most of which requirements became effective in June 2018. The MSH Act and the OSH Act impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations inclusive of mineral extraction and processing operations, transportation and transloading of silica and delivery of silica sand to wellsites. These standards include the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating and safety equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards or changes in such standards or the reinterpretation or more stringent enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including plant and wildlife protection and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory matters described above in other risk factors, we and our customers are subject to other extensive laws and regulations on matters such as plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration activities at mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining and hydraulic fracturing have on groundwater quality and availability. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity and quality of our frac sand deposits, our ability to extract these deposits profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.\nIn order to obtain permits and renewals of permits with respect to these other regulatory matters in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed excavation or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies, and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes hindered due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. Significant opposition to a permit by neighboring property owners, members of the public, or other third parties, or delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could delay or impair our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract or the pace of extraction of mineral deposits), our cost structure, or our customers\u2019 ability to use our frac sand. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.\nOur customers' operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, including regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks, which could result in increased operating and capital costs for our customers and reduced demand for the products and services we provide.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs, as well as to limit such future emissions. As a result, the operations of our customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, to date. However, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored \"Paris Agreement,\" which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Critical declarations made by one or more presidential candidates include proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions to oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities, as well as the rescission of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending and investment practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of any federal or state legislation or regulations or international agreements that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also materially and adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, which may reduce demand for our frac sand products and services. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our products and services. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan following the completion of mining activities at the property. We are required under federal, state, and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state, and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense, or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain, or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Structure\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nHolders of the common stock may not receive any dividends or may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under any dividend policy adopted by the board of directors.\nThe terms of any dividend policy that the board of directors may adopt are not currently determined, and any dividend policy adopted may be amended, revoked or suspended at any time. Even while any dividend policy is in place, the actual amount of dividends on the common stock will depend on many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, capital requirements, legal, regulatory and contractual constraints, tax laws and other factors.\nOver time, our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs, which could affect whether the board of directors declares any dividends and the amount of any dividends we may pay in the future. Our level of indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on the common stock under certain circumstances. A decline in the market price or liquidity, or both, of the common stock could result if the board of directors commits capital or establishes large reserves that reduce the amounts that could be paid as quarterly dividends paid or if the board of directors reduces or eliminates the payment of any dividends. This may in turn result in losses by holders of the common stock which could be substantial.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to stockholders. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nprovide advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder nominations of candidates for election as directors or other stockholder proposals to be brought before meetings of stockholders, which may preclude stockholders from bringing certain matters before stockholders at an annual or special meeting;\n\u2022\nprovide the board of directors the ability to authorize issuance of preferred stock in one or more series, which makes it possible for the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us and that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors or fill vacancies in respect of such directors as specified in the related preferred stock designation, all vacancies, including newly created directorships, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and will not be filled by stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that, subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock, if any, to remove directors elected by such series of preferred stock pursuant to the certificate of incorporation (including any preferred stock designation thereunder), prior to the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors (the \"Classified Board Expiration Time\"), directors may be removed from office at any time, only for cause and by the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding voting shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Upon the Classified Board Expiration Time and thereafter, any director, or the entire board of directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that the provisions of the certificate of incorporation can only be amended or repealed by (a) the Company in the manner then prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware or (b) the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of a least a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon; and\n\u2022\nprovide that our bylaws can be amended or repealed by (a) the board of directors or (b) the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nWe may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOn May 31, 2019, we converted from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation. From time to time, we may undertake other internal reorganizations in an effort to simplify our organizational structure, streamline our operations or for other operational reasons. Such internal reorganization may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries. These transactions could be disruptive to our business, result in significant expense, require regulatory approvals, and fail to result in the intended or expected benefits, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13544, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "HCRSQ"}
