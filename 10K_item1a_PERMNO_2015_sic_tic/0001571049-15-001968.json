Risk Factors\nIn evaluating our business, every investor should carefully consider the following risks. Our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks.\nThe Telecommunications Industry Has Experienced Increased Competition.\nAlthough we have historically experienced limited wireline telephone competition in many of our RLEC territories, the market for telecommunication services is highly competitive. Currently, we have competition in eight of our markets from cable providers and an electric co-operative. Certain competitors benefit from brand recognition and financial, personnel, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours, which may also be impacted by further industry consolidation. We cannot predict the number of competitors that will emerge, especially as a result of existing or new federal and state regulatory or legislative actions. Increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIn all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers. As wireless carriers continue to build-out their voice and data networks and add products and services targeted to the fixed wireless market, we may experience increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThe current and potential competitors in our RLEC territories include cable television companies; electric utilities; CLECs and other providers of telecommunications and data services, including internet and VoIP service providers; wireless carriers; satellite television companies; alternate access providers; neighboring incumbent local exchange carriers; and long distance companies that may provide services competitive with those services that we provide or intend to provide.\nIn Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, our CLEC operations may encounter a change in the competitive landscape that would impact its continued ability to grow and/or retain customers, sustain current pricing plans and control the cost of access to incumbent carrier customers.\nAlthough our long distance operations have historically been modest in relation to our competitors, we have expanded our long distance business within our territories, primarily through bundling long distance with other local services and providing a single bill for these services. Our existing long distance competitors, including those with significantly greater resources than us and carriers offering VoIP services, could respond with attractive new offerings. There can be no assurance that our local services revenue, including long distance services, will not decrease in the future as competition and/or the cost of providing services increase.\nWe Have a Significant Amount of Debt Maturing in April 2016.\nWe currently have $112.1 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility that matures in April 2016. We will be in default under our credit facility if we are unable to refinance the debt thereunder at or prior to its maturity. There can be no assurance that market conditions will allow us to refinance the debt under our credit facility at or prior to its maturity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nChanges in the Regulation of the Telecommunications Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue or Cash Flow.\nWe operate in an industry that is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The majority of our revenue has historically been supported by and subject to regulation. Certain federal and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, federal and state universal service funds (including USF HCL), the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. The FCC Order began significantly reducing access revenue received by us in July 2012 and, unless revised, will significantly reduce USF HCL revenue over a five to ten year period. In addition, the FCC Order imposes certain costs and rate increases on carriers that we may not be able to pass on to our customers without experiencing further access line loss.\nWe Are Subject to Restrictive Debt Covenants That Limit Our Business Flexibility By Imposing Operating and Financial Restrictions on Our Operations.\nOur credit facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, which may limit our ability to invest in new services or respond to competitive forces, including, without limitation, restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock and certain redeemable capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain types of restricted payments, including investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or repurchase our common stock;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nenter into specified transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate a number of liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business.\nAny of our future indebtedness may impose similar or other restrictive covenants.\nIn addition, our credit facility and our certificate of incorporation each contain a covenant generally requiring us to sell all of our equity interests or substantially all of our assets within 180 days after the occurrence of certain triggering events. Our credit facility also requires quarterly fixed principal payments and variable excess cash flow payments, which may limit cash available for our operations.\nWe May Not Be Able to Integrate New Technologies and Provide New Services in a Cost-Efficient Manner.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our capital expenditure requirements, our profitability or the industry in general. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming to install and integrate into our network. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate the revenue anticipated from such services.\nDisruptions in Our Networks and Infrastructure May Cause Us to Lose Customers and Incur Additional Expenses.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and timely service over our networks. We face the following risks to our networks and infrastructure:\n\u2022\nour territories could have significant weather events which physically damage access lines and network infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour rural geography creates the risk of security breaches, break-ins and sabotage;\n\u2022\nmuch of our equipment has long service lives, which could increase the frequency of malfunction and outage;\n\u2022\nour equipment, access and network interface suppliers could experience outages, delivery limitations or labor issues which could impact our ability to provide services to our customers;\n\u2022\npower surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking and software or hardware defects that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nunusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers\u2019 networks.\nDisruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. In addition, the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC, VPSB and/or WVPSC could require us to issue credits on customer bills for such service interruptions, further impacting revenue and cash flow.\nOur Operating Activities Are Subject to Risks Caused by Misappropriation, Misuse, Leakage, Falsification and Accidental Release or Loss of Information Maintained in Our Information Technology Systems.\nOur operating activities are subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification and accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data. We could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage the reputation and credibility of us and our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. We could also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.\nOur Business is Geographically Concentrated and Dependent on Regional Economic Conditions.\nOur business is conducted primarily in north central Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia and, accordingly, our business is dependent upon the general economic conditions of these regions. There can be no assurance that future economic conditions in these regions, including the slow recovery from the current global economic downturn, will not impact demand for our services or cause residents to relocate to other regions, which may adversely impact our business, revenue and cash flow.\nOur Success Depends on a Small Number of Key Personnel.\nOur success depends on the personal efforts of a small group of skilled employees and senior management. The rural nature of much of our service area provides for a smaller pool of skilled telephone employees and increases the challenge of hiring employees. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe Provide Numerous Services to Our Customers Over Access Lines, and if We Lose Access Lines, Our Business and Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected.\nOur business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services over access lines. We have experienced net voice access line loss in our RLEC territories due to increased competition, wireless substitution, challenging economic conditions and loss of second lines. RLEC residential voice access lines declined by approximately 9.7% during 2014. We expect to continue to experience net residential voice access line loss in our rural markets. It is unlikely that we will be able to offset the loss of residential voice lines by data access line growth which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur Performance Is Subject to a Number of Other Economic and Non-Economic Factors, Which We May Not Be Able to Predict Accurately.\nThere are factors that may be beyond our control that could affect our operations and business. Such factors include adverse changes in the conditions in the specific markets for our services, the conditions in the broader market for telecommunication services and the conditions in the domestic and global economies, generally.\nAlthough our performance is affected by the general condition of the economy, not all of our services are affected equally. Voice access revenue is generally linked to relatively consistent variables such as population changes, housing starts and general economic activity levels in the areas served. Data access and cable television revenue is generally related to more variable factors, such as changing levels of discretionary spending on entertainment and the adoption of e-commerce and other on-line activities by our current or prospective customers. It is not possible for management to accurately predict all of these factors and the impact of such factors on our performance.\nChanges in the competitive, technological and regulatory environments may also impact our ability to increase revenue and/or earnings from the provision of local wireline services. We may therefore have to place increased emphasis on developing and realizing revenue through the provision of new and enhanced services with higher growth potential. In such a case, there is a risk that these revenue sources, as well as our cost savings efforts through further efficiency gains, will not grow or develop at a fast enough pace to offset declines in local residential services. It is also possible that, as we invest in new technologies and services, demand for those new services may not develop. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our service offerings through the development of new services, and our efforts to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nGovernmental Authorities Could Decrease Network Access Charges or Rates for Local Services, Which Would Adversely Affect Our Revenue.\nApproximately 15.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was derived from interstate network access charges paid by long distance carriers for use of our facilities to originate and terminate interstate and intrastate telephone calls. The interstate network access rates that we can charge are regulated by the FCC. Intrastate network access rates, which formerly were regulated by the regulatory commissions in each state in which we operate, have been capped and reduced by the FCC. The FCC continues to reform the federal network access charge system with the stated intent to promote deployment of broadband data services. In October 2011, the FCC released the FCC Order, which has and will continue to significantly change the way telecommunication carriers receive compensation for exchanging traffic. On July 1, 2013, all terminating intrastate rates that exceeded the interstate rate were reduced to the interstate rate. In 2014, the interstate rate began a six year reduction to \u201cbill and keep,\u201d in which carriers bill their customers for services and keep those charges, but neither pay for nor receive compensation from traffic sent to or received from other carriers. It is unknown at this time what additional changes, if any, the FCC or state regulatory commissions may adopt. Such regulatory developments could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThe local services rates and intrastate access fees charged by our RLECs are regulated by state regulatory commissions which have the power to grant and revoke authorization to companies to provide telecommunication services and to impose other conditions and penalties. If we fail to comply with regulations set forth by the state regulatory commissions, we may face revocation of our authorizations in a state or other conditions and penalties. It is possible that new plans would require us to reduce our rates, forego future rate increases, provide greater features as part of our basic service plan or limit our rates for certain offerings. We cannot predict the ultimate impact, if any, of such changes on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nCertain of our RLECs charge rates for local services and intrastate access service based in part upon a rate-of-return authorized by the state regulatory commissions. These authorized rates are subject to audit at any time and may be reduced if the state regulatory commission finds them excessive. If any of our RLECs is ordered to reduce its rates or if its applications to increase rates are denied or delayed, our business, revenue and cash flow may be negatively impacted.\nNECA may file revisions to its average schedule formula each year, which revisions are subject to FCC approval. Six of our subsidiaries participate in average schedule rates. The FCC Order contains provisions which extend limits on corporate operations expense to the Interstate Common Line Support portions of the Universal Service Fund, which we refer to as the USF, which will reduce the level of funding some of our operating subsidiaries receive by approximately $0.1 million per year.\nA Further Reduction in Universal Service Fund High Cost Loop Support Would Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue and Cash Flow.\nThree of our RLECs receive federal USF HCL revenue to support their high cost of operations. Such support payments represented approximately 3.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and were based upon each participating RLEC\u2019s average cost per loop as compared to the national average cost per loop. These support payments fluctuate based upon the historical costs of our participating RLECs as compared to the national average cost per loop. Each year, the average cost per loop has increased, putting pressure on the USF HCL funds received by our participating RLECs to the extent that our participating RLECs\u2019 costs do not increase at the same rate. If our participating RLECs are unable to receive support from the USF HCL, or if such support is reduced, our business, revenue and cash flow would be negatively affected.\nOn October 27, 2011, the FCC adopted the FCC Order reforming the current high-cost universal support rules. The FCC Order places limits on certain operating expenses that can be recovered from the USF and places additional service requirements to be eligible to receive USF HCL support. The FCC has yet to issue orders addressing all aspects of the high-cost universal support which could affect the amount of USF HCL support we receive. We cannot predict the total impact these orders could have on USF HCL support. The outcome of any future FCC proceedings and other regulatory or legislative changes could affect the amount of USF HCL support that we receive, and could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. If a wireless or other telecommunication carrier receives ETC status in our service areas or even outside of our service areas, the amount of support we receive from the USF HCL could decline under current rules, and under some proposed USF HCL rule changes, could be significantly reduced.\nUSAC serves as the administrative agent to collect data and distribute funds for USF. In 2006, it began conducting High Cost Beneficiary audits, designed to ensure compliance with FCC rules and program requirements and to assist in program compliance. Carriers were chosen from a random sample of each type of ETC, including average schedule and cost companies, incumbents and competitors and rural and non-rural, from various states. Audits were designed to ensure proper designation of a carrier as ETC, accuracy of data submissions, documentation of accounting procedures, physical inventory of assets, true-up of projected data and samples of detailed documentation (for example, invoices, continuing property records). In 2012, USAC conducted payment quality audits of two of our RLECs and in-depth data valuation process audits on two of our RLECS. In 2013, USAC initiated in-depth data valuation process audits on two of our RLECs and a payment quality assurance audit on one of our RLECs. All audits have been completed and no material action is pending.\nIf We Were to Lose Our Protected Status Under Interconnection Rules, We Would Incur Additional Administrative and Regulatory Expenses and Face More Competition.\nAs a \u201crural telephone company\u201d under the Communications Act, each of our RLECs is exempt from the obligation to lease its unbundled facilities to CLECs, to offer retail services at wholesale prices for resale, to permit competitive co-location at its facilities and to comply with certain other requirements applicable to larger incumbent local exchange carriers. However, we eventually may be required to comply with these requirements in some or all of our service areas if: (i) we receive a bona fide request from a telecommunication carrier; and (ii) the state regulatory commissions, as applicable, determine that it is in the public interest to impose such requirements. In addition, we may be required to comply with some or all of these requirements in order to achieve greater pricing flexibility from state regulators. If we are required to comply with these requirements, we could incur additional administrative and regulatory expenses and face more competition which could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 13938, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "OTEL"}
