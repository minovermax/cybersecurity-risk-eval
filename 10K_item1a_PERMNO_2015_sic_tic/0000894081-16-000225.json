{"cik": "894081", "company": "Air Transport Services Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The risks below are not the only risks that the Company faces. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial or unlikely could also adversely affect the Company.\nThe economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the globe may negatively impact the demand for the Company\u2019s aircraft and services.\nAir cargo transportation volumes are strongly correlated to general economic conditions, including the price of aviation fuel. An economic downturn could reduce the demand for delivery services offered by DHL and other delivery businesses, in particular expedited shipping services utilizing aircraft. Further, during an economic slowdown, customers generally prefer to use ground-based or marine delivery services instead of more expensive air delivery services. Accordingly, an economic downturn could reduce the demand for airlift and cargo aircraft leases. Additionally, if the price of aviation fuel rises significantly, the demand for cargo aircraft and air delivery services may decline. During periods of downward economic trends and rising fuel costs, freight forwarders and integrated delivery businesses are more likely to defer market expansion plans. As a result, we may experience delays in the deployment of available aircraft with customers under lease, ACMI or charter arrangements.\nThe restated CMI agreement with DHL may impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition differently than historical results.\nThe restated CMI agreement, which was effective April 1, 2015, contains provisions that effect our operating results differently than the previous CMI agreement. Under the restated CMI agreement, the cost of Boeing 767 airframe maintenance is included in the pre-defined price for services that ABX charges to DHL. Previously, DHL was directly responsible for the costs of airframe maintenance of leased aircraft. Similarly, ABX may be required, under the restated CMI agreement, to pay certain costs associated with engine maintenance events, previously paid or reimbursed by DHL.\nOur costs incurred in providing airline services could be more than the contractual revenues generated.\nEach airline develops business proposals for ACMI, charter, DHL and other operating contracts by projecting operating costs, crew productivity and maintenance expenses. Projections contain key assumptions, including maintenance costs, flight hours, aircraft reliability, crewmember productivity and crewmember compensation and benefits. We may overestimate revenues, the level of crewmember productivity, and/or underestimate the actual costs of providing services when preparing business proposals. If actual costs are higher than projected or aircraft reliability is less than expected, future operating results may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s airlines rely on flight crews that are unionized. If collective bargaining agreements increase our costs and we cannot recover such increases, it may be necessary for us to terminate customer contracts or curtail planned growth. If disagreements arise, airline operations could be interrupted and business could be adversely affected until agreements are reached with the crewmembers.\nThe rate of aircraft deployments may impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition will depend in part on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to successfully deploy aircraft in operations that provide a positive return on investment. Our success will depend, in part, on their ability to secure additional cargo volumes from customers, in both U.S. and international markets. Deploying aircraft in international markets can pose additional risks, regulatory requirements and costs.\nThe actual demand for Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft may be less than we anticipate. The actual lease rates for aircraft available for lease may be less than we projected, or new leases may start later than we expect. Further, other airlines and lessors may be willing to offer aircraft to the market under terms more favorable to lessees.\nWe may fail to meet the scheduled delivery date for aircraft required by the ATSA.\nIf CAM cannot meet the agreed delivery schedule for an aircraft lease, AFS may, at its discretion, cancel the aircraft lease and all related lease payments.\nOur airline operating agreements include on-time reliability requirements which can impact the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our airline operating agreements contain monthly incentive payments for reaching specific on-time reliability thresholds. Additionally, such airline operating agreements contain monetary penalties for aircraft reliability below certain thresholds. As a result, our operating revenues may vary from period to period depending on the achievement of monthly incentives or the imposition of penalties. Further, an airline could be found in default of an agreement if it does not maintain minimum thresholds over an extended period of time. If our airlines are placed in default due to failure to maintain reliability thresholds, the customer may elect to terminate all or part of the services we provide under certain customer agreements after a cure period.\nIf ABX fails to maintain aircraft reliability above a minimum threshold under the restated CMI agreement for two consecutive calendar months or three months in a rolling twelve month period, ABX would be in default of the restated CMI agreement with DHL. In that event, DHL may elect to terminate the restated CMI agreement, unless ABX maintains the minimum reliability threshold during a 60-day cure period. If DHL terminates the CMI agreement due to an ABX event of default, ABX would be subject to a monetary penalty payable to DHL. The monetary penalty starts at $12 million through the first contract year, and amortizes to $3 million during the next two contract years of the restated CMI agreement.\nThe Investment Agreement may be terminated by Amazon in the event that clearance under applicable antitrust laws or DOT approval required for Amazon's exercise of the warrants is not obtained, or if stockholders do not approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of ATSG common stock required for the warrants issuable to Amazon and the exercise by Amazon to be exeercisable in full.\nUnder the recently executed agreements with Amazon, we have issued warrants which, upon their exercise in full, would exceed the number of ATSG common shares currently authorized by stockholders. The Company\u2019s stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company at the next annual meeting of stockholders to increase the number of authorized common shares and to approve the exercise in full of the related warrants. In the event that antitrust clearance or DOT approval is not obtained for Amazon's exercise of the warrants within six months of the applicable regulatory filing, or if stockholders do not approve at the next annual meeting the increase in the number of authorized common shares required for Amazon's exercise in full of the warrants, Amazon may elect to terminate the Investment Agreement. In the event of the termination of the Investment Agreement, the unvested portion of the warrants would be canceled and terminated. In addition, if Amazon terminated the Investment Agreement because the Company's stockholders did not approve the increase in the number of common shares required for Amazon's exercise in full of the warrants, under the terms of the ATSA, Amazon would have no obligation to (i) pay certain increased monthly charges associated with the operation of each the first five aircraft prior to the third anniversary of the ATSA and make a one-time payment in an amount constituting the difference between such increased monthly charges and the monthly charge then in effect between the execution of the ATSA and the third anniversary\ndate; (ii) enter into any aircraft lease with respect to any additional aircraft for which the scheduled delivery date comes after May 31, 2016; (iii) take delivery of any additional aircraft that are subject to a signed aircraft lease for which the scheduled delivery date comes after May 31, 2016 (Amazon will be entitled to terminate any such aircraft lease without penalty); or (iv) enter into any further work orders as provided under the ATSA.\nThe anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with Amazon may not be realized.\nWe entered into the agreements with Amazon with the expectation that the transactions would result in various benefits including, among others, growth in revenues, improved cash flows and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the agreements is subject to a number of challenges and uncertainties, such as the timing of aircraft deliveries and unforeseen costs. If we are unable to achieve our objectives or if we experience delays in our fleet expansion, the expected benefits may be only partially realized or not at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's future earnings and earnings per share, as reported under generally accepted accounting principles, will be impacted by the stock warrants issuable to Amazon.\nWe expect that the warrants issuable to Amazon will increase the number of diluted shares reported. Further, we expect that the warrants will be subject to fair value measurements during the periods that they are outstanding. Accordingly, future fluctuations in the fair value of the warrants may adversely impact the Company's reported earnings measures.\nUnder the provisions of airline operating and aircraft lease agreements with customers, customers may be able to terminate the operating agreements or aircraft lease agreements, subject to early termination provisions.\nCustomers can typically terminate one or more of the aircraft from their related airline operating agreement for convenience at any time during the term, subject to a 60 day notice period and paying the Company a fee. Additionally, the lease agreements may contain provisions for terminating an aircraft lease for convenience, including a notice period and paying a lump sum amount to the Company.\nAmazon may terminate the ATSA in its entirety after providing 180 days of advance notice after the first six months of the term and paying to the Company a significant termination fee which reduces after the second anniversary of the ATSA.\nDHL may terminate the restated CMI agreement in its entirety after providing 180 days of advance notice after the first six months of the term and paying a significant termination fee which amortizes down during the term.\nThe U.S. Military may not renew our contracts or may reduce the number of routes that we operate.\nOur contracts with the U.S. Military are typically for one year and are not required to be renewed. The U.S. Military may terminate the contracts for convenience or in the event we were to fail to satisfy reliability requirements or for other reasons. The number and frequency of routes is sensitive to changes in military priorities and U.S. defense budgets.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by adverse audit findings by the U.S. Government.\nOur U.S. Military contracts are subject to audit by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If an audit uncovers improprieties, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including termination of such contracts, forfeiture of profits, fines and suspension from doing business with the U.S. Military.\nOur participation in the CRAF Program could adversely restrict our commercial business in times of national emergency.\nBoth of our airlines participate in the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (\u201cCRAF\u201d) Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize participants\u2019 aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft.\nProposed rules from the DOT, FAA and TSA could increase the Company's operating costs and reduce customer utilization of airfreight.\nNew FAA rules for Flightcrew Member Duty and Rest Requirements (FMDRR) for passenger airline operations became effective in January 2014. The new rules apply to our operation of combi aircraft for the U.S military and impact the required amount and timing of rest periods for pilots between work assignments and modified duty and rest requirements based on the time of day, number of scheduled segments, flight types, time zones and other factors. Failure to remain in compliance with these rules may subject us to fines or other enforcement action.\nIf applied to cargo carriers, the new rules would require a pilot to have the opportunity to rest for nine hours before reporting to flight duty and place other restrictions on the number of duty hours in particular time periods. In May 2012, the FAA indicated that it would reconsider its initial decision to exclude cargo pilots from these new requirements. On reconsideration, the FAA\u2019s original finding was confirmed by the agency. However, the FAA\u2019s determination has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the outcome of which is currently pending. Also, efforts have been made to mandate the FMDRR be applied to cargo carriers by amendment to the federal transportation statute. While not currently required for the Company's cargo operations, if such rest requirements and restrictions were imposed on our cargo operations, these rules could have a significant impact on the costs incurred by our airlines. The airlines would attempt to pass such additional costs through to their customers in the form of price increases. Customers, as a result, may seek to reduce their utilization of aircraft in favor of less expensive transportation alternatives.\nThe concentration of aircraft types and engines in the Company's airlines could adversely affect our operating and financial results.\nThe combined aircraft fleet is concentrated in two aircraft types. If any of these aircraft types encounter technical difficulties that resulted in significant FAA airworthiness directives or grounding, our ability to lease the aircraft would be adversely impacted, as would our airlines' operations. The market growth in demand for the Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft types and configurations may be less than we anticipate. Customers may develop preferences for the Airbus A300-600 and A330 aircraft or other mid-size aircraft types, instead of the Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft.\nThe cost of aircraft repairs and unexpected delays in the time required to complete aircraft maintenance could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur aircraft provide ACMI services throughout the world, sometimes operating in remote regions. Our aircraft may experience maintenance events in locations that do not have the necessary repair capabilities or are difficult to reach. As a result, we may incur additional expenses and lose billable revenues that we would have otherwise earned. Under the restated CMI agreement with DHL, we are required to provide a spare aircraft while scheduled maintenance is completed. If delays occur in the completion of aircraft maintenance, we may incur additional expense to provide airlift capacity and forgo revenues.\nLessees of our aircraft may fail to make contractual payments or fail to maintain the aircraft as required.\nOur financial results depend on our lease customers' ability to make rent payments and maintain the related aircraft. Our customers' ability to make payments could be adversely impacted by changes to their financial liquidity, competitiveness, economic conditions and other factors. A default of an aircraft lease by a customer could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows and result in the repossession of aircraft.\nWhile we often require leasing customers to pay monthly maintenance deposits, customers are normally responsible for maintaining our aircraft during the lease term. Failure of a customer to perform required maintenance and maintain the appropriate records during the lease term could result in higher maintenance costs, a decrease in the value of the aircraft, a lengthy delay in or even our inability to place the aircraft in a subsequent lease, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to modify aircraft and provide aircraft and engine maintenance.\nWe rely on certain third party aircraft modification service providers and aircraft and engine maintenance service providers that have expertise or resources that we do not have. Third party service providers may seek to impose price increases that could negatively affect our competitiveness in the airline markets. An unexpected termination or delay involving service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. A delay in an aircraft modification could adversely impact our revenues and our ability to place the aircraft in the market. We must\nmanage third party service providers to meet schedules and turn-times and to control costs in order to remain competitive to our customers.\nDelta TechOps, a division of Delta Airlines, Inc., is the primary engine maintenance provider for the Company's General Electric CF6 engines that power our fleet of Boeing 767-200 aircraft. If Delta TechOps does not complete the refurbishment of our engines within the contractual turn-times or if we must replace Delta TechOps as the maintenance provider for some or all of the Company's CF6 engines, our operations and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company's operating results could be negatively impacted by disruptions of its information technology and communication systems.\nOur businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyberattacks, natural disasters, power failures, telecommunication outages, or other causes. Certain disruptions could prevent our airlines from flying as scheduled, possibly for an extended period of time, which could have a negative impact on our operating results and reliability. We continually monitor the risks of disruption, take preventative measures, develop backup plans and maintain redundancy capabilities. The measures we use may not prevent the causes of disruptions we could experience or help us recover failed systems quickly.\nThe costs of maintaining preventive maintenance measures may continue to rise. Further, the costs of recovering or replacing a failed system could be very expensive.\nThe costs of our aircraft maintenance facilities could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe lease and operate a 310,000 square foot aircraft maintenance facility and a 100,000 square foot component repair shop in Wilmington, Ohio. Accordingly, a large portion of our MRO's operating costs are fixed. As a result, we need to retain existing aircraft maintenance business levels to maintain a profitable operation. The actual level of revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. Additionally, revenues from aircraft maintenance can vary among periods due to the timing of scheduled maintenance events and the completion level of work during a period.\nThe Company could violate debt covenants.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains covenants including, among other requirements, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and guarantees of indebtedness. The Senior Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of the Company's Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft that are not collateralized under aircraft loans. Under the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain aircraft collateral coverage equal to 150% of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the maximum capacity of the revolving credit facility or 175% of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the total funded revolving credit facility, whichever is less. The Senior Credit Agreement stipulates events of default, including unspecified events that may have material adverse effects on the Company. The Senior Credit Agreement and aircraft loans cross default. If an event of default occurs, the Company may be forced to repay, renegotiate or replace the Senior Credit Agreement and loans. In such an event, the Company\u2019s cost of borrowings could increase, and our ability to modify and deploy aircraft could be limited as a result.\nThe Company's share buy-back plan may reduce liquidity.\nDuring 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan to buy up to $50 million of ATSG 's common stock. Future purchases, if any, would be funded from the Company's cash balances and could reduce the Company's financial liquidity and indirectly add to the Company's indebtedness.\nThe Company's existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient if opportunities to expand the aircraft fleet or make strategic investment in other companies arise.\nOpportunities to grow revenues could arise that require more aircraft, an aircraft type that we do not currently have, or other strategic investments. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's liquidity included $17.7 million of cash balances and $136.6 million available under the revolving credit facility through the Senior Credit Agreement and, subject to the creditors consent, $50 million through an accordion feature of the Senior Credit Agreement. The existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to support initiatives for fleet expansion or other strategic investments. Raising additional sources of credit could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and additional covenant requirements.\nOperating results may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative instruments from time to time in conjunction with its debt levels. The Company's Senior Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain derivative instruments for fluctuating interest rates for at least 50% of the outstanding balance of the new unsubordinated term loan. We typically do not designate the derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Future fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates will result in the recording of gains and losses on interest rate derivatives that the Company holds.\nUnder the Senior Credit Agreement, interest rates are adjusted quarterly based on the prevailing LIBOR or prime rates and a ratio of the Company's outstanding debt level to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (\"EBITDA\"). At the Company's current debt-to-EBITDA ratio, the unsubordinated term loan and the revolving credit facility both bear a variable interest rate of 2.18%. Additional debt or lower EBITDA may result in higher interest rates on the variable rate portion of the Company's debt.\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare plans for certain eligible employees. The Company's related pension expense, plans' funded status and funding requirements are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The plans' funded status and annual pension expense are recalculated at the beginning of each calendar year using the fair value of plan assets and market-based interest rates at that point in time, as well as assumptions for asset returns and other actuarial assumptions. Future fluctuations in interest rates including the impact on asset returns, could result in the recording of additional expense for pension and other post-retirement healthcare plans.\nThe costs of insurance coverage or changes to our reserves for self-insured claims could affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company is self-insured for certain claims related to workers\u2019 compensation, aircraft, automobile, general liability and employee healthcare. We record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported. Accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data and recent claims trends. Changes in claim severity and frequency could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be further limited.\nLimitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nChanges in the ownership of the Company on the part of significant shareholders could limit our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of significant stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nWe may need to reduce the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThe Company owns a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and related equipment. Additionally, the balance sheet reflects assets for income tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The removal of aircraft from service or continual losses from aircraft operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those aircraft, related parts and equipment and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airlines were to lose its authority to operate, it could be necessary to record an impairment charge.\nIf the Company incurs operating losses or our estimates of expected future earnings indicate a decline, it may be necessary to reassess the need for a valuation allowance for some or all of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets.\nPenalties, fines and sanctions levied by governmental agencies or the costs of complying with government regulations could negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to complex aviation, transportation, security, environmental, labor, employment and other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally require our subsidiaries to maintain and comply with a wide variety of certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals. Their inability to maintain required certificates, permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or, in the case of DOT and FAA requirements, possible suspension or revocation of their authority to conduct operations.\nThe costs of maintaining our aircraft in compliance with government regulations could negatively affect our results of operations and require further investment in our aircraft fleet.\nAll aircraft in the Company\u2019s fleet were manufactured prior to 1995. Manufacturer Service Bulletins and FAA regulations and FAA airworthiness directives issued under its \u201cAging Aircraft\u201d program cause operators of such aged aircraft to be subject to additional inspections and modifications to address problems of corrosion and structural fatigue at specified times. The FAA may issue airworthiness directives that could require significant inspections and major modifications to such aircraft. The FAA may issue airworthiness directives that could limit the usability of certain aircraft types. In 2012, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive that requires the replacement of the aft pressure bulkhead on Boeing 767-200 aircraft based on a certain number of landing cycles. As a result, we expect that 24 of the Company's Boeing 767-200 aircraft will be affected. The cost of compliance is estimated to be $1.0 million per aircraft over the next ten years.\nIn addition, FAA regulations require that aircraft manufacturers establish limits on aircraft flight cycles to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft, as described in Item 1 of this report, under \"Federal Aviation Administration.\" These regulations may increase our maintenance costs and eventually limit the use of our aircraft.\nThe FAA and ICAO are in the process of developing programs to modernize air traffic control and management systems. The FAA's program, Next Generation Air Transportation Systems, is an integrated system that requires updating aircraft navigation and communication equipment. The FAA has mandated the replacement of current ground based radar systems with more accurate satellite based systems on our aircraft by 2020. The ICAO is phasing in similar requirements for aircraft operating in Europe, beginning in 2015. These programs may increase our costs and limit the use of our aircraft. Aircraft not equipped with advanced communication systems may be restricted to certain airspace.\nFailure to maintain the operating certificates and authorities of our airlines would adversely affect our business.\nThe airline subsidiaries have the necessary authority to conduct flight operations pursuant to the economic authority issued by the DOT and the safety based authority issued by the FAA. The continued effectiveness of such authority is subject to their compliance with applicable statutes and DOT, FAA and TSA rules and regulations, including any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future. The loss of such authority by an airline subsidiary could cause a default of covenants within the Senior Credit Agreement and would materially and adversely affect its airline operations, effectively eliminating the airline's ability to operate air services.\nThe Company may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such potential climate change.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments regarding air quality and other matters. In part, because of the highly industrialized nature of many of the locations where the Company operates, there can be no assurance that we have discovered all environmental contamination or other matters for which the Company may be responsible.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant federal, state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The European Commission has mandated the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (\"ETS\") for greenhouse gas emissions to the airline industry. Under the European Union ETS, all ABX and ATI flights that are wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. Exceedance of the airlines' emission allowances would require the airlines to purchase additional emission allowances on the open market.\nRecently, ICAO proposed for adoption greenhouse gas emissions rules applicable to aviation. If the rules are adopted by the ICAO governing body, they would set emissions standards beginning in 2020. The mechanism to reduce emissions is based on a reduction in the amount of fuel burned during the cruise portion of flight. The engines used to power the aircraft currently operated by the Company's airlines comply with the newly proposed standard and would not require modification to be able to continue to operate after the rule, if adopted as proposed, takes effect.\nThe U.S. Congress and certain states have also considered legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, even in the absence of such legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could regulate greenhouse gas emissions, especially aircraft engine emissions. The cost to comply with potential new laws and regulations could be substantial for the Company. These costs could include an increase in the cost of fuel and capital costs associated with updating aircraft. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on the Company\u2019s cost structure or operating results. Further, even without such legislation or regulation, increased awareness and adverse publicity in the global marketplace about greenhouse gas emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services.", "PERMNO": 90716, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "ATSG"}
