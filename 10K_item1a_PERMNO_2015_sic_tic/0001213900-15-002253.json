{"cik": "1527728", "company": "DanDrit Biotech USA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in the risk factors listed below. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed, the price of our common stock could decline, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DANDRIT\u2019S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nDanDrit lacks an established operating history on which to evaluate its business and determine if it will be able to execute our business plan, and can give no assurance that operations will result in profits.\nDanDrit was formed in Delaware in January 2011 as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. On February 12, 2014, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, DanDrit USA completed the acquisition of approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark, a Danish corporation formed in 2001, and as a result became DanDrit Denmark\u2019s parent company. DanDrit has a limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate its business. DanDrit has not begun sales of its products, and cannot say with certainty when it will begin to achieve profitability. No assurance can be made that DanDrit will ever become profitable.\nDanDrit has incurred losses in prior periods and expects to incur losses in the future. DanDrit may never be profitable.\nDanDrit had net losses at December 31, 2014 and 2013 of $2,370,883 and $2,147,361, respectively. DanDrit expects to continue to sustain losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs sales of DanDrit\u2019s products have generated minimal operating revenues, DanDrit has relied on loans and on sales of its debt and equity securities to continue operations. If DanDrit is unable to raise funds through sales of its securities, there can be no assurance that DanDrit will be able to implement its business plan, generate sustainable revenue or ever achieve profitable operations. DanDrit expects to have operating losses until such time as it develops a substantial and stable revenue base. DanDrit cannot assure you that it can achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nDanDrit may not be able to develop its vaccine candidates to yield satisfactory results and they may never be approved for use by regulatory authorities. If DanDrit is unable to successfully commercialize its vaccines, its prospects, financial position, results of operations and future opportunities will be materially adversely affected.\nNone of DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates has completed full clinical development. Because DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates generally belong to new classes of cell therapy, they will require extensive further development, testing and funding before we can seek regulatory approval for any of these vaccines.\nDanDrit\u2019s prospects in the short term, including DanDrit\u2019s ability to generate revenue and make new strategic alliances, depend on DanDrit\u2019s ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize its current vaccine candidates with satisfactory results. If DanDrit fails to develop the medicines DanDrit has in its pipeline, it will have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nThere can be no assurance that DanDrit will succeed in implementing its Phase IIb/III clinical trials for advanced colorectal cancer so that the results of these clinical trials will support further preclinical or clinical studies, or that DanDrit will be able to develop new vaccine candidates or successfully commercialize any of those cancer vaccine candidates at a later time. If DanDrit does not do this, we cannot achieve our growth potential and this will have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s prospects, financial position, results of operations and future opportunities.\nResults of our early clinical trials do not insure future success.\nThe results of early clinical trials may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Achieving positive results in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not constitute any assurance that in future clinical trials sufficient data can be obtained to document a vaccine candidate\u2019s efficacy and safety. The safety and efficacy of a vaccine candidate in development must be supported by extensive data from preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry and in the biopharmaceutical industry, including companies that have greater resources and more experience than DanDrit, have achieved significant negative results in clinical phase IIb and III trials, even after obtaining promising results in preclinical and early clinical studies. Results that are considered acceptable in early clinical studies may not be confirmed or may be interpreted differently in subsequent studies. DanDrit cannot predict whether the clinical phase IIb and III and other clinical trials that may be implemented will demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market any of DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates.\nNegative or non-satisfactory results of clinical trials involving DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates could lead to DanDrit or its collaborators having to perform additional nonclinical and/or clinical trials, which could result in higher costs and significantly delay the marketing authorization application for such vaccine candidates by the regulatory authority, or could lead to an application for a more narrowly defined use, or another indication for the vaccine candidate than originally expected. Such results could also lead to the complete elimination of a vaccine candidate. If any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n\u25cf execute on product candidate development activities;\n\u25cf obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf gain market acceptance for our products;\n\u25cf develop and maintain any strategic relationships we elect to enter into; and;\n\u25cf manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercialization.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nDanDrit will be dependent on collaboration and licensing arrangements to develop and commercialize its products. These relationships may be unsuccessful and may not result in the development of vaccine candidates. In that case, our business, financial condition and growth opportunities will be materially adversely affected.\nDanDrit expects to depend on collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties who we expect will provide additional personnel and other resources and funding required to develop and commercialize its products. Until these relationships are established, our plans for developing some of our vaccines may be uncertain. There can be no assurance that DanDrit will be able to enter into or maintain these agreements, that the results of these agreements will further the development of a vaccine, or that DanDrit will receive income from these agreements. Furthermore, collaborators that we anticipate may enter into agreements with us may change their priorities; make reallocation of resources; terminate the agreements; end or further delay the development of vaccine candidates; downgrade or change plans or strategies for regulatory approval or commercialization of the vaccine candidate; find it difficult to retain key employees; or be taken over by companies that are our competitors.\nWe expect that these collaboration and licensing agreements will entitle us to milestone payments and a percentage of sales related to the vaccine candidates that are commercialized. If a third party with which DanDrit has established a collaboration or licensing arrangement stops the development of a vaccine candidate, there can be no assurance that all rights in respect of the vaccine candidate will be reassigned to us. A transfer of these rights may be delayed for various reasons, which may result in the delay of all work performed for the vaccine candidate.\nSince we are dependent on third parties to develop and commercialize our product candidates, any change in these anticipated relationships will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and future growth opportunities.\nRegulatory requirements and regulations could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit.\nDanDrit\u2019s products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including public and/or regulatory limits set by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). These laws and regulations, including those relating to reporting on safety, product safety and advertising and marketing of products cover all aspects of DanDrit\u2019s business.\nDanDrit and/or any future third party with which it has an effective collaboration or licensing agreement may be subject to changes in applicable governmental regulations and/or regulatory framework and be subject to additional or more onerous restrictions, which may make it necessary to make changes to personnel, facilities or procedures that could result in increased costs and adversely affect DanDrit\u2019s business activities, including the development and commercialization of DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates.\nIf DanDrit or its affiliates do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements or comply with significant legislative changes DanDrit or its affiliates can be fined or risk having regulatory approvals suspended or withdrawn, risking recall or seizure of products, restrictions on activities and/or civil or criminal prosecution, which could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that our vaccine candidates will be approved by the regulating agencies.\nAs long as the relevant regulatory authorities have not considered and approved applications for DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates (New Drug Application (NDA) or equivalent) DanDrit and its affiliates cannot commercialize DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates. Production and marketing of DanDrit\u2019s products and DanDrit\u2019s ongoing research and development activities are subject to rules set by numerous public authorities throughout the world. The regulatory authorities of each country can set their own requirements and may refuse to approve a product or may require additional data before approving a product, even if the product is approved by another regulating agency. Approvals may include restrictions on the marketing or use of products, which could adversely affect the amount of DanDrit\u2019s revenue from the sale of those products.\nWe are conducting, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for MCV or any future product candidates in sites outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside of the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from our clinical trial conducted outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials within the United States, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of MCV or any future vaccine candidates.\nIn connection with the anticipated filing of our IND application with the FDA, we plan to submit trial results for trials we did not sponsor, which the FDA may refuse to consider.\nDanDrit was only a sponsor of one of the clinical trials completed to date for MCV while DanDrit Denmark employees and certain affiliates were closely involved in the design of the studies and the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data of all three studies. As a result, DanDrit intends to present all applicable data with respect to the current trials that is available to it, regardless of DanDrit\u2019s specific role in any one of the trials. There are no assurances that the FDA will accept any data that DanDrit submits in support of its IND application for any clinical trial in which it was not a sponsor or principal investigator.\nThere can be no assurance that regulators will complete their review process in a timely manner, or that DanDrit vaccine candidates will obtain regulatory approval.\nIf DanDrit or any third party with which we have an effective collaboration or licensing agreement experience difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the development and commercialization of our vaccine candidates may be significantly delayed or even discontinued. Such difficulties or delays could result in significantly increased development costs and/or a delay or elimination of payments to us from our collaborators. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nDanDrit will be dependent on external suppliers of certain services and technologies.\nDanDrit will be dependent on a number of external parties such as contract laboratories and clinical research organizations, and in some cases our collaborators to:\n\u25cf Implement preclinical studies (pharmacology, toxicology testing and safety pharmacological evaluations).\n\u25cf Provide DanDrit with vaccine materials and support DanDrit\u2019s activities related to preclinical and clinical studies.\n\u25cf Implement, inspect and/or monitor some or all aspects of the preclinical or clinical studies with DanDrit\u2019s product candidates.\n\u25cf Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements such as Good Clinical Practice (\u201cGCP\u201d), Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201cGMP\u201d) and Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d).\n\u25cf Deliver IT services.\n\u25cf Produce vaccine drugs and vaccines in accordance with GMP.\nThe third parties DanDrit depends on may not be available when needed, or might not, if available, comply with all statutory and contractual requirements, and/or otherwise provide their services in a timely manner or in an acceptable manner.\nDanDrit is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel for the planning and execution of research and development; preparation of applications for intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals; and negotiating and maintaining cooperation with existing and new partners is essential for DanDrit.\nThere can be no assurance that DanDrit will be able to attract and retain such persons in light of demand for experienced employees from numerous pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, specialized biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. DanDrit\u2019s employment contracts contain no limitation on competition that would prevent DanDrit\u2019s current employees from being employed by DanDrit\u2019s competitors or partners, if they choose to leave DanDrit.\nDanDrit may in the future require additional expertise and manpower in areas such as preclinical trials, management of clinical trials, regulatory affairs, marketing, business development and management of partnerships. Inability to obtain or develop such expertise, or hire the employees it needs, on reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nIf our employees commit fraud or other misconduct, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, our business may experience serious adverse consequences.\nDanDrit is exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nDanDrit\u2019s products may not achieve market acceptance. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nThe drugs DanDrit or its collaborators may develop may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payers and the medical community, even if they are approved for marketing. The degree of market acceptance of the products approved for sale depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf The ability of DanDrit or its collaborators to demonstrate the clinical efficacy, safety and benefits of the products.\n\u25cf The ability of DanDrit or its collaborators to demonstrate that the product has advantages over existing therapies or new alternative treatments.\n\u25cf The frequency and severity of any adverse effects arising from the use of the products.\n\u25cf The price of the products.\n\u25cf The subsidies DanDrit receives.\n\u25cf Efficacy within the therapeutic range for the illnesses the products are directed towards.\n\u25cf Patient comfort and user administration.\n\u25cf Requirements for marketing.\n\u25cf The level of support for marketing and distribution.\nWe have no control over most of these factors. Furthermore, it may be difficult for us, to the extent that competitors are able to commercialize competing products before our vaccine candidates obtain regulatory approval, to develop a market for a vaccine because doctors, patients or third-party payers may have become accustomed to using a competing, existing product or for other reasons, even though our drug may be more effective or has other advantages.\nIf any of the vaccines we develop fail to achieve market acceptance in the future, we may not be able to generate significant revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nThe use of DanDrit\u2019s drugs or vaccine candidates may lead to unforeseen side effects. If any of our drugs or vaccine candidates is deemed to be unsafe, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities could be materially adversely affected.\nAll drugs are associated with a risk of allergic, immunologic genes or hyper-sensitivities. We test for allergic and immunological genes actions in preclinical and clinical studies, but if any of our products cause other allergic or immunological reactions than those considered acceptable by patients, doctors or regulatory authorities, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that will cause delays and increase costs for the development of a product, or development may have to be terminated or suspended on the grounds that participants will be exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nEven in cases where pre-clinical or clinical studies have been successful, or received regulatory approval, a product can later prove to be unsafe. The incidence of adverse events may make it necessary for us and for our collaborators to carry out further investigations and studies. If a product is determined to be unsafe, we and our collaborators can be fined or risk having regulatory approvals suspended or withdrawn, be required to cease selling activities relating to the product, be required to recall the product, be subject to seizure of products, or be exposed to civil or criminal prosecution. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nThird party reimbursement and reform measures on health care could have a material adverse effect on the commercial success of DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates.\nMarket acceptance of DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates depends in part on the extent to which the public and private health insurance and other third-party payers will subsidize DanDrit\u2019s drugs.\nGovernments, insurance companies and health organizations are increasingly seeking to reduce healthcare costs by limiting coverage, price and reimbursement levels of new vaccine products as well as in some cases rejecting coverage. Reimbursement practices vary significantly from country to country, and some countries require that products undergo a lengthy review by the authorities before they meet the public support requirements.\nIn the United States, in Canada and in many other countries, pricing and/or profitability of some or all prescription pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals are subject to varying degrees of government control. Healthcare reform and controls on healthcare spending may limit the price we charge for any products and the amounts thereof that we can sell. In particular, in the United States, the federal government and private insurers have changed and have considered ways to change, the manner in which healthcare services are provided. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the healthcare industry.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe anticipate that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the reimbursement we may receive for any approved product. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which in turn serves as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. CMS also recently proposed to re-examine payment amounts for tests reimbursed under the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule due to changes in technology and, in addition, proposed to bundle the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting. Such changes went into effect January 1, 2014. Levels of reimbursement may be impacted by current and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors in a manner that may harm the demand and reimbursement available for our products, which in turn could harm our future product pricing and sales. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nThere may be delays or difficulties in the recruitment and monitoring of patients in clinical trials. Any such delays could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nAll clinical development of new vaccine candidates depends on the recruitment of volunteer suitable patients for clinical trials. The ability to recruit patients depends on certain factors, including the prevalence of the disease in the population. It may be more difficult to find a sufficient number of patients to participate in clinical trials for drugs being developed for a disease that is common among the general population. Even if a disease is frequent among the population, there may be a number of other companies developing drugs that target the same disease who may eventually have more success in recruiting among the total group of potential patients for their clinical studies. If we or our collaborators find it difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients to participate in clinical trials for one of its vaccine candidates DanDrit and/or its collaborators may have to postpone or discontinue ongoing clinical trials. Delays may also result in increased costs for clinical studies and may affect the implementation of studies required for a vaccine candidate\u2019s approval. Delay or complete termination of a clinical trial program could have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nDanDrit may not be able to make, or cause others to conduct, animal testing in the future. This could have a material adverse effect on our research and development work.\nResearch into dendritic cell vaccines does not generally involve animals. But, certain aspects of DanDrit\u2019s biotechnology research and development may be carried out on animals. Changes to laws and regulations, recognized clinical procedures, or experimental protocols may have a negative impact on this research and development. Pressure from society, which may lead to restrictions on the use of animals or result in actions against DanDrit, its affiliates or its clinical research organizations from groups of people or individuals who are against animal testing may also have a material adverse effect on research and development work.\nDanDrit faces extensive competition. If our vaccine candidates cannot compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities could be materially, adversely affected.\nThere is extensive competition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the technology is developing rapidly. DanDrit is developing a vaccine for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, where competing products may be introduced. If these newly developed products are more efficient, cheaper, more patient-friendly, safer, or better placed than DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates, or if DanDrit\u2019s competitors develop drugs that reduce or eliminate the need for DanDrit\u2019s vaccine candidates, such competition could reduce or eliminate DanDrit\u2019s commercial opportunities. Many of DanDrit\u2019s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than DanDrit and significantly more experience than DanDrit with preclinical and clinical research and development and in obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products.\nDanDrit\u2019s drugs may face competition as a result of many factors, including the route of administration (e.g. oral administration vs. injection), the availability and cost of production, efficiency of DanDrit\u2019s partners\u2019 marketing and sales efforts as well as the price of DanDrit\u2019s products. DanDrit has limited or no previous experience in these areas. DanDrit\u2019s inability to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on DanDrit\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities.\nDanDrit is likely to be exposed to product liability claims. If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, our insurance may be inadequate. If a judgment were to exceed our insurance coverage, our business could be materially, adversely affected.\nDanDrit will be exposed, by virtue of the nature of its business, to the risk of potential product liability claims, which is a natural part of the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of drugs. Even in cases where DanDrit has granted licenses to third parties to manufacture and sell its products, there can be no assurance that DanDrit will not be included in any product liability claims relating to these medicines, or claims by third parties, including DanDrit\u2019s partners, for indemnity or other compensation from DanDrit in connection with any such claims.\nWe plan to obtain product liability insurance coverage once our clinical trials commence. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain this product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe have insufficient funds to develop our business, which may adversely affect our future growth, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which would force us to terminate, delay, reduce or suspend our operations, research and development programs and other commercialization efforts.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize our products. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had approximately $5,038,333 and $96,262 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. We may need to sell equity securities or borrow funds in order to develop these growth strategies and our inability to raise the additional capital and/or borrow the funds needed to implement these plans may adversely affect our business and future growth.\nOur future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors including:\n\u25cf our clinical trial results, rates of progress and costs;\n\u25cf the cost, timing and outcomes of seeking FDA and other regulatory authority approval of our products;\n\u25cf the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and the cost of defending our patents;\n\u25cf the cost of prosecuting infringement actions against third parties;\n\u25cf subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue received from sales of approved products, if any, in the future;\n\u25cf any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n\u25cf the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u25cf the costs associated with being a public company.\nBased on our current operating plan, we anticipate that our existing resources will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our currently planned operations, including our continued product development, at least through December 31, 2018.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our operational or development efforts. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to MCV or potential future product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights.\nIf we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or suspend one or more of our clinical studies or research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nRaising capital in the future could cause dilution to our existing shareholders, and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nIn the future, we may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe depend on intellectual property and the failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees, customers, collaborators and others to protect our intellectual property. However, some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application, and, despite precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.\nWe do not know whether any patents will be issued from pending or future patent applications or whether the scope of the issued patents is sufficiently broad to protect our technologies or processes. The patent position of biotechnology companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from our pending patent applications. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology.\nWe endeavor to aggressively protect our technologies through patents covering compositions of matter, drug targets and aspects of mechanism of action, drug product formulation, methods of use and methods of manufacture, and trade secrets. We have filed patent applications and in-licensed others with respect to our technology both domestically and internationally and anticipate filing multiple patent applications, in the future. While we believe that we will be able to secure adequate and enforceable patent protection for our products and technologies, there is no guarantee that patent protection can be obtained, and even if it is obtained that such patent protection will ultimately be deemed valid, sufficiently enforceable, sufficient to preclude competition or not infringe upon the rights of other parties. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and Denmark.\nThe patents protecting our proprietary technologies expire after a period of time. Currently, our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2026. Although we have attempted to incorporate technology from our core patents into specific patented product applications, product designs and packaging to extend the lives of our patents, this approach may not be successful in protecting our proprietary technology. If we are not successful in protecting our proprietary technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. Any infringement upon our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop our products and sell them commercially.\nIssued patents covering one or more of our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. If that were to happen, our business would be adversely impacted.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our product candidates or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our products.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. If a court held that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us.\nUnfavorable outcomes in intellectual property litigation could limit our research and development activities and/or our ability to commercialize certain products.\nIf third parties successfully assert intellectual property rights against us, we might be barred from using certain aspects of our technology, or barred from developing and commercializing certain products. Prohibitions against using certain technologies, or prohibitions against commercializing certain products, could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a plaintiff. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending against allegations of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets, we may be forced to pay substantial damage awards to the plaintiff. There is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation, including intellectual property litigation. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property litigation, even if the case against us is weak or flawed. If litigation leads to an outcome unfavorable to us, we may be required to obtain a license from the patent owner in order to continue our research and development programs or to market our product(s). It is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. This could limit our research and development activities, our ability to commercialize certain products, or both.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any future collaborators to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on other methods to protect our trade secrets, technical know-how, and proprietary information. In the course of our research and development activities and our business activities, we often rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to vendors of laboratory or clinical development services or potential collaborators. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, and our confidentiality agreements are carefully drafted to protect our proprietary interests. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures.\nTrade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or outside collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely impact financial performance.\nOur reporting currency is the United States dollar. Because of our activities in Denmark, the United Kingdom and continental Europe, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We may manage the risk to such exposure by entering into foreign currency futures and option contracts. Foreign currency fluctuations may have a significant effect on our operations in the future.\nAssuming that our vaccine candidates receive regulatory approval and we begin sales of these products, our results may fluctuate due to certain regulatory, marketing and competitive factors over which we have little or no control.\nAssuming that our vaccine candidates receive regulatory approval and we begin the sale of these products, the factors listed below, some of which we cannot control, may cause our revenue and results of operations to fluctuate significantly:\n\u25cf Actions taken by regulatory bodies relating to the verification, registration or health effects of our products.\n\u25cf The extent to which existing and newly developed products obtain market acceptance.\n\u25cf The timing and size of customer purchases.\n\u25cf Customer concerns about the stability of our business, which could cause them to seek alternatives to our solutions and products; and\n\u25cf Increases in raw material costs.\nWe will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses which, to date, have been in excess of $300,000 annually. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls as well as mandating certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives.\nIf we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately, or maintain internal control systems adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock pricemay suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our assets and the majority of our officers and directors are located outside of the United States and therefore it may be difficult for an investor to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or such officers and directors.\nA significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, the majority of our officers and directors are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of such persons\u2019 assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for an investor to effect service of process or enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in other jurisdictions against us, or such officers and directors predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur majority stockholders will control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors, and five percent stockholders collectively own approximately 48% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, these stockholders and previous stockholders of the Company\u2019s subsidiary, DanDrit Denmark entered into a voting agreement in connection with the Merger, whereby they agreed to vote in favor of nominees for directors selected by the parties to the voting agreement as described herein. As a result, such entities and individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our controlling stockholders. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company.\nAn investment in our company should be considered illiquid.\nAn investment in our company requires a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. Because we became a reporting company other than by the traditional means of conducting an initial public offering of our common stock, we may be unable to establish a liquid market for our common stock. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite primary or secondary offerings on behalf of our company or its stockholders in the future than they would if we had become a public reporting company by means of an initial public offering of common stock. If all or any of the foregoing risks occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our company.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nPresently, our common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Markets, or OTC.QB, and we are in our early stages, therefore, an investment in our company will require a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. Presently there is limited trading in our stock and in the absence of an active trading market:\n\u25cf investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u25cf market visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited; and\n\u25cf a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe lack of an active market impairs your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nEven if an active trading market for our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile.\nEven if an active market for our common stock develops, of which no assurances can be given, the market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u25cf conditions in markets generally\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices of biotechnology companies like ours have been highly volatile due to factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf any delay or failure to conduct a clinical trial for our product or receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory agents;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our product\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u25cf failure to complete significant transactions or collaborate with vendors in manufacturing our product.\nThe securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is presently subject to these regulations which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, excluding the net value of the person\u2019s primary residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with the investor\u2019s spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d. Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of purchasers of our shares of common stock to sell such securities.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit investors\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit our investors\u2019 ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nInvestors may face significant restrictions on the resale of your shares due to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (1) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.\nWe do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell, and on purchasers to buy, our securities. Our investors should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited, as investors may be unable to resell their shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to and may rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u25cf have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u25cf submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay\u201d, \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden parachute;\u201d and\n\u25cf disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are not choosing to \u201copt out\u201d of this provision. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nUntil such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be re-invested into the Company to further its business strategy. Because we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future, the only opportunity for our stockholders to realize the creation of value in our common stock will likely be through a sale of those shares.\nWe have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. No preferred stock is currently issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock are presently issued and outstanding and we have no immediate plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could adversely reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of the Company\u2019s assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock being offered. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock being offered. We cannot assure you that the Company will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of its preferred stock.\n1B.
