{"cik": "908937", "company": "SIRIUS XM HOLDINGS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information under the caption Item 1. Business \u201cCompetition,\u201d the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201cSpecial Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d following this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting our business.\nWe are monitoring and continue to assess the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses and operations. The scope of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic impact on our businesses depends on many factors beyond our control, and the effects are difficult to assess or predict with meaningful precision both generally and specifically as to our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses.\nWe have taken actions to help ensure the continuity of our audio entertainment service through the COVID-19 pandemic, including activating our business continuity plans and implementing other steps to enable employees to work remotely. The impact of these steps on our workforce has presented new challenges for our employees as they balance the demands of the pandemic with their daily operating responsibilities.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created various uncertainties in our business, including:\n\u2022Limits on our ability to fully staff our customer service operations and certain of our marketing efforts, particularly telemarketing,\n\u2022Changes to our sales and marketing practices as we react to shifts in the volume of auto sales and subscriber expectations, particularly in customer service and billing operations,\n\u2022Possible increases in bad debts as the pandemic broadly affects employment and consumer spending,\n\u2022The loss of sales and orders in our advertising business, particularly as industries that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic - such as the travel and travel-related industries - curtail and in many cases stop their advertising spending, and\n\u2022Other consequences in our marketing, sales and other operations which we have not yet identified.\nImportantly, the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on other third parties upon which we rely, and our ability to assess those effects in any meaningful manner are difficult at this time. In addition, a number of third parties upon which we depend may experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy protection. Such third parties may not be able to perform their obligations or may be relieved of their obligations to us as part of the bankruptcy process, which in either case could adversely affect our business.\nLastly, the negative impact on consumer spending in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic may, depending upon the severity, adversely affect several areas of our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses and may negatively impact our operating results.\nRisks Relating to our Business and Operations\nWe face substantial competition and that competition is likely to increase over time.\nWe compete for the time and attention of our listeners with other content providers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and perception of content quality, ease of use, price, accessibility, brand awareness, reputation and, in the case of our ad-supported Pandora service, perception of ad load, features and functionality. Our ability to attract and retain subscribers and listeners depends on our success in creating and providing popular or unique programming. A summary of certain services that compete with us is contained in the section entitled \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur subscribers and listeners can obtain similar content for free through terrestrial radio stations, YouTube and other internet services. We also compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other in-home and mobile entertainment services, and we compete for advertising sales with large scale online advertising platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, and with traditional media outlets.\nOur streaming services also compete for listeners on the basis of the presence and visibility of our apps, which are distributed via app stores operated by Apple and Google. We face significant competition for listeners from these companies, which also promote their own music and content. In addition, our competitors\u2019 streaming products may be pre-loaded or integrated into consumer electronics products or automobiles more broadly than our streaming products, creating a visibility advantage. If we are unable to compete successfully for listeners against other media providers, then our business may suffer. Additionally, the operator of an app store may reject our app or amend the terms of their license in a way that inhibits our ability to distribute our apps, negatively affects our business, or limits our ability to increase subscribers and listeners.\nCompetition could result in lower subscription, advertising or other revenue and an increase in our expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and free cash flow. We cannot assure you we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors or that competition will not have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nIf our efforts to attract and retain subscribers and listeners, or convert listeners into subscribers, are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to attract new subscribers and listeners and retain our current subscribers and listeners.\nOur ability to increase the number of subscribers and listeners to our services, retain our subscribers and listeners or convert listeners into subscribers, is uncertain and subject to many factors, including:\n\u2022the price of our service;\n\u2022the ease of use of our service;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing programs;\n\u2022with respect to our Sirius XM service, the sale or lease rate of new vehicles in the United States;\n\u2022the rate at which our self-pay subscribers to our Sirius XM service buy and sell new and used vehicles in the United States;\n\u2022our ability to convince owners and lessees of new and used vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to our Sirius XM service;\n\u2022the perceived value of our programming and the packages and services we offer;\n\u2022our ability to introduce features in a manner that is favorably received by consumers;\n\u2022our ability to keep up with rapidly evolving technology and features in audio entertainment;\n\u2022our ability to respond to evolving consumer tastes; and\n\u2022actions by our competitors, such as Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and other audio entertainment and information providers.\nWe engage in extensive marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts is an important part of our business.\nWe engage in extensive marketing efforts across a broad range of media to attract and retain subscribers and listeners to our services. We employ a wide variety of communications tools as part of our marketing campaigns, including telemarketing efforts and email solicitations. The effectiveness of our marketing efforts is affected by a broad range of factors, including creative and execution factors. Our ability to reach consumers with radio and television advertising, direct mail materials, email solicitations and telephone calls is an important part of our efforts and a significant factor in the effectiveness of our marketing. If we are unable to reach consumers through email solicitations or telemarketing, including as a result of \u201cspam\u201d and email filters, call blocking technologies or \"do-not-call\" or other marketing regulations, our marketing efforts will be adversely affected. A decline in the effectiveness of our marketing efforts could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties for the operation of our business, and the failure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends, in part, on various third parties, including:\n\u2022manufacturers that build and distribute satellite radios;\n\u2022companies that manufacture and sell integrated circuits for satellite radios;\n\u2022third-party software that we incorporate in and include with our apps and service;\n\u2022programming providers, including agreements with owners of various copyrights in music, and on-air talent;\n\u2022vendors that operate our call centers;\n\u2022vendors that have designed or built, and vendors that support or operate, other important elements of our systems, including our satellites and cloud-based systems we use;\n\u2022Apple, who distributes our apps through its App Store and who, in the case of our Pandora service, we rely on to collect fees and approve the terms of our consumer offers; and\n\u2022Google, who distributes our apps through its App Store and who, in the case of our Pandora service, we rely on to collect fees and approve the terms of our consumer offers, and who plays an important role in the fulfillment of the ads we sell on our Pandora platform.\nIf one or more of these third parties do not perform in a satisfactory or timely manner, including complying with our standards and practices relating to business integrity, personnel and cybersecurity, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe operation of our apps and service offerings could be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we use. It is difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control. Our third party licensors may not continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their software to maintain and enhance its capabilities, or remain in business. Failure of these third party licensors could harm our streaming services.\nIn addition, a number of third parties on which we depend have experienced, and may in the future experience, financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy protection. Such third parties may not be able to perform their obligations to us in a timely manner, if at all, as a result of their financial condition or may be relieved of their obligations to us as part of seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives.\nOur strategy includes selective acquisitions, other strategic investments and initiatives that allow us to expand our business. The success of any acquisition depends upon effective integration, cultural assimilation and management of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realizing the growth potential, the anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention for other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired business or assets.\nWe are devoting significant management attention and resources to integrate the businesses and operations of certain acquisitions. The integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nRisks Relating to our Sirius XM Business\nA substantial number of our Sirius XM service subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions and we cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers.\nAs part of our business, we experience, and expect to experience in the future, subscriber turnover (i.e., churn). If we are unable to retain current subscribers at expected rates, or the costs of retaining subscribers are higher than expected, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers who purchase or lease vehicles that include a subscription to our Sirius XM service. A substantial percentage of our Sirius XM subscribers are on discounted pricing plans and our ability to retain these subscribers or migrate them to higher priced plans is uncertain. Our discounted pricing strategy is widely known, and this may interfere with our ability to collect our ordinary subscription prices. In addition, a substantial number of those subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions when offered a subscription at a higher price.\nOur ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers to our Sirius XM service as our marketing efforts reach more price-sensitive consumers is uncertain.\nOur efforts to acquire subscribers purchasing or leasing used vehicles may attract price sensitive consumers. For example, consumers purchasing or leasing used vehicles may be more price sensitive than consumers purchasing or leasing new vehicles, may convert from trial subscribers to self-paying subscribers at a lower rate, and may cancel their subscriptions more frequently than consumers purchasing or leasing new vehicles. Some of our marketing efforts may also attract more price sensitive subscribers, and our efforts to increase the penetration of satellite radios in new, lower-priced vehicle lines may result in the growth of more economy-minded subscribers. In addition, over time the changing demographics of our subscriber base, such as the expected increase in \u201cMillennial generation customers,\u201d may increase the number of subscribers accustomed to consuming entertainment through ad-supported products. Each of these factors may harm our revenue or require additional spending on marketing efforts to demonstrate the value of our Sirius XM service.\nOur business depends in part upon the auto industry.\nA substantial portion of the subscription growth for our satellite radio service has come from purchasers and lessees of new and used automobiles in the United States, and we expect this to be an important source of subscribers for our satellite radio service in the future.\nWe have agreements with every major automaker to include satellite radios in new vehicles, although these agreements do not require automakers to install specific or minimum quantities of radios in any given period. Our business could be adversely affected if automakers do not continue to include our Sirius XM service in their products.\nAutomotive production and sales are dependent on many factors, including the availability of consumer credit, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and fuel costs. To the extent vehicle sales by automakers decline, or the penetration of factory-installed satellite radios in those vehicles is reduced, subscriber growth for our satellite radio service may be adversely impacted.\nSales of used vehicles represent a significant source of new subscribers for our satellite radio service. We have agreements with auto dealers and companies operating in the used vehicle market to provide us with data on sales of used satellite radio enabled vehicles, including in many cases the consumer\u2019s name and address. The continuing availability of this data is important to our future growth, and the loss of such data may harm our revenue and business.\nFailure of our satellites would significantly damage our business.\nThe lives of the satellites required to operate our Sirius XM service vary depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022degradation and durability of solar panels;\n\u2022quality of construction;\n\u2022random failure of satellite components, which could result in significant damage to or loss of a satellite;\n\u2022amount of fuel the satellite consumes; and\n\u2022damage or destruction as a result of electrostatic storms, terrorist attacks, collisions with other objects in space or other events, such as nuclear detonations, occurring in space.\nIn the ordinary course of operation, satellites experience failures of component parts and operational and performance anomalies. Components on several of our in-orbit satellites have failed, and from time to time we have experienced anomalies in the operation and performance of these satellites. These failures and anomalies are expected to continue in the ordinary course, and we cannot predict if any of these possible future events will have a material adverse effect on our operations or the life of our existing in-orbit satellites. In addition, our Sirius network of terrestrial repeaters communicates with a single third party satellite. Our XM network of terrestrial repeaters communicates with a single XM satellite. If the satellites communicating with the applicable repeater network fail unexpectedly, the services would be disrupted for several hours or longer.\nOn December 13, 2020, our SXM-7 satellite was successfully launched. In-orbit testing of SXM-7 began on January 4, 2021. During in-orbit testing of SXM-7, events occurred which have caused failures of certain SXM-7 payload units. An evaluation of SXM-7 is underway. The full extent of the damage to SXM-7 is not yet known. We have purchased insurance policies covering SXM-7 through launch and the first year of in-orbit operation. The aggregate coverage under those insurance policies is $225 million. We have notified the underwriters of these policies of a potential claim with respect to SXM-7.\nAny material failure of our operating satellites could cause us to lose customers for our Sirius XM service and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results. With the exception of the insurance we have purchased covering the launch and the first year of in-orbit operation of SXM-7 and SXM-8, we do not have insurance for our in-orbit satellites. Additional information regarding our fleet of satellites is contained in the section entitled \u201cItem 1. Business - Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Sirius XM service may experience harmful interference from wireless operations.\nThe development of applications and services in spectrum adjacent to the frequencies licensed to us, as well as the combination of signals in other frequencies, may cause harmful interference to our satellite radio service in certain areas of the United States. Certain operations or combination of operations permitted by the FCC in spectrum, other than our licensed frequencies, results in the loss of signal to our service, and the reception of our satellite radio service can be adversely affected in certain areas. Elimination of this interference may not be possible in all cases. In other cases, our efforts to reduce this interference may require extensive engineering efforts and additions to our terrestrial infrastructure. These mitigation efforts may be costly and take several years to implement and may not be entirely effective. In certain cases, we are dependent on the FCC to assist us in preventing harmful interference to our service.\nRisks Relating to our Pandora Business\nOur Pandora ad-supported business has suffered a substantial and consistent loss of monthly active users, which may adversely affect our Pandora business.\nThe number of monthly active users to our ad-supported Pandora business has declined consistently for several years, and may further contract in the future.\nThe size of our ad-supported listener base is an important element of our Pandora business. The decline in our listener base has resulted in fewer listener hours and available advertising spots on our Pandora service, which ultimately may result in declines in our advertising revenue, and adversely affect our Pandora business. The contraction of our ad-supported listener base also decreases the size of demographic groups targeted by advertisers, which may hurt our ability to deliver advertising in a manner that maximizes advertisers\u2019 return on investment and compete with other digital advertising platforms.\nOur failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Pandora ad-supported service could harm our business.\nWe derive substantial revenue on our Pandora service from the sale of advertising. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and ultimately to sell our advertising inventory, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the number of listener hours on the Pandora ad-supported service, particularly the number of listener hours attributable to high-value demographics;\n\u2022keeping pace with changes in technology and our competitors, some of which have significant influence over the distribution of our Pandora app;\n\u2022competing effectively for advertising with other dominant online services, such as Spotify, Google and Facebook, as well as other marketing and media outlets, some of which provide services to us that we depend upon to fulfill the advertising we sell;\n\u2022successfully competing for local radio advertising;\n\u2022demonstrating the ability of advertisements to reach targeted audiences, including the value of mobile digital advertising;\n\u2022ensuring that new ad formats and ad product offerings are attractive to advertisers and that inventory management decisions (such as changes to ad load, frequency, prominence and quality of ads that we serve listeners) do not have a negative impact on listener hours; and\n\u2022adapting to technologies designed to block the display of our ads.\nOur agreements with advertisers are generally short-term and may be terminated at any time by the advertiser. Advertisers may leave us for competing alternatives at any time. Failure to demonstrate to advertisers the value of our Pandora service would result in reduced spending by, or loss of, advertisers, which would harm our revenue and business.\nIf we are unable to maintain revenue growth from our advertising products, particularly in mobile advertising, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn order to effectively monetize listener hours, we must, among other things, convince advertisers to migrate spending to nascent advertising markets, penetrate local advertising markets and develop compelling ad product solutions.\nThe substantial majority of the total listening to our Pandora service occurs on mobile devices. We are engaged in efforts to continue to convince advertisers of the capabilities and value of mobile digital advertising and to direct an increasing portion of their advertising spend to our ad-supported Pandora service.\nWe are continuing to build our sales capability to penetrate local advertising markets, which places us in competition with terrestrial radio. We may not be able to capture an increasing share of local and audio advertising revenue, which may have an adverse impact on our future revenue.\nChanges to mobile operating systems and browsers may hinder our ability to sell advertising and market our services.\nWe use shared common device identifiers that are universal in the advertising technology ecosystem, such as Apple\u2019s Identifier for Advertisers, a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user's device. We use these common device identifiers for targeting, advertising effectiveness and measurement for the Pandora\u2019s advertising business and for Pandora\u2019s consumer marketing purposes. These common device identifiers enable us to match audiences, including with second- and third-party data providers and measurement vendors, and enhance Pandora\u2019s advertising targeting segments with additional data. In our programmatic advertising business, we use common identifiers for several important functions, such as targeting and bidding. We also use common device identifiers to evaluate the success of our Pandora brand consumer marketing campaigns.\nApple, as well as mobile operating system and browser providers, have announced product features and plans that may adversely impact our ability to use these common identifiers and data collected in connection with these common identifiers in our Pandora business.\nIf we fail to accurately predict and play music, comedy or other content that our Pandora listeners enjoy, we may fail to retain existing and attract new listeners.\nA key differentiating factor between our Pandora service and other music content providers is our ability to predict music that our listeners will enjoy. The effectiveness of our personalized playlist generating system depends, in part, on our ability to gather and effectively analyze large amounts of listener data and feedback. We have no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enticing listeners to our Pandora service to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to enough songs to effectively predict and select new and existing songs. In addition, our ability to offer listeners songs that they have not previously heard and impart a sense of discovery depends on our ability to acquire and appropriately categorize additional tracks that will appeal to our listeners\u2019 diverse and changing tastes. Many of our competitors currently have larger music and content catalogs than we offer and they may be more effective in providing their listeners with an appealing listener experience.\nWe also provide comedy and podcast content on our Pandora service, and we try to predict what our listeners will enjoy using technology similar to the technology that we use to generate personalized playlists for music. The risks that apply to our ability to satisfy our listeners\u2019 musical tastes apply to comedy, podcasts and other content to an even greater extent, particularly since we do not yet have as large a data set on listener preferences for comedy, podcasts and other content, and have a smaller catalog of such content as compared to music.\nOur ability to predict and select music, comedy, podcasts and other content that our listeners enjoy is important to the perceived value of our Pandora service to consumers and the failure to make accurate predictions would adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers and listeners, increase listener hours and sell advertising.\nRisks Relating to Laws and Governmental Regulations\nPrivacy and data security laws and regulations may hinder our ability to market our services, sell advertising and impose legal liabilities.\nWe receive a substantial amount of data on purchasers and lessees of new and used vehicles from third parties. We use this data to market our services. We collect and use demographic and other information, including location information, from and about our listeners through the internet. Further, we and third parties use tracking technologies, including \u201ccookies\u201d and related technologies, to help us manage and track our listeners\u2019 interactions with our services and deliver relevant advertising.\nVarious federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions, govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of the data we receive. Privacy groups and government authorities have increasingly scrutinized the ways in which companies collect and share data, including linking personal identities and data associated with particular users or devices with data collected through the internet, and we expect such scrutiny to increase. Alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data may expose us to potential liability, may require us to expend significant resources in responding to and defending such allegations and claims and could in the future result in negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our subscribers, listeners and advertisers.\nPrivacy-related laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation, are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies as well as foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy and data security-related matters. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and contractual obligations, as well as changes in our listeners\u2019 expectations and demands regarding privacy and data security, may limit our ability to collect and use consumer data. Restrictions on our ability to collect, access and harness listener data, or to use or disclose listener data or profiles that we develop using such data, could limit our ability to deliver personalized content to our listeners and offer targeted advertising opportunities to our advertising customers, each of which are important to the success of our business. Increased regulation of data utilization and distribution practices could increase our costs of operation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nConsumer protection laws and our failure to comply with them could damage our business.\nFederal and state consumer protection laws, rules and regulations cover nearly all aspects of our marketing efforts, including the content of our advertising, the terms of consumer offers and the manner in which we communicate with consumers. The nature of our business requires us to expend significant resources to try to ensure that our marketing activities comply with consumer protection laws, including laws relating to telemarketing activities and privacy. These efforts may not be successful, and we may have to expend even greater resources in our compliance efforts.\nModifications to consumer protection laws, including decisions by courts and administrative agencies interpreting these laws, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain subscribers and listeners to our services. There can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not be enacted or adopted, preexisting laws or regulations will not be more strictly enforced or that our operations will comply with all applicable laws, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business.\nWe hold FCC licenses and authorizations to operate commercial satellite radio services in the United States, including satellites, terrestrial repeaters and related authorizations. The FCC generally grants licenses and authorizations for a fixed term. Although we expect our licenses and authorizations to be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Any assignment or transfer of control of any of our FCC licenses or authorizations must be approved in advance by the FCC.\nThe operation of our satellite radio systems is subject to significant regulation by the FCC under authority granted through the Communications Act of 1934 and related federal law. We are required, among other things, to operate only within specified frequencies; to coordinate our satellite radio services with radio systems operating in the same range of frequencies in neighboring countries; and to coordinate our communications links to our satellites with other systems that operate in the same frequency band.\nNoncompliance by us with these requirements or other conditions or with other applicable FCC rules and regulations could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other detrimental FCC actions. There is no guarantee that Congress will not modify the statutory framework governing our services, or that the FCC will not modify its rules and regulations in a manner that would have an adverse impact on our operations.\nRisks Associated with Data and Cybersecurity and the Protection of Consumer Information\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our subscribers and listeners including, in many cases, credit and debit card information. We have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to data pertaining to our customers, including credit card and debit card information and other personally identifiable information. Our services, which are supported by our own systems and those of third-party vendors, are vulnerable to computer malware and attacks, any of which could lead to system interruptions, delays, or shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers or if an actual or perceived breach of security occurs on our systems or a vendor\u2019s systems, we could be exposed to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer. We may also be required to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under various data privacy regulations, and our reputation and operating results could suffer. In addition, our subscribers and listeners, as well as potential customers, could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue the use of our services. This loss of confidence would also harm our efforts to attract and retain advertisers, and unauthorized access to our programming would potentially create additional royalty expense with no corresponding revenue. Such events could adversely affect our results of operations. The costs of maintaining adequate protection, including insurance protection, against such threats as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) could be material.\nIn addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors or other agents. We may not be able to effectively control the unauthorized actions of third parties who may have access to the data we collect.\nWe may integrate the Pandora service with apps provided by third parties. In such case, we may not be able to control such third parties\u2019 use of listeners\u2019 data, ensure their compliance with the terms of our privacy policies, or prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, information, any of which could expose us to potential liability and negative publicity and could cause our listeners and advertisers to discontinue use of our services.\nTo date, we have not had a significant cyber-attack or breach that has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. We have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive, confidential and personal data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. Additionally, we have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and timely response to potential security anomalies.\nThe cyber security measures we have implemented, however, may not be sufficient to prevent all possible attacks and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. Further, the development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.\nWe rely on systems housed at our own premises and at those of third party vendors to enable subscribers and listeners to access our Pandora and Sirius XM services in a dependable and efficient manner. Any degradation in the quality, or any failure, of our systems could reduce our revenues, cause us to lose customers and damage our brands. Although we have implemented practices designed to maintain the availability of the information technology systems we rely on and mitigate the harm of any unplanned interruptions, we cannot anticipate all eventualities. We occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. We could also experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which could cause us to lose customers and could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and service providers to take, fulfill and handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us from servicing customers or cause data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our services have\nexperienced, and we expect them to continue to experience, periodic service interruptions and delays involving our own systems and those of our third-party vendors.\nOur data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our services and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained on our systems and that these third party vendors store and deliver on our behalf.\nDamage or interruption to our data centers and information technology and communications centers could expose us to data loss or manipulation, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages, competitive disadvantage and significant increases in compliance costs and costs to improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could also subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under evolving cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by the U.S. federal and state governments or other foreign jurisdictions or by various regulatory organizations. As a result, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations might be adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with Certain Intellectual Property Rights\nThe market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe must maintain music programming royalty arrangements with, and pay license fees to, owners of rights in musical works in order to operate our services. Traditionally, BMI, ASCAP and SESAC have negotiated for these copyright users, collected royalties and distributed them to songwriters and music publishers. These traditional arrangements are changing. The fracturing of the traditional system for licensing rights in musical works may have significant consequences to our business, including increasing licensing costs and reducing the availability of certain pieces for use on our services.\nUnder the United States Copyright Act, we also must pay royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings for the performance of such sound recordings on our Sirius XM service. Those royalty rates may be established through negotiation or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, by the Copyright Royalty Board. Owners of copyrights in sound recordings have created SoundExchange, a collective organization, to collect and distribute royalties. SoundExchange is exempt by statute from certain U.S. antitrust laws and exercises significant market power in the licensing of sound recordings. Under the terms of the Copyright Royalty Board\u2019s existing decision governing sound recording royalties for satellite radio, we are required to pay a royalty based on our gross revenues associated with our satellite radio service, subject to certain exclusions, of 15.5% per year for each of the next seven years.\nOur Pandora services depend upon maintaining complex licenses with copyright owners, and these licenses contain onerous terms.\nPandora has direct license agreements with many sound recording copyright and musical work copyright owners. These agreements grant us the right to operate Pandora Premium, and add interactive features, such as replays, additional skips and offline play, to Pandora\u2019s ad-supported service and to Pandora Plus.\nThe economic terms of these direct licenses are onerous and, as a result, we may not be able to profitably operate the Pandora services. However, the economic terms of these direct licenses may be \u201cmarket,\u201d given the rates paid by Pandora\u2019s competitors. Competition for Pandora\u2019s services are primarily offered by entities that provide music and entertainment services as a small part of a larger business, such as Apple, Google and Amazon. These competitors have the ability to bear these onerous economic provisions to a much greater extent than our Pandora business. We may not be able to negotiate or obtain lower royalty rates under these direct licenses.\nThese direct licenses are complex. We may not be in compliance with the terms of these licenses, which could result in the loss of some or all of these licenses and some or all of the rights they convey. Similarly, many of these licenses provide that if the licensor loses rights in a portion of the content licensed under the agreement, that content may be removed from the license going-forward.\nIf Pandora fails to maintain these direct licenses, or if rights to certain music were no longer available under these licenses, then we may have to remove the affected music from Pandora\u2019s services, or discontinue certain interactive features for such music, and it might become commercially impractical for us to operate Pandora Premium, Pandora Plus or certain features of our advertising supported service. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral of these direct licenses also include provisions related to the terms of those agreements relative to other content licensing arrangements, which are commonly referred to as \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clauses. These provisions have caused, and may in the future cause, our payments under those agreements to escalate substantially. In addition, many record labels, music publishers and performing rights organizations have the right to audit our royalty payments, and audits often result in disputes over whether we have paid the proper amounts. As a result of such audits, we could be required to pay additional amounts, audit fees and interest or penalties, and the amounts involved could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no guarantee that these direct licenses will be renewed in the future or that such licenses will be available on the economic terms associated with the current licenses. If we are unable to secure and maintain direct licenses for the rights to provide music on our Pandora services on terms similar to those under our current direct licenses, our content costs could rise and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rates we must pay for \u201cmechanical rights\u201d to use musical works on our Pandora service have increased substantially and these rates may adversely affect our business.\nPandora has direct licenses with thousands of music publishers. Those licenses provide that the royalty rate for \u201creproduction rights\u201d or \u201cmechanical rights\u201d, which are required to offer the interactive features of our Pandora services, are determined by the rate formula set by the Copyright Royalty Board for the compulsory license made available by Section 115 of the Copyright Act. These royalty rates also apply to Pandora\u2019s use of musical works for which we do not have a direct license with the copyright owners.\nThe Copyright Royalty Board has issued a rate formula for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022. Pursuant to that decision, the rate that we expected to pay to music publishers and songwriters for the mechanical rights and performance rights needed in connection with interactive streaming would have increased annually between 2018 and 2022. On August 11, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the CRB failed to provide adequate notice of the rate structure it adopted, failed to explain its rejection of a past settlement agreement as a benchmark for going forward, and never identified the source of its asserted authority to substantively redefine a material term of its initial determination. For these reasons, the Court of Appeals overturned the CRB\u2019s adopted rate structure and percentage rates and remanded the proceeding to the CRB for further proceedings. The CRB has announced further proceedings to consider and address the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\nOur use of pre-1972 sound recordings on our Pandora service could result in additional costs.\nFederal copyright protection previously did not apply to sound recordings created prior to February 15, 1972. The protection of such recordings was instead governed by a patchwork of state statutory and common laws. Copyright owners of pre-1972 sound recordings have brought litigation against Pandora alleging violations of state statutory and common laws arising from the reproduction and public performance of pre-1972 sound recordings.\nIf Pandora is found liable for the violation of the exclusive rights of any pre-1972 sound recording copyright owners, then we could be subject to liability, the amount of which could be significant.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or actions by third parties to enforce their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nDevelopment of our systems has depended upon the intellectual property that we have developed, as well as intellectual property licensed from third parties. If the intellectual property that we have developed or use is not adequately protected, others will be permitted to and may duplicate portions of our systems or services without liability. In addition, others may challenge, invalidate, render unenforceable or circumvent our intellectual property rights, patents or existing licenses or we may face significant legal costs in connection with defending and enforcing those intellectual property rights. Some of the know-how and technology we have developed, and plan to develop, is not now, nor will it be, covered by U.S. patents or trade secret protections. Trade secret protection and contractual agreements may not provide adequate protection if there is any unauthorized use or disclosure. The loss of necessary technologies could require us to substitute technologies of lower quality performance standards, at greater cost or on a delayed basis, which could harm us.\nOther parties may have patents or pending patent applications, which will later mature into patents or inventions that may block or put limits on our ability to operate our system or license our technologies. We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our rights under license agreements or to determine the scope and validity of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights in the subject matter of those licenses. This may be expensive and we may not succeed in any such litigation.\nThird parties may assert claims or bring suit against us for patent, trademark or copyright infringement, or for other infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be costly, divert our efforts from our business, subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, block our ability to operate our services or license our technology, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market our services.\nSome of our services and technologies may use \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code subject to those licenses.\nWe may incorporate in some products software licensed under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Open source licenses often require that the source code be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to the open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we may be required to publicly release portions of our source code, be forced to re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business.\nRapid technological and industry changes and new entrants could adversely impact our services.\nThe audio entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and feature innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, evolving standards and new entrants offering products and services. If we are unable to keep pace with these changes, our business may not succeed. Products using new technologies could make our services less competitive in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to our Capital and Ownership Structure\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our debt contains certain covenants that restrict our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $8.5 billion of indebtedness outstanding.\nOur indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, marketing and other general corporate activities; limits our ability to borrow additional funds; and may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the audio entertainment industry.\nIn addition, our borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility carry a variable interest rate based on London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority the \"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules. As such, we have elected not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Although a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors, we do not have a compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee that consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nWhile we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time.\nWe currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, although we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after considering various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, limitations imposed by our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur principal stockholder has significant influence, including over actions requiring stockholder approval, and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Liberty Media beneficially owned approximately 76% of Holdings\u2019 common stock and has the ability to influence our affairs, policies and operations. One Liberty Media executive, one Liberty Media senior advisor, and one other member of the board of directors of Liberty Media are members of our board of directors. Our board of directors currently has fourteen members. Gregory B. Maffei, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Media, is the Chairman of Holdings\u2019 board of directors. Our board of directors is responsible for, among other things, the appointment of executive management, future issuances of common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, the incurrence of debt, and the approval of various transactions.\nLiberty Media can also determine the outcome of all matters requiring general stockholder approval, including the election of the board of directors and changes to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Liberty Media can also cause or prevent a change of control of Holdings and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The concentration of ownership could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. In certain cases, the interests of Liberty Media may not be aligned with the interests of other stockholders of Holdings.\nOther Operational Risks\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, sales, technical and other personnel. All of our employees, including our executive officers, are free to terminate their employment with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business may be difficult to replace.\nQualified individuals are in high demand, particularly in the media and technology industries in New York and in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have substantial operations, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees. If we are unable to attract and retain our key employees, we may not be able to achieve our objectives, and our business could be harmed.\nOur facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities.\nAn earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, civil unrest or other catastrophic event could damage our data centers, studios, terrestrial repeater networks or satellite uplink facilities, interrupt our services and harm our business. We also have significant operations in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity.\nAny damage to the satellites that transmit to our terrestrial repeater networks would likely result in degradation of the affected service for some Sirius XM subscribers and could result in complete loss of Sirius XM satellite service in certain or all areas. Damage to our satellite uplink facilities could result in a complete loss of our Sirius XM satellite service until we could transfer operations to suitable back-up facilities.\nThe unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nWe are parties to several legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of our business, including class actions arising out of our marketing practices. The outcome of these proceedings may not be favorable, and one or more unfavorable outcomes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities that other entertainment service providers would not customarily be subject to.\nWe design, establish specifications, source or specify parts and components, and manage various aspects of the logistics of the production of satellite radios and our apps. As a result of these activities, we may be exposed to liabilities associated with the design, manufacture and distribution of radios that the providers of an entertainment service would not customarily be subject to, such as liabilities for design defects, patent infringement and compliance with applicable laws, as well as the costs of returned product.\nOur business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands is an important part of our strategy to expand our base of subscribers, listeners and advertisers. Our brands may be impaired by a number of factors, including service outages, data privacy and security issues and exploitation of our trademarks by others without permission. Our ability to maintain and enhance our brands also depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and provide an innovative and high-quality entertainment experience, which we may not do successfully.\nSpecial Note About Forward-Looking Statements\nWe have made various statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
