{"cik": "1084752", "company": "Inventergy Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or obtain the necessary financing we need to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. We plan to continue to provide for our capital requirements that are not met by income from our operations by issuing additional equity or debt. No assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us. We also cannot give assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability and cash flow positive operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan or to generate positive operating results. Our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that these matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity will only be sufficient to fund our business activities through June 2017. If the Company cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic development plan, its liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected, and the Company may have to cease operations.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and our inability to execute on our current business plan may adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nWe have generated only modest revenues to date. We not only have a limited operating history, but also a limited track record in executing our business model which includes, among other things, acquiring, licensing, litigating or otherwise monetizing our patent assets. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects.\nIn light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with a limited operating history in the early stages of development, there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, or demonstrate that our business plan is sound; and/or\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to fund acquisitions of additional patent portfolios or the costs of litigation or otherwise to effectuate our long-term business plan.\nOur inability to execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters may adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nWe have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and have relied on external financing to support our operations. Our failure to generate sufficient revenue from operations or obtain additional financing will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSince inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations and have accumulated a deficit. We will need to generate revenue from operations or will require additional equity and/or debt financing to fund our ongoing activities. There are no assurances that additional financing will be available to us at a cost acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient revenue from operations or obtain additional financing will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, additional financing may dilute our stockholders.\nAssuming certain payables are deferred and expenses are managed efficiently, we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to conduct our planned operations for approximately three months. We may need significant additional capital to generate revenues from our Inventergy Innovations partnerships. Based on our updated internal financial plan covering the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, we anticipate that we will require additional capital for operating expenses of approximately $4.1 million for the next twelve months, consisting of approximately $2.3 million in personnel related costs (including costs related to third party consultants performing outsourced functions), $0.5 million in facilities and infrastructure costs and $1.3 million in other operational costs.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital through, among other things, public and private equity offerings and debt financings, including through takedowns from our shelf registration statement on Form S-3. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our levels of net revenues from Inventergy Innovations activities and patent monetization revenues from the PRIP. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization which could impact our business operations.\nIf adequate working capital is not available when needed, we may be required to significantly modify our business model and operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level. It could cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. It may also cause us to reduce or cease operations altogether.\nUnder the PRIP, the Patents that we acquired from Huawei, Nokia or Panasonic may not be successfully monetized which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Patents that we are transferring to INVT SPE under the PRIP will be successfully monetized. Failure to successfully monetize these patent assets to a level that would yield positive results to the Company would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, patent monetization activity is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 The out-licensing of a patent portfolio is a time consuming and expensive process. If efforts to do so under the PRIP are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, anticipated licensing results may not be achieved.\n\u00b7 If a patent infringement suit is initiated against potential infringers or potential licensees initiate a declaratory judgment action or administrative review action against INVT SPE, such potential infringers and/or licensees may successfully invalidate the Patents or a fact finder may find that the potential infringer\u2019s products do not infringe the Patents. Thus, monetization of the Patents under the PRIP may not be successful. These activities are inherently risky, time consuming and costly.\n\u00b7 We have, to date, entered into only two licensing arrangements and one patent sale. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Patents will be successfully monetized under the PRIP.\nThe Managing Member may choose not to actively pursue patent monetization efforts, including litigation, or may choose to discontinue such efforts at any time.\nPursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, the Managing Member has the sole discretion whether to pursue monetization activities, including litigation, for the Patents. As such, we are reliant on the Managing Member\u2019s efforts to pursue such activities and, in the event the Managing Member chooses not to fully implement monetization efforts or chooses to discontinue such efforts at any time in the future, we may not see any revenue from the PRIP. In addition, under the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, any revenues obtained will be distributed as discussed in Item 1. Business. If the Managing Member does not actively pursue monetization efforts for the Patents, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our business and operating results.\nIf Congress, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) or courts implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect the PRIP. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively impact revenues from the PRIP and our Inventergy Innovations initiatives.\nIn addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAIA\u201d) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to the United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. As the regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, especially the contested cases provisions (Inter-Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) and Post-Grant Review (\u201cPGR\u201d)) were only recently fully effective, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patents acquired by us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe United States government has placed restrictions on NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Commerce and Justice departments from buying information technology (in particular from Huawei) that has been \u201cproduced, manufactured or assembled\u201d by companies with ties to the Chinese government unless the FBI or a similar agency first determines the purchase would be in the U.S. national interest. We believe these restrictions impose no limitations on the Managing Member\u2019s ability to license or enforce the Patents that we purchased from Huawei. Because we understand these restrictions apply solely to purchases of actual hardware and equipment, we believe the patent assets and rights which we have purchased from Huawei, with respect to those restrictions, include valid rights within the geographical United States which remain enforceable against all potential infringers. However, the United States government may try to apply other restrictions to prohibit its departments from licensing Huawei-related intellectual property rights, in which case the Managing Member may be unable to consensually license patent assets purchased from Huawei to the U.S. government. Such interpretation of the prohibition, and other changes in United States law, regulation or practice as it relates to the license or enforcement of patent assets acquired from Huawei, could result in a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nNew legislation has been introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate, seeking to curb so-called \u201cLitigation Abuses.\u201d These bills include potential provisions for, among other things, expanded pleading requirements for patent litigations, patent-specific discovery and case management rules, disclosure obligations for parties having a financial interest in a patent case, certain provisions regarding so-called \u201ccustomer suits\u201d in favor of manufacturers. These bills have not yet been voted upon or amended and it is uncertain what, if any, new legislation will issue from the United States Congress, and what if any impact such legislation would have on our business and operations.\nFurthermore, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages that a patent licensing company such as INVT SPE might be entitled to. Any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines.\nIn September 2013, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it is planning to gather information from approximately 25 companies that are in the business of buying and asserting patents in order to develop a better understanding of how those companies do business and impact innovation and competition. Both the Federal Trade Commission and European Commission are actively considering what the appropriate restrictions are on the ability of owners of patents declared to technical standards to receive both injunctions and royalties.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurther, the leadership changes in the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) make it challenging to predict whether and how the EC will shift its focus from its prior stances regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the relationship between such rights and European competition law.\nAdditionally, there are numerous initiatives being pursued in multiple countries including India and Brazil, regarding when and how intellectual property rights should be enforced as well as the relationship between enforcement and other laws, including relevant anti-trust or competition law. It is too early to state with any degree of certainty the impact that such initiatives may have on our business.\nAdditionally, the political and legal climate in China appears to have changed and may cause significant challenges for foreign companies that attempt to enforce their intellectual property rights against Chinese business whether such rights are enforced in China or elsewhere in the world. At this time, it is unclear what if any impact this change in climate will have on our business.\nFurther, and in general, it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory developments and pending litigation in the industry may render our business model less profitable and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRecent regulatory developments, as well as pending litigation in the industry that is continuing to establish new laws and rules for the licensing and/or assertion of patents, may make this business model more difficult to execute, more risky and/or less profitable. As noted, new draft legislation proposed in Congress, if passed, might place more significant hurdles to the enforcement of our patent rights, allow defendants increased opportunities to challenge our patents in court and in the USPTO, introduce potentially expanded fee shifting for prevailing parties in litigation, and increase the risks and costs of patent litigation for all parties, including us. These changes and risks could decrease the value of our intellectual property portfolio, as well as increase the risk of unlicensed infringement of such portfolio.\nIn addition, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages a patent licensing company such as we might be entitled to. While we reject many of these arguments as improperly limiting the rights granted to legitimate patent holders under the Constitution and US patent laws, any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines that could make our patent portfolios less valuable or more costly to enforce. In addition, competition authorities in various countries and regions, as well as judicial actions in the United States and abroad are examining the rights and obligations of holders of standards essential patents (SEPs), and in some cases imposing restrictions and further obligations on the licensing and enforcement of SEPs. These changes in law and/or regulation may make our licensing programs more difficult, may render some or all SEP patents unenforceable, or impose other restrictions, costs, impediments or harm to the Patents.\nAny legal proceedings which the Managing Member may commence under the PRIP will likely be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nTo license or otherwise monetize the Patents that we have an interest in as part of the PRIP, we previously commenced legal proceedings against companies in which we alleged that such companies infringed on one or more of the Patents. In addition, the Managing Member may decide to commence litigation against other companies that it believes are infringing the Patents. As with all litigation, there is a risk that the Managing Member may be unable to achieve the results it desires from such litigation, failure from which would harm our business to a great degree.\nLegal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, the Managing Member may be forced to litigate against other parties in addition to the originally named defendants. Such adversaries may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims for, among other things, revocation of the Patents or file collateral litigations or initiate investigations in the United States or elsewhere in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such actions are successful, they may preclude the ability to derive licensing revenue from the Patents.\nAdditionally, legal fees and other expenses will likely be material and may negatively impact the Managing Member\u2019s willingness to enforce the Patents. Expenses thereafter are dependent on the outcome of the status of the litigation.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies and, as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. We cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions that may be made by juries and trial courts. Further, should we or the Managing Member be deemed the losing party in certain of these litigations, we or the Managing Member may be liable for some or all of the opponents\u2019 legal fees.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded and, as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nPatent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over patent enforcement actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAny failure to maintain or protect the Patents under the PRIP could adversely impact future Monetization Revenues under the PRIP.\nFuture Monetization Revenues under the PRIP largely depend on the superiority and value of the Patents under the PRIP. To protect such proprietary rights, a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and other protective contractual provisions are utilized. No assurances can be given that any of the measures that are undertaken to protect and maintain the Patents will have any measure of success.\nAlso, the Managing Member may not be able to effectively protect intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries from which potential licensees or infringers of the Patents may operate. If the Managing Member is unable to maintain, defend or prosecute the Patents properly, the value of the Patents would be reduced or eliminated, and future Monetization Revenues could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our other intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to operate our Inventergy Innovations business and compete in the intellectual property market largely depends on the superiority and value of our partners\u2019 intellectual property. To protect these proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties and other protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures that are undertaken to protect this intellectual property will have any measure of success.\nDespite the efforts of us and our partners to protect these intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of such intellectual property:\n\u00b7 applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7 issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide any commercially viable claims against potentially infringing parties;\n\u00b7 efforts to protect such intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of IP assets; or\n\u00b7 efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those covered by our or our partners\u2019 IP.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, or those of our partners, in certain foreign countries from which potential licensees or infringers may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute such IP rights properly, the value of such assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nOur confidential information may be disclosed by other parties.\nWe routinely enter into non-disclosure agreements with other parties, including but not limited to, vendors, law firms, parties with whom we are engaged in negotiations, and employees. However, there exists a risk that those other parties will not honor their contractual obligations to not disclose our confidential information. This may include parties who breach such obligations in the context of confidential settlement offers and/or negotiations. In addition, there exists a risk that, upon such breach and subsequent dissemination of our confidential information, third parties and potential licensees may seek to use such confidential information to their advantage and/or to our disadvantage including in legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our ability to act against such third parties may be limited, as we may not be in privity of contract with such third parties.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into licensing agreements which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the economies of many countries are presently experiencing weak economic conditions. Such uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties infringing on the Patents to enter into licensing or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to the PRIP, and any failure to do so could cause material harm to our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes and our failure to do so could make us less competitive which would adversely affect our prospects.\nThe markets addressed by the Patents and by third parties working with Inventergy Innovations are characterized by rapid change and technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards. Products using new technologies or emerging industry standards could make the Patents less attractive or applicable. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on timely enforcement of the Patents under the PRIP and Inventergy Innovations\u2019 ability to market our partners\u2019 intellectual property in a timely manner in light of technological advances and evolving industry standards and changing preferences.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our key personnel and our ability to hire additional qualified personnel and our inability to attract, retain or hire personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. Additionally, we do not currently carry a key-man insurance policy. Although we have entered into letter agreements with our current employees, each employee serves as an \u201cat will\u201d employee whose employment is terminable at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our anticipated growth will require us to recruit, hire and retain a number of new managerial, technical, operating and marketing personnel. The inability to retain, recruit and hire necessary personnel or the emergence of unexpected expansion difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing personnel or identify or hire additional personnel.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in a growing business enterprise and there is no assurance that we will be successful.\nThe likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties and complications of an early stage company. Our ability or inability to maintain current and potential clients, form new business relationships and partnerships, execute licensing programs, meet competition, and comply with applicable governmental regulations will also impact our growth and profitability.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may be unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors outside our control which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which will make period to period comparisons difficult. Generally, the timing and success of any IP licensing and litigation efforts will be unpredictable and intermittent rather than steady, and can be expected to continue to be unpredictable. The primary factors that may affect our revenues and operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the length and variability of the cycle for licensing the technology;\n\u00b7 the random timing of the outcome of any litigation INVT SPE may commence and the unpredictability of the success of such litigation; and\n\u00b7 the quality and degree of execution of our Inventergy Innovations business strategy and operating plan, and the effectiveness of Inventergy Innovations sales and licensing programs;\nIt can be difficult for us to predict the timing of deal closure under our Inventergy Innovations business, or the timing of receipt of revenues, if any, under the PRIP. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term and a delay in an anticipated license past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. Therefore, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will be a poor indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of the common stock could decline substantially.\nIf revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we would likely be unable to reduce costs and expenses proportionally for that quarter. Any such revenue shortfall would, therefore, have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter.\nRisks Related to the Telecommunications Industry\nIf the products or services that are marketed or sold by potential infringers of the Patents do not maintain market acceptance, the ability to license the Patents may be limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain segments of the telecommunications industry are dependent on developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs. We cannot assure you that the Patents that may be used in current or future products and services will gain or obtain increased market acceptance. The development of new or enhanced technologies could result in a loss of actual or potential market share by businesses utilizing the Patents which may limit the ability to monetize the Patents.\nThe regulatory framework and future changes in regulatory requirements under which telecommunications companies operate could require substantial time and resources for compliance by our licensees which could make it more difficult and costly to monetize the Patents.\nIn providing certain interstate and international telecommunications services, telecommunications companies must comply, or cause its customers or carriers to comply, with applicable telecommunications laws and regulations prescribed by the FCC and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. In offering services on an intrastate basis, such companies may also be subject to state laws and to regulation by state public utility commissions. International services may also be subject to regulation by foreign authorities and, in some markets, multinational authorities, such as the European Union. The costs of compliance with these regulations, including legal, operational and administrative expenses, can be expected to be substantial, and efforts and costs spent by potential licensees for these efforts may impede licensing negotiations, and could make it more difficult and costly to monetize the Patents.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, from January 1, 2015 through March 27, 2017, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $49.80 and $0.33 per share (amounts restated to reflect to a 1:10 reverse stock split which was effected on December 8, 2015). A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\u00b7 quarter to quarter variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 day traders;\n\u00b7 adverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u00b7 market conditions within our industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nWe have received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq and there is no assurance that our common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our common stock, the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted.\nOn November 21, 2016, we received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, because the closing bid price for our common stock has fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nPursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until May 22, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to May 22, 2017.\nIf we do not regain compliance by May 22, 2017, we may be eligible for an additional grace period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will grant an additional 180 calendar days for the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If the Nasdaq staff determines that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would have the right to appeal a determination to delist its common stock, and the common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market until the completion of the appeal process.\nIf Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on the OTCQB or the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d If this occurs, we could face material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOther than a special cash dividend that we declared with respect to our common stock on June 9, 2014 in connection with the merger of Inventergy, Inc. into our wholly owned subsidiary, or the Merger, we have not declared any cash dividend to date and we do not anticipate declaring any further cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. For the time being, we intend to retain future earnings for use in the development of our business.\nThe application of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock is trading at less than $5.00 per share. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, our common stock would become subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nOur stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership may become diluted upon conversion of our preferred stock, upon the exercise of currently outstanding warrants and/or options, or if we issue new shares of stock or other securities, including issuances to consultants as compensation pursuant to our referral agreements. Additional issuances of preferred stock or other securities by us may further subordinate the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series C preferred stock, Series D preferred stock and Series E preferred stock may convert their shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock at any time. As of March 27, 2017, we had the following shares outstanding: (i) 5 shares of Series C preferred stock outstanding, which are convertible into a minimum of 3,335 shares of common stock based on a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) $1.50 per share, or (b) 65% of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for ten consecutive days prior to the applicable conversion date, (ii) 369 shares of Series D preferred stock, which are convertible into 186,367 shares of common stock; and (iii) 3,000 shares of Series E preferred stock, which are currently convertible into 1,496,262 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) $2.005 per share, or (b) 65% of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for ten consecutive days prior to the applicable conversion date).\nIn addition to our outstanding shares of preferred stock, as of March 27, 2017, there were currently outstanding warrants to purchase 11,615,849 shares of our common stock and 514,772 stock options. An aggregate of 12,130,621 additional shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise of these warrants and stock options.
