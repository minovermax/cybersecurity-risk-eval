{"cik": "1262104", "company": "MEI Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report and other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates Pracinostat, ME-344 and PWT143, and to develop new compounds. The actual amount of funds we will need will be determined by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates Pracinostat, ME-344 and PWT143 and to develop any additional compounds. The factors which will determine the actual amount of funds that we will need to progress the clinical trial programs for Pracinostat, ME-344 and PWT143 may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe therapeutic indications for use being developed;\n\u2022\nthe clinical trial endpoint required to achieve regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical trials required to achieve regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe number of sites included in the trials;\n\u2022\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patients;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who participate in the trials and the rate that they are recruited;\n\u2022\nthe number of treatment cycles patients complete while they are enrolled in the trials; and\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product.\nWe have been opportunistic in our efforts to obtain cash, and we expect to continue to evaluate various funding alternatives from time to time. If we obtain additional funding, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to\nobtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may be required to cease or reduce our operations. We may sell additional shares of common stock, and securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock, to satisfy our capital and operating needs; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed.\nThe number of shares of our common stock outstanding has increased substantially as a result of our December 2012 private placement, our April 2013 underwritten registered offering, our October 2013 underwritten registered offering, and our December 2014 underwritten registered offering, and some of the purchasers in the private placement beneficially own significant amounts of our common stock.\nIn December 2012, we completed the private placement of an aggregate of (i) 9,166,665 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,416,665 shares of our common stock. In April 2013, we completed an underwritten registered offering of 2,030,000 shares of our common stock. In October 2013, we completed an underwritten registered offering of 4,375,000 shares of our common stock. In December 2014, we completed an underwritten registered offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock. Some of the purchasers in the private placement beneficially own significant amounts of our common stock and will have a corresponding influence over the outcome of any stockholder vote, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.\nNegative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators.\nNegative conditions in the U.S. or global economy, including financial markets, may adversely affect our business and the business of current and prospective vendors, licensees and collaborators, and others with whom we do or may conduct business. The duration and severity of these conditions is uncertain. If negative economic conditions occur, we may be unable to secure funding to sustain our operations or to find suitable collaborators to advance our internal programs, even if we achieve positive results from our drug development programs.\nWe have a limited operating history and are likely to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nYou should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by clinical research stage and developmental companies. We were incorporated in December 2000, and have been in operation since May 2002. We have incurred net losses of $156.1 million from our inception through June 30, 2015, including net losses of $32.7 million, $27.1 million and $11.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate that we will incur operating losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We have not yet commercialized any drug candidates and cannot be sure that we will ever be able to do so, or that we may ever become profitable.\nOur stockholders may not realize a benefit from the purchase of intellectual property commensurate with the associated ownership dilution experienced.\nIn August 2012, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and intellectual property, including those related to Pracinostat, from S*Bio. Additionally, in May 2011, we completed the acquisition of certain assets (the \u201cIsoflavone Transaction\u201d) used in or generated under or in connection with the discovery, development, manufacture and marketing of intellectual property and products based on the field of isoflavonoid technology and on compounds known as isoflavones, including those related to the drug candidate ME-344 (the \u201cIsoflavone-related Assets\u201d), from Novogen.\nIf we are unable to realize the expected strategic and financial benefits from the purchase of intellectual property, our stockholders will have experienced dilution of their ownership interest as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock to Novogen to acquire the Isoflavone-related Assets, and as a result of the issuance of 195,756 shares of common stock to S*Bio to acquire certain assets and intellectual property, including those related to Pracinostat, without receiving any commensurate benefit. In the asset purchase agreement relating to the acquisition of certain assets and intellectual property from S*Bio, S*Bio made certain representations and warranties regarding its intellectual property rights to such assets; however, its indemnification obligations with respect to such representations and warranties are limited. Similarly, upon consummation of the Isoflavone Transaction, we issued to Novogen 1,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which were subsequently converted into an aggregate of 804,500 shares of our common stock in November 2012.\nAccordingly, we do not expect to be adequately compensated, if at all, for the loss of any such intellectual property rights acquired in the acquisition from S*Bio or in the Isoflavone Transaction.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials.\nPre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are an expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete. Pre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate, but rather to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to understand the drug candidate\u2019s side effects at various doses and schedules. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, including ongoing pre-clinical studies and large-scale Phase III clinical trials, and our drug candidates in later-stage trials may fail to\nshow desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier-stage trials. Unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials, or abandonment of a clinical program. Pre-clinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated, or a clinical program to be abandoned.\nFinal approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use may be delayed, limited or prevented, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nWe will not generate any operating revenue until we successfully license or commercialize one of our drug candidates. Currently, we have drug candidates at different stages of development, and each will need to successfully complete a number of studies and obtain regulatory approval before potential commercialization.\nThe preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, export, marketing and distribution, and other possible activities relating to our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions that may negatively impact the approval of one or more of our drug candidates or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nNeither collaborators nor we are permitted to market a drug candidate in the United States until the particular drug candidate is approved for marketing by the FDA. Specific preclinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, application, and clinical trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. To market a new drug in the United States, we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of an NDA. An NDA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate.\nObtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Regulatory approval of an NDA is not guaranteed. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Despite the time and expense exerted in preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na drug candidate may not be deemed adequately safe or effective;\n\u2022\nFDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s interpretation and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may differ significantly;\n\u2022\nour or our contractors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements, including those identified in other risk factors;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept an NDA or other submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nOur preclinical and clinical data, other information and procedures relating to a drug candidate may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority, or regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may be unfavorable. Our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any drug we develop.\nAdditionally, any of the following factors may serve to delay, limit or prevent the final approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nPracinostat, ME-344 and PWT143 are in the early-to-intermediate stages of development, and we will need to conduct significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy of these drug candidates before applications for marketing can be filed with the FDA, or with the regulatory authorities of other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and testing of product formulation, including identification of suitable excipients, or chemical additives intended to facilitate delivery of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nit may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates, and failure can occur at any stage of this process; and\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts.\nThe successful development of any of these drug candidates is uncertain and, accordingly, we may never commercialize any of these drug candidates or generate revenue.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize our drug candidates, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting products will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, resulting products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of our drugs and competitive drugs;\n\u2022\nactual and perceived efficacy and safety of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nstrength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nprice of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws on our drug candidates; and\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.\nIf any of our drugs are approved and fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf we receive regulatory approval to market Pracinostat, we anticipate that its label may be limited to use in combination with a hypomethylating agent, such as azacitidine, the cost and availability of which are not in our control.\nOur current clinical strategy is to develop Pracinostat for use in combination with an approved hypomethylating agent such as azacitidine. If we receive regulatory approval to market Pracinostat, we anticipate that its label may be limited to use in combination with a hypomethylating agent such as azacitidine. If approved hypomethylating agents are not available at an acceptable cost, or at all, this could prevent us from marketing Pracinostat, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to establish the contractual arrangements necessary to develop, market and distribute our product candidates.\nA key part of our business plan is to establish contractual relationships with third parties to package, market and distribute our product candidates. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate commercially acceptable licensing or other agreements for the future exploitation of our drug product candidates, including continued clinical development, manufacture or marketing. If we are unable to successfully contract for these services, or if arrangements for these services are terminated, we may have to delay our commercialization program which will adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nOur commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our drug candidates.\nThe development of drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates that have either been approved or are in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing effective drugs, our compounds may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors.\nOur competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us and our service providers, to recruit qualified personnel, and with us to attract partners for joint ventures and to license technologies that are competitive with us. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our pre-clinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including laboratories, investigators, clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, and manufacturers, to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our pre-clinical studies. CROs are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the\npotential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of collaborators, and we do not control their research and development, clinical trial or regulatory activities.\nWe have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates. Increases in the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates would increase our costs of conducting clinical trials and could adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe do not intend to manufacture our drug product candidates ourselves, and we will rely on third parties for our drug supplies both for clinical trials and for commercial quantities in the future. We have taken the strategic decision not to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) for our drug candidates, as these can be more economically supplied by third parties with particular expertise in this area. We have identified contract facilities that are registered with the FDA, have a track record of large scale API manufacture, and have already invested in capital and equipment. We have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our product candidates. If the cost of manufacturing increases, or if the cost of the materials used increases, these costs will be passed on to us, making the cost of conducting clinical trials more expensive. Increases in manufacturing costs could adversely affect our future profitability if we are unable to pass all of the increased costs along to our customers. We also rely on the contract manufacturers to comply with FDA regulatory requirements for good manufacturing practices.\nWe rely on acquisitions or licenses from third parties to expand our pipeline of drug candidates.\nWe are not presently engaged in drug discovery activities. In order to expand our pipeline of drug candidates for future development, we may need to purchase or in-license any such drug candidates. However, we may not be able to purchase or in-license future drug candidates from third parties on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk is inherent in the manufacturing, testing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Our product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities, or claims may exceed our insurance limits. If we cannot or do not sufficiently insure against potential product liability claims, we may be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business development and commercialization efforts.\nOur efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management, development and scientific personnel. We face competition for such personnel, and we believe that risks and uncertainties related to our business, including the timing and risk associated with research and development, our available and anticipated cash resources, and the volatility of our stock price, may impact our ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. The loss of services of our Chief Executive Officer or other key employees could adversely impact our operations and ability to generate or raise additional capital.\nLaws, rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, may result in increased costs to us. These laws, rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot estimate accurately the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws, rules and regulations.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur commercial success is dependent, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and preserving trade secrets, which cannot be guaranteed.\nPatent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend, in part on our ability to maintain trade secret protection, obtain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. Litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In August 2012, we acquired patents and patent applications related to Pracinostat from S*Bio. In September 2013, we acquired patents and patent applications related to PWT143 from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. Additionally, prior to the Isoflavone Transaction, Novogen had applied for patents in a number of countries with respect to the use of their isoflavone compounds, including ME-344. We acquired both issued patents and pending patent applications from Novogen in relation to our Isoflavone-based compounds, which we previously licensed from Novogen. The patent applications may not proceed to grant or may be amended to reduce the scope of protection of any patent granted. The applications and patents may also be opposed or challenged by third parties. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain effective patent protection for our compounds and their use in treating, preventing, or curing cancer, and to successfully defend patent rights in those technologies against third-party challenges. As patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until published or issued and as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, S*Bio, Novogen, or Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. were the first to make the inventions covered by the pending patent applications or issued patents referred to above or that we or they were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Additionally, the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their enforceability cannot be predicted. We cannot be sure that, should any patents issue, we will be provided with adequate protection against potentially competitive products. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that should patents issue, they will be of commercial value to us, or that private parties, including competitors, will not successfully challenge our patents or circumvent our patent position in the United States or abroad.\nClaims by other companies that we infringe on their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with the compounds that we have acquired. Therefore, Pracinostat, ME-344 and PWT143 and any other drug candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties existing now and in the future.\nFurthermore, to the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in such intellectual property or in resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties.\nWe have contracted formulation development and manufacturing process development work for our product candidates. This process has identified a number of excipients, or additives to improve drug delivery, which may be used in the formulations. Excipients, among other things, perform the function of a carrier of the active drug ingredient. Some of these identified excipients or carriers may be included in third party patents in some countries. We intend to seek a license if we decide to use a patented excipient in the marketed product or we may choose one of those excipients that does not have a license requirement.\nWe cannot be sure that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded.\nWe may be subject to substantial costs stemming from our defense against third-party intellectual property infringement claims.\nThird parties may assert that we are using their proprietary information without authorization. Third parties may also have or obtain patents and may claim that technologies licensed to or used by us infringe their patents. If we are required to defend patent infringement actions brought by third parties, or if we sue to protect our own patent rights, we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs and managerial attention may be diverted from business operations even if the outcome is not adverse to us. In addition, any legal action that seeks damages or an injunction to stop us from carrying on our commercial activities relating to the affected technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require us or any third party licensors to obtain a license to continue to use the affected technologies. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could decline in value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop our drug candidates;\n\u2022\ndesign, results and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew products introduced or announced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nexpiration or termination of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and genomics industries;\n\u2022\ninstability in the stock market as a result of current or future domestic and global events;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of any market for our securities; and\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual delisting of our common stock from a national stock exchange.\nEquity markets in general, and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets. In addition, changes in economic conditions in the U.S., Europe or globally, particularly in the context of current global events, could impact upon our ability to grow profitably. Adverse economic changes are outside our control and may result in material adverse impacts on our business or our results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our development and operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock, including common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options, may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including upon exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options, or upon issuance of shares related to restricted stock units, and any subsequent sales of such shares. As of June 30, 2015, we had outstanding (i) warrants issued in our December 2012 private placement exercisable to purchase 3,230,202 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.12 per share, which expire in December 2017; (ii) warrants issued in our May 2012 rights offering exercisable to purchase 315,484 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.14, which expire in May 2017; and (iii) Series A warrants issued in our May 2011 private placement exercisable to purchase 215,721 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00, which expire in November 2016. We also had outstanding options to purchase 1,614,317 shares of common stock and restricted stock units representing the right to receive 400,000 shares of common stock. We may seek additional capital through one or more additional equity transactions in the future; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed. If we sell shares in the future, the prices at which we sell these future shares will vary, and these variations may be significant. Stockholders will experience significant dilution if we sell these future shares at prices significantly below the price at which previous stockholders invested.\nBecause we do not intend to pay, and have not paid, any cash dividends on our shares of common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their investment unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares.\nWe will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any exercise of outstanding warrants and options.\nWe will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds to us upon any exercise of outstanding warrants and options, and investors in our stock will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors and management regarding the application of these proceeds. Although we expect to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds from any exercise of the warrants and options for general corporate purposes and progression of our clinical trial programs, we have not allocated these net proceeds for specific purposes.\nWe are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue blank check preferred stock with rights potentially senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock. The issuance of a class of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our shares, or making a change in control of the Company more difficult.\nOur executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price.\nSales of our stock by our executive officers and directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our executive officers and directors may sell stock in the future, either as part, or outside, of trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.", "PERMNO": 89935, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MEIP"}
