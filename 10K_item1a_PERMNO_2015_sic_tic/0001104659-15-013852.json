You should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported a net loss of $171.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of $350.5 million as of December 31, 2014.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses, our ability to generate revenues and the timing and amount of milestones and other required payments to third parties. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe have a very limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were incorporated in March 2010. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring product and technology rights, and conducting product development activities for our three current product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for, or demonstrated an ability to commercialize, any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history, approved products on the market, or both.\nWe currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from the three clinical-stage product candidates that we have in-licensed, rolapitant, niraparib and TSR-011. We also have not generated any revenues from the other product candidates that we have in-licensed, including TSR-042, our monospecific antibody product candidates targeting TIM-3 and LAG-3, and our dual-reactive antibody product candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 and an additional dual-reactive combination, which are in preclinical development. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products, including any of our three clinical-stage product candidates, or the other product candidates that we have or may in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for rolapitant, niraparib, TSR-011 or TSR-042, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 successfully complete development activities, including clinical trials for rolapitant, niraparib and TSR-011;\n\u00b7 complete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u00b7 complete and submit NDAs or BLAs to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u00b7 complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 set a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u00b7 obtain commercial quantities of rolapitant, niraparib, TSR-011 and any of our other product candidates at acceptable cost levels;\n\u00b7 develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7 find suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products; and\n\u00b7 obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the risk that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the process described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nIf we require additional capital to fund our operations and we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial organizations to address certain markets. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least December 31, 2015. However, we expect to require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates and may also need to raise additional funds to pursue our strategy of in-licensing or acquiring additional product candidates.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through additional public or private equity or debt offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Raising additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations, or both. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of\nfactors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both short and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for rolapitant or any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u00b7 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may in-license, including our Phase 3 clinical trials for niraparib, our various Phase 1 clinical trials of IV rolapitant and our Phase 1/2a clinical trial for TSR-011;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities;\n\u00b7 the preclinical and clinical development plans we and our collaborator, AnaptysBio, Inc., or AnaptysBio, establish for our monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 (TSR-042), TIM-3 and LAG-3 and our dual-reactive antibody product candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 and an additional dual-reactive combination;\n\u00b7 the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments, royalty payments, or both to OPKO, Merck, Amgen, or AnaptysBio or to any other future product candidate licensor, if any, under our in-licensing agreements;\n\u00b7 the number and characteristics of product candidates that we in-license and develop;\n\u00b7 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of potential conversion requests, if any, and interest expense associated with our Convertible Notes; and\n\u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nIf we lack the capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur future success is dependent primarily on the regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, including oral rolapitant, which is the subject of an NDA currently pending before the FDA.\nAlthough the oral rolapitant NDA is currently pending before the FDA, we currently do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, particularly rolapitant, niraparib and TSR-011, which are currently our only clinical-stage product candidates. We are particularly dependent on the future success of rolapitant, because it is our most advanced product candidate. Our other product candidates are at earlier stages of development. Niraparib is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in ovarian and breast cancer patients that commenced during 2013 and 2014, respectively, and TSR-011 is still early in clinical development. Our monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 (TSR-042), TIM-3 and LAG-3 and our dual-reactive antibody product candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 and an additional dual-reactive combination, are in preclinical development.\nAs a result, our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize rolapitant (and to a lesser degree, our other product candidates) in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for the product from the FDA. Similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the\ncommercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States. Even if rolapitant were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations, including use restrictions for certain patient populations; warnings, precautions or contraindications; or burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for rolapitant in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of our existing product candidates or any other product candidate that we may in-license or acquire in the future. Furthermore, even if we obtain approval for rolapitant from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we will still need to develop a commercial organization, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors. If we are unable to successfully commercialize rolapitant, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nBecause the results of preclinical testing or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, niraparib, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, or any other product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of an investigational biological product. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including many with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for niraparib and in preclinical studies for TSR-011, we do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety, or safety, purity, and potency, to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process.\nWe have various ongoing clinical trials related to our development programs for rolapitant, niraparib and TSR-011. We may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u00b7 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign entities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7 clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7 inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication;\n\u00b7 failure of our third-party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n\u00b7 feedback from the FDA, an IRB, data safety monitoring boards, or comparable foreign entities; or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol;\n\u00b7 decision by the FDA, an IRB, comparable foreign regulatory entities, or the Company; or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board or comparable foreign regulatory entity, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u00b7 unacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug or biologic;\n\u00b7 manufacturing issues, including problems with manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, the ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, whether enrolled subjects drop out before completion, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or the termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous\nfactors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may in-license or acquire and seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective, or safe, pure, and potent, for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7 failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7 disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates to support the submission and filing of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 disapproval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7 changes in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program. If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that is not desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if our product candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of similar strategies, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of any approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete a clinical trial, and could result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7 we may suspend marketing of such product;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u00b7 we may be required to develop a REMS for such product or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS, or to develop a similar strategy as required by a comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n\u00b7 we may be required to conduct post-market studies;\n\u00b7 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and\n\u00b7 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, those authorities may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug and biological products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u00b7 require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 suspend any ongoing clinical studies;\n\u00b7 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7 seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public. Violations of applicable advertising and promotion laws and regulations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment of government funds, and the individual could share in any judgment or settlement funds. Since 2004, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. For instance, in 2012, GlaxoSmithKline LLC agreed to plead guilty and to pay a total of $3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that the company promoted certain prescription drugs off-label, provided unlawful kickbacks, failed to report drug safety data, and falsely reported drug prices. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay treble damages and penalties, or agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations pursuant to a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General to avoid exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for the intravenous formulation of rolapitant could limit our commercial success.\nAlthough our clinical development efforts have been focused primarily on an oral formulation of rolapitant, we have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of an intravenous, or IV, formulation of rolapitant. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of the oral formulation, we would expect the FDA to require an NDA for approval of an IV formulation. Even if the oral formulation gains regulatory approval, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain regulatory approval of the IV formulation. To support an NDA for the IV formulation, we will have to provide clinical data specific to the IV formulation. If the clinical results of the IV formulation are positive, we estimate that it would take approximately one year following the submission of the oral form NDA for the FDA to approve the IV formulation, although our submission or FDA review could take significantly longer. The FDA may not accept our bioequivalence strategy and may require efficacy studies to support the NDA. We expect the IV formulation of rolapitant to serve what we believe is a larger portion of the market for NK-1 receptor antagonists and generate more revenue than the oral formulation. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for the IV formulation, it would negatively affect our revenue and growth prospects.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with\nmany companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of third parties to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including China, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, China or other countries, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current clinical-stage product candidates, rolapitant, niraparib and TSR-011, as well as our monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 (TSR-042), TIM-3 and LAG-3 and our dual-reactive antibody product candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 and an additional dual-reactive combination, which are in preclinical development. We will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nThere are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our clinical-stage product candidates. If rolapitant is successfully commercialized, we expect it to compete with EMEND, an NK-1 receptor antagonist marketed by Merck as well as AKYNZEO, an oral combination NK-1 receptor antagonist and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (netupitant plus ALOXI (palonosetron HCl)) that is marketed by Helsinn and Eisai. Rolapitant would face additional competition if other products were developed for the treatment and prevention of CINV, or an IV formulation of AKYNZEO is developed. If niraparib is successfully commercialized, it may face competition from other PARP inhibitors if they are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval in the same market. We are aware of several PARP inhibitors in clinical development, including AbbVie\u2019s ABT-888 (veliparib), Eisai, Inc.\u2019s E-7016, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.\u2019s CEP-9722, Clovis Oncology, Inc.\u2019s CO-338 (rucaparib) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\u2019s BMN-673 (talazoparib). If TSR-011 is successfully commercialized, we expect it to compete with Xalkori (crizotinib), a dual MET/anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK, inhibitor marketed by Pfizer and Zykadia (ceritinib), an ALK inhibitor marketed by Novartis. Zykadia was approved in December 2014 for those with ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. We are also aware of several oral ALK inhibitors in clinical development with which TSR-011 could compete if they are approved in the same market, including: Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\u2019s CH5424802 (alectinib), ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s AP26113, Astellas Pharma US, Inc.\u2019s ASP-3026, and Xcovery\u2019s X-396. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches.\nThere are also a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing the development of cancer immunotherapies that may compete with our immunotherapy product candidates, which are in preclinical development. We are aware of several companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed at the same biological targets as some of our collaboration programs with AnaptysBio. These include: Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody, OPDIVO (nivolumab), and an anti-LAG-3 antibody in development; Merck, which has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody that is commercially available by the trade name KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab),\nformerly called MK-3475; Pfizer, Genentech, Medimmune (AstraZeneca), Medivation and EMD Serono (Merck KGaA), which have anti-PDL-1 and/or anti-PD-1 modulators in development. We are also aware of several other companies with immuno-oncology antibodies or programs in the preclinical or research phase.\nOur product candidates are being developed for cancer therapeutics and oncology supportive care. There are a variety of available therapies and supportive care products marketed for cancer patients. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy or to reduce side effects. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. This may make it difficult for us to achieve our business strategy of using our product candidates in combination with existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with our product candidates.\nIn addition to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, our potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. More established companies, as well as institutions, agencies and organizations, may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug and biological products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will\nbe available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and actual acquisition cost. For drugs furnished by hospital outpatient departments, separate payment is not made by Medicare for products that do not exceed a cost per day threshold, which is the case for many existing oral anti-emetic products. It is possible that our products also would not be paid separately by Medicare in this setting. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, has made draft National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, and draft National Average Retail Price, or NARP, data publicly available on at least a monthly basis. In July 2013, CMS suspended the publication of draft NARP data, pending funding decisions. In November 2013, CMS moved to publishing final rather than draft NADAC data and has since made updated NADAC data publicly available on a weekly basis. As a result of this continuous evolution, it may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products for which we receive regulatory approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, selling and distribution costs. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition.\nIf we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid drug rebate program, and we may have obligations to report ASP figures to the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to the CMS. These data include AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.\nFederal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B and the resulting Medicare payment rate.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under\nMedicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs.\nFederal law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. To participate, we will be required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which we must make our innovator \u201ccovered drugs\u201d available to four federal agencies, the VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard, or collectively the Big Four, at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the \u201cnon-federal average manufacturer price,\u201d or Non-FAMP, which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. If a company misstates Non-FAMPs or FCPs it must restate these figures. Pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to penalties of $100,000 for each item of false information.\nFSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed \u201ctracking customer.\u201d Further, in addition to the Big Four, all other federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to access FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers other than the Big Four agencies \u201cnegotiated pricing\u201d for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP; instead, such pricing is negotiated based on a mandatory disclosure of the contractor\u2019s commercial \u201cmost favored customer\u201d pricing. We cannot anticipate the pricing structure we will enter into with respect to our products. The FSS contract price may have a material adverse effect on future revenues from sales of our products. The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nTo the extent our products become available in the retail pharmacy setting when they are commercialized, we would be subject to Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Pursant to that statute, DoD has established a program under which manufacturers are required to pay FCP-based rebates on TRICARE retail utilization of covered drugs. Rebates are computed by subtracting the applicable FCP from the corresponding annual Non-FAMP. Additionally, companies that want their covered drugs to be eligible for DoD formulary inclusion must enter into a Section 703 Agreement with TMA under which the company agrees to pay the quarterly rebates.\nIf we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or underpay rebates under the Tricare retail rebate program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations against us under the Federal False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each manufacturer is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer\u2019s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in the case of innovator products, BP figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid drug rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug discount program.\nIf we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of ASP pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP, or best price information to the\ngovernment, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize.\nIn September 2010, CMS and the OIG indicated that they intend to pursue more aggressively those companies who fail to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we participate in, or a product we successfully commercialize receives coverage under, one of these governmental programs, we cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the Affordable Care Act. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs in general from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP; and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2015, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities.\nIn 2012, CMS issued proposed regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act but has not yet issued final regulations. CMS is currently expected to release the final regulations in April 2015. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended the 2% reduction to 2023, and the\nProtecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2024. If Congress does not take action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare Part D plans could seek to reduce their negotiated prices for drugs. Other legislative or regulatory cost containment provisions, as described below, could have a similar effect.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nIf we breach the license agreements for our product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn December 2010, we entered into a license agreement with OPKO to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell rolapitant. The license agreement also extended to an additional, backup compound, SCH900978, to which we have the same rights and obligations as rolapitant, but which we are not currently advancing. In May 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Merck, under which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to certain patents and non-exclusive rights to certain Merck know-how, to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell niraparib and a backup compound, MK-2512, for all therapeutic and prophylactic uses in humans. We are not currently advancing MK-2512. In March 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Amgen to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell an ALK/TRK inhibitor product. In March 2014, we entered into a collaboration and exclusive license agreement with AnaptysBio, under which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to certain patents and intellectual property of AnaptysBio to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 and non-exclusive rights to certain other patents and intellectual property of AnaptysBio necessary to utilize the intellectual property exclusively licensed to us.\nOur agreements with OPKO, Merck and Amgen require us to use commercially reasonable efforts, in the case of rolapitant and TSR-011, and diligent efforts, in the case of niraparib, to develop and commercialize such products in accordance with such agreements, and to make timely milestone, royalty and other payments, provide certain information regarding our activities with respect to such products, maintain the confidentiality of information we receive from OPKO, Merck and Amgen and indemnify OPKO, Merck and Amgen with respect to our development and commercialization activities under the terms of the agreements. Our agreement with AnaptysBio requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to fund the initial discovery and development of each of the antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 during the time period set forth in the agreement and then to use such efforts to further develop and commercialize those candidates.\nIf we fail to meet these obligations, our licensors have the right to terminate our exclusive licenses and upon the effective date of such termination, have the right to re-obtain the licensed technology as well as aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us and developed during the period the agreements were in force that relate to the licensed technology. This means that our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of our product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us. This would also be the case if we voluntarily terminate the agreements. While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the licenses could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the applicable product candidate.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to product candidates for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe do not intend to develop product candidates from our own original research. Our business model is predicated, in part, on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment and support of cancer patients. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license any product candidates from third parties for various reasons, including because we are focusing on a specific area of care and we may be unable to identify product candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire product candidates that we may consider attractive. These\nestablished companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to in-license or acquire the relevant product candidate on terms that would allow us to generate an appropriate return on our investment.\nIn addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing prices. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial subjects or patients;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We expect to increase our insurance coverage when we begin to commercialize our product candidates, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could consume significant amounts of our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to market our products outside of the United States, and we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nBecause we intend to market products, if approved, outside of the United States, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7 efforts to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution organization may increase our expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates or cause us to forgo profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies;\n\u00b7 changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u00b7 trade-protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u00b7 the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, including certain discounts, or engaging consultants for as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs;\n\u00b7 the federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other\ncompanies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company\u2019s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, violation of the federal anti-kickback statute may be actionable under the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and to publicly report such data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program are required to have started tracking such payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year; and\n\u00b7 analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Several states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our\nreputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 108 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any in-licenses or acquisitions of new product candidates, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u00b7 managing our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7 identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u00b7 managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u00b7 improving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u00b7 expanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management team. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our co-founding executive officers.\nWe are highly dependent on Leon O. Moulder, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, and Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D., our President and Chief Operating Officer. Although we have offer letter agreements with Mr. Moulder and Dr. Hedley, these agreements are at-will and do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn addition to in-licensing or acquiring product candidates, we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses, we have, from time to time, evaluated acquisition opportunities and may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our current product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u00b7 issue stock that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u00b7 incur debt and assume liabilities; and\n\u00b7 incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe also may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. Further, future acquisitions could also pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u00b7 problems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies;\n\u00b7 increases to our expenses;\n\u00b7 the failure to have discovered undisclosed liabilities of the acquired asset or company;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities;\n\u00b7 harm to our operating results or financial condition;\n\u00b7 entrance into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nWe may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are relying on the commercial availability of diagnostic tests to identify patients who may benefit from TSR-011.\nWe believe that having a commercially available diagnostic test for the identification of ALK fusions will facilitate rapid and efficient development of our lead ALK inhibitor product candidate, TSR-011. While other diagnostic tests are in development (such as tests based on immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing), the Abbott Vysis Break Apart FISH Probe test, or Vysis diagnostic test, is currently the only commercially available diagnostic test for the identification of ALK fusions in the United States. The Vysis diagnostic test is provided by a third party who has no contractual obligation to us to continue to manufacture the test or make it available commercially or to us. We expect that manufacturers of any future diagnostic tests that may become available would similarly have no contractual obligation to us to continue to manufacture tests or to make them available commercially to us. In addition, many diagnostic tests are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the FDA or another regulatory authority could limit their use. Furthermore, the providers of diagnostic tests may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the tests or they could otherwise decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the diagnostic tests. If diagnostic tests are not commercially available, development or commercialization of TSR-011 could be adversely affected.\nOur therapeutic product candidates, including niraparib, may be approved only in combination with companion diagnostics to support certain uses. We may have difficulty receiving approval for our therapeutic product candidates for those uses from FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies if applicable companion diagnostics are not commercially available.\nFor certain of our cancer therapeutic product candidates (currently niraparib and TSR-011), we believe we have acquired product candidates for which diagnostic tests or specific clinical criteria will allow us to identify cancer patients who will be more likely to respond. We plan to rely on diagnostic tests to help us more accurately identify patients with those criteria both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. Diagnostic tests, including companion diagnostics, are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop diagnostic tests internally. We are therefore dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these tests. For example, our niraparib product candidate will use a test owned and administered by a third party to identify breast cancer patients with a BRCA gene mutation during clinical testing. We are also evaluating niraparib in patients with certain homologous recombinant deficiency, or HRD, scores. The test to determine this HRD score is owned and administered by the same third party that administers the BRCA gene mutation test. Therefore, it is possible that niraparib will be approved for these indications only in combination with one of these diagnostic tests. This third party may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for its test, or may fail to support the clinical development of niraparib for breast cancer as we expect, or may fail to keep the test on the market even if it is approved. Any such delay or failure could delay or prevent approval of niraparib for breast cancer, or products we may later acquire with similar characteristics.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of AnaptysBio, our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely upon AnaptysBio to discover and conduct preclinical research and development on antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 in accordance with the research programs that we jointly establish for those candidates. Although we participate in the planning of these programs, we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by AnaptysBio to activities related to these product candidates. AnaptysBio may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs for these candidates. If AnaptysBio fails to commit sufficient resources to any of our antibody product candidates, our preclinical programs related to the candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to AnaptysBio, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreement with AnaptysBio, AnaptysBio may not be required to perform its obligations under the agreement and may have the right to terminate the agreement.\nWe also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on these third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with GLP and Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our collaborators and CROs are required to comply with GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our collaborators or CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a given\nregulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nAnaptysBio and our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our preclinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied and rely on third parties for these functions, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner, or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Although we carefully manage our relationships with AnaptysBio and our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying and managing the performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe have no experience manufacturing our product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale and have no manufacturing facility. We are dependent on single third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any of these third parties, the manufacturing of our product candidates or products could be delayed, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently work with one contract manufacturer, or CMO, Hovione, for the production of rolapitant drug substance, and one other CMO for the production of oral rolapitant drug product for clinical trials and anticipated commercial needs if the product is approved. To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and for commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work will need to increase scale of production. We also currently work with a CMO for the production of IV rolapitant drug product for clinical use. We utilized CMOs for the manufacture of TSR-011 for use in preclinical and Phase 1/2a clinical trials. To meet our needs with respect to further clinical development, we plan to contract with additional CMOs for the manufacture of clinical supplies. Existing inventory for niraparib drug substance and drug product from Merck provided the initial clinical trial material needed for our niraparib clinical program. We have agreements in place with CMOs for the further production of niraparib to meet our clinical supply needs. For preclinical development of our monospecific antibody product candidates targeting PD-1 (TSR-042), TIM-3 and LAG-3 and our dual-reactive antibody product candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 and an additional dual-reactive combination, we currently work with one CMO for the production of biologics. For each of our product candidates, we may elect to pursue arrangements with\nother CMOs for manufacturing clinical supplies for later-stage trials and for commercialization. We have not yet qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs we utilize are unable to scale production, or if otherwise we experience any problems with them. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposition of civil and criminal penalties.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and key materials that are used to manufacture our drugs. Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these key materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing clinical study could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nBecause of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at an acceptable cost or in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products. If we successfully commercialize any of our drugs, we may be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, as our drug development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical study and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have no experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, the satisfaction of which on a timely basis may not be met.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we have the right to do so under our license agreements, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. Further, under our agreement with Merck for niraparib, Merck is responsible, subject to certain exceptions, for prosecuting the licensed patents, and we are reliant on them to do so in a diligent fashion, subject to our right to review and approve their prosecution activities. If Merck fails to conduct such activities diligently or does not take approved actions, among other reasons, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for niraparib. Similarly, under our agreement with AnaptysBio, during preclinical development of our antibody product candidate, AnaptysBio has primary responsibility for prosecuting certain licensed patents at our expense, subject in certain circumstances to our right to prior approval of expenses. If AnaptysBio fails to conduct such activities diligently or does not take approved actions, among other reasons, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for antibody product candidates targeting PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3. Following the clearance of an IND for an antibody product candidate targeting PD-1, TIM-3 or LAG-3, or a dual-reactive antibody product candidate targeting PD-1/TIM-3, PD-1/LAG-3 or an additional dual-reactive combination, we become responsible for prosecuting certain licensed patents related to that candidate.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our licensed compounds will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or which will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Although we have a number of issued patents under our licensing agreements covering our technology, our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us or, in the case of niraparib and our antibody product candidates during preclinical development, our licensor, to narrow the claims, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we, or in the case of niraparib and our antibody product candidates during preclinical development, our licensor, may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where they are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. However the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed\nin our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nPreviously, in the United States, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent. Outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. In March 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u2018first to file\u2019 system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Under either the previous or current system, third parties will be allowed to submit prior art prior to the issuance of a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. This can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including each member of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former\nemployer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical personnel, management personnel, or both from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since our initial public offering, which occurred in June 2012, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market has ranged from $11.05 per share to $51.95 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7 the results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u00b7 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and their or our respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 41.9% of our voting stock as of February 19, 2015. This group of stockholders has the ability to control us through their ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcomes of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act, and we have taken or intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we have relied or will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years from the date of the closing of our initial public offering.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Commencing with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We have limited experience complying with Section 404 and if in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Once we become subject to the attestation requirement, if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe are incurring increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of\ntime to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and have made and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These increased costs have increased, and will continue to increase, our consolidated net loss. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of February 19, 2015, we have 36,110,407 shares of common stock outstanding. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Of these outstanding shares, 15,147,953 are currently held by directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their or our affiliates and are available for sale subject to volume limitations, other restrictions under securities laws and, in some cases, vesting schedules. We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements.\nFurthermore, certain persons who were stockholders prior to our initial public offering are entitled to registration rights under the Securities Act with respect to shares they hold, which includes 14,018,620 shares held by our directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their or our affiliates. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restrictions under the Securities Act, except with respect to shares purchased by affiliates. Any sales of shares by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosure due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.\nThese future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding stock options and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiaries and affiliates. The initial number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the 2012 Incentive Plan, which became effective in April 2012, was 1,428,571 plus the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Incentive Plan, as of the effective date of the 2012 Incentive Plan (which is an additional 6,857 shares). The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2012 Incentive Plan will be increased (i) from time to time by the number of shares of our common stock forfeited upon the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, cash settlement or other termination of awards under our 2010 Incentive Plan following the effective date of the 2012 Incentive Plan, and (ii) on January 1 of each year, starting in 2014, by a number of shares of common stock equal to the lesser of (x) 4% of the shares of common stock outstanding at such time, or (y) the number of shares determined by our board of directors. Effective January 1, 2014, the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2012 Incentive Plan was increased by 1,309,560 shares. Effective January 1, 2015, the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2012 Incentive Plan was increased by 1,444,403 shares. Future stock option grants and issuances of common stock under our 2012 Incentive Plan may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nServicing our debt will require significant amounts of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance, our indebtedness, including our 3.00% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2021, or the Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur additional debt; if we incur substantial additional debt, these higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes, or any fundamental change in purchase price or any cash due upon conversion, and our creditworthiness generally.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert their notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nPursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital caption of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the\nConvertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report greater losses in our financial statements because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTo the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, conversions of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nUpon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, either cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change purchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our Company.\nThe terms of the Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change. A non-stock takeover of our Company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Convertible Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.", "PERMNO": 13456, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TSRO"}
