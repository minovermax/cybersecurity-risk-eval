Risk factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results:\nRisks relating to our business and industry\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business and may continue to materially impact our business.\n\u2022We may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of WageWorks into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the WageWorks Acquisition.\n\u2022Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the WageWorks subsidiary that could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\n\u2022Any diminution in, elimination of, or change in the availability of tax benefits for HSAs and other CDBs, or in the use of these accounts, would materially adversely affect us.\n\u2022If we are not successful in adapting to our rapidly evolving industry, our growth may be limited, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022We may be unable to compete effectively against our current and future competitors.\n\u2022Developments in the rapidly changing healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If our members do not continue to utilize our payment cards, our results of operations, business, and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nData security, technological, and intellectual property risks\n\u2022Cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents could materially adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our products and services could lead to financial and reputational damage to us and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services.\n\u2022We rely on software licensed from third parties that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our technology platforms that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation.\n\u2022Developing and implementing new and updated applications, features, and services for our technology platforms may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected, or may result in the platforms not operating as expected.\n\u2022Any disruption of service at our facilities or our third-party data centers could interrupt or delay our customers\u2019 access to our products and services.\n\u2022Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products and services.\n\u2022Our technology platforms may link to or utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\n\u2022Failure to adequately protect our brands and the intellectual property rights related to our products and services, and infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, would negatively impact our business.\n\u2022If we are unable to promote our brands effectively, our business may suffer.\n\u2022Confidentiality arrangements with team members and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nLegal and regulatory risks\n\u2022The restatement of WageWorks\u2019 previously issued financial results resulted in securities class action and stockholder litigation, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\u2022The healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving, and we cannot predict the effect that further healthcare reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022Changes in applicable federal and state laws relating to the tax benefits available through tax-advantaged healthcare accounts such as HSAs and other CDBs could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We are subject to privacy regulations, including regarding the access, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information. If we or any of our third-party vendors experience a privacy breach, it could result in substantial financial and reputational harm, including possible criminal and civil penalties.\n\u2022Changes in laws and regulations relating to interchange fees on payment card transactions could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\n\u2022Failure to comply with, or changes in, payment card industry, credit card association or other network rules or standards set by Visa or MasterCard, or changes in card association and debit network fees or products or interchange rates, could materially adversely affect us.\n\u2022We are subject to complex regulation, and any compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we are unable to meet or exceed the net worth test required by the IRS, we could be unable to maintain our non-bank custodian status.\nRisks relating to our partners and service providers\n\u2022If our Network Partners choose to partner with other providers of, or otherwise reduce offering or cease to offer, our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022A change in relationship with any of our bank identification number sponsors, or the failure by these sponsors to comply with certain banking regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022A business failure in any of our federally insured custodial depository partners would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Replacing our third-party vendors would be difficult and disruptive to our business.\nAcquisition and growth-related risks\n\u2022Our acquisition strategy may not be successful.\n\u2022We may not be able to operate, integrate, and scale our technology effectively to match our business growth.\n\u2022Failure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022We may not accurately estimate the impact on our business of developing, introducing, and updating new and existing products and services.\n\u2022We may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill.\nRisks relating to our service and culture\n\u2022Any failure to offer high-quality customer support services could adversely affect our relationships with our members, Clients, and Network Partners and our operating results.\n\u2022We rely on our management team and key team members and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel.\n\u2022If we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success.\nFinancing, tax and related risks\n\u2022We may be unable to generate or obtain sufficient capital to fund our business and growth strategy.\n\u2022The terms of our credit facility require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\n\u2022We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes due to the floating interest rate under our credit agreement.\n\u2022A decline in interest rate levels, including an environment of negative interest rates, may reduce our ability to earn income on our HSA Assets and Client-held funds and to attract HSA contributions.\n\u2022Legislative, regulatory, and legal developments involving taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Our ability to secure insurance may not be sufficient to cover potential liabilities.\n\u2022Natural disasters, pandemics or other epidemics (including the current COVID-19 pandemic), acts of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to us or our customers.\n\u2022Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\n\u2022We do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\u2022The exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or team members.\nRisks relating to our business and industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business and may continue to materially impact our business.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other interest rate market conditions have caused interest rates to decline significantly. As a result, the funds that we place with our depository partners in this environment have been, and are likely to continue to be for the foreseeable future, placed at lower interest rates than we originally expected. In addition, stock market volatility, such as a decline in the stock market, may decrease HSA investment assets and the related fees we earn from HSA investment assets.\nOur financial results related to certain of our products have also been adversely affected by the pandemic. For example, we have seen a significant decline in the use of commuter benefits and in our members' spend on healthcare, which has negatively impacted both our interchange revenue and service revenue. If the \"work from home\" trend continues after the pandemic, the revenue we receive from commuter benefits would continue to be negatively impacted. As the pandemic persists, some Clients may be unable to pay fees required under contracts and exercise \"force majeure\" or similar defenses, which would negatively impact our financial results. As an increasing number of companies go out of business, the number of our Clients and potential Clients could be adversely affected. Increased unemployment may mean that fewer of our members utilize HSAs or other CDBs and may reduce overall demand for our products. In the event our financial results continue to be severely impacted or the impact worsens, it may make it more difficult for us to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement, which could result in a breach of the financial covenants and the acceleration of our outstanding debt by our lenders.\nWe have also seen an increase in regulatory changes related to our products due to government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to see additional regulatory changes, which changes require substantial time and costs for us to ensure compliance. For example, regulatory changes related to our FSA and COBRA product have created uncertainty and additional workload on our team members, which could reduce our operational efficiency and result in additional costs.\nAs a result of the ongoing pandemic, substantially all of our team members are working from home. Sales opportunities have been impacted by the lack of travel and in-person meetings, with some opportunities delayed and most now being held virtually. We have also had to support the open enrollment activities of our Clients virtually. We may be unable to meet our service level commitments to our Clients as a result of disruptions to our work force and disruptions to third-party contractors that we rely on to provide our services. Our team members may be less efficient at home, and it may take additional time for us to pursue significant business initiatives. The risk of cybersecurity breaches and incidents, and the potential impact of these on our operations, is also higher while our team members log in to our network remotely.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our business remains highly uncertain and, as a result, may continue to have a material and adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of WageWorks into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the WageWorks Acquisition.\nThe success of the WageWorks Acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of WageWorks with our business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process is an expensive multi-year process that could take longer and cost more than anticipated and result in the loss of Clients.\nAs part of the integration process, we are working to migrate certain Clients to different technology platforms, which could result in Client attrition if we are unable to meet Client expectations or if we are unable to meet the technical requirements of our Clients. Clients may also decide to not cooperate with the platform migration process, resulting in delays to and additional costs associated with this process or the loss of those Clients. The challenges associated with the platform migration process may result in Client dissatisfaction, potentially impairing our long-term relationship with our Clients. We may also face challenges in integrating the back-office systems and people associated with these technology platforms.\nOur management team and other team members are spending significant amounts of time on integration efforts, which may distract them from their other responsibilities. Integration could also disrupt each company's ongoing businesses, result in tax inefficiencies, or create inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures, and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the WageWorks Acquisition, and could harm our financial performance.\nWe may fail to fully realize the remaining anticipated net synergies from the WageWorks Acquisition. Achievement of these remaining anticipated net synergies is based on our ability to grow revenue as a combined company, the integration of the WageWorks' CDB and other offerings with our technology platforms, and realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from the WageWorks Acquisition. Actual operating, technological, strategic, and revenue opportunities, if achieved at all, may be less significant than expected or may take longer or cost more to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the remaining anticipated net synergies expected from the WageWorks Acquisition within the anticipated timing or at all, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the WageWorks subsidiary that could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses arising out of the WageWorks Acquisition. See Item 9A - Controls and Procedures. Until fully remediated, these material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. Although we have developed a plan to address the material weaknesses, we cannot provide a timeframe as to when the remediation will be completed and tested, nor can we assure you that the remediation, integration and testing process will not reveal additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies, so that our internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures are effective. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our credit agreement, and may be required to seek waivers or repay amounts under the credit agreement earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition to remediating existing material weaknesses, we expect that the continued integration of the WageWorks business will require modifications to our internal control systems, processes, and information systems. We cannot be certain that changes to our internal control over financial reporting will be effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the market perception thereof, may be materially adversely affected.\nAny diminution in, elimination of, or change in the availability of tax benefits for HSAs and other CDBs, or in the use of these accounts, would materially adversely affect us.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is earned from tax-advantaged HSAs and other CDBs. Based on our experience with our customers, we believe that many consumers are not familiar with, or do not fully appreciate, the tax-advantaged benefits of HSAs and other CDBs. If employers reduce or cease to offer HSAs or other CDB programs, if the tax benefits for these accounts are reduced or eliminated, or if the rate of adoption of these accounts decreases, our results of operations, financial condition, business, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not successful in adapting to our rapidly evolving industry, our growth may be limited, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products and services is subject to rapid and significant change and competition. The market for administration of HSAs and other CDBs is characterized by rapid technological change, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs, existing competition, and the entrance of non-traditional competitors. In addition, there may be a limited-time opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of this market due in part to our rapidly evolving industry and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors. In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new services or compete with these new market entrants. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems, and lack of acceptance by our Clients, Network Partners and members.\nOur success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of HSAs and other CDBs, our ability to increase engagement, and our ability to demonstrate the value of our services to our existing and potential Clients, Network Partners and members. If our existing Clients, Network Partners and members do not recognize or acknowledge the benefits of our services or we do not drive engagement, then the market for our services might develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, we have limited insight into industry or broader trends that might develop and affect our business. As such, we might make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business, legal, and regulatory trends, which could harm our business. If any of these events occur, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFinally, our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to developing new technologies and services, including services that provide improved operating functionality, and adding features to their existing service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our services less desirable, resulting in the loss of our existing customers or a reduction in the fees we earn from our products and services.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against our current and future competitors.\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. We view our competition in terms of direct and indirect competitors. Our direct HSA competitors are HSA custodians and administrators that include state or federally chartered banks, such as Webster and Optum Bank, insurance companies, well-known retail investment companies, such as Fidelity Investments, and non-bank custodians approved by the U.S. Treasury as meeting certain ownership, capitalization, expertise, and governance requirements.\nWe also have numerous indirect HSA administration competitors, including benefits administrators and health plans, that license technology platforms and partner with other HSA custodians to provide \"white label\" HSA offerings. Increased focus on HSA-favorable healthcare regulatory reforms may create renewed interest and investment by our competitors in their HSA offerings and lead to greater competition, which could make it harder for us to maintain our growth trajectory. Our competitors may also offer reduced fee or no-fee HSAs, which may permit them to increase market share in our market and lead to Client and Network Partner attrition, or cause us to reduce our fees; and this risk could be compounded if legal requirements or administrative rules are interpreted in a way that makes compliance more onerous for us than for our competitors. Our other CDB administration competitors include health insurance carriers, human resources consultants and outsourcers, payroll providers, national CDB specialists, regional third-party administrators, and commercial banks.\nIf one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future Network Partners or other strategic\npartners, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solution with these parties. We have seen an increase in Network Partners that have decided to offer HSAs or other CDBs directly to their customers, and a continuation of this trend would significantly reduce our channel partner opportunities.\nWell-known retail mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity Investments, have entered the HSA business and gained significant market share. Our market share could decline if Fidelity and other mutual fund companies continue expanding their presence in the market. These investment companies have significant advantages over us in terms of brand name recognition, years of experience managing tax-advantaged retirement accounts (e.g., 401(k) and IRA), highly developed recordkeeping, trust functions, and fund advisory and customer relations management, among others. If we are unable to compete effectively with these mutual fund company competitors, our results of operations, financial condition, business, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our competitors, in particular banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have. As a result, some of these competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale, and support of their products and services and have offered, or may in the future offer, a wider range of products and services that are increasingly desired by potential customers, and they may also use advertising and marketing strategies that (including loss-leaders) achieve broader brand recognition or acceptance.\nDevelopments in the rapidly changing healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from healthcare-related saving and spending by consumers, which could be affected by changes affecting the broader healthcare industry, including decreased spending in the industry overall. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u2022government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with consumers and the general public;\n\u2022consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u2022reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u2022adverse changes in general business or economic conditions affecting healthcare industry participants.\nEven if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve now or in the future. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial, and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nIf our members do not continue to utilize our payment cards, our results of operations, business, and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nWe derived 15%, 16%, and 21% of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, from interchange fees that are paid to us when our customers utilize our payment cards. These fees represent a percentage of the expenses transacted on each card. If our customers do not use these payment cards at the rate we expect, if they elect to withdraw funds using a non-revenue generating mechanism such as direct reimbursement, or if other alternatives to these payment cards develop, our results of operations, business, and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nData security, technological, and intellectual property risks\nCyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur proprietary technology platforms enable the exchange of, and access to, sensitive information, and, as a result, we are frequently the target of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents. As one of the largest providers of HSAs and other CDBs, we are an even more attractive target for cyber-attacks, which means we must continue to secure and monitor each of our technology platforms, making sure these platforms are aligned to our industry benchmark security posture.\nOur ability to ensure the security of our technology platforms and thus sensitive customer and partner information is critical to our operations. We rely on standard Internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, including attacks by hackers and other malfeasance. Such security breaches could compromise our networks and result in the information stored or transmitted there to be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Such access, disclosure, or other loss of\ninformation could result in legal claims or proceedings leading to liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operations, and competitive position.\nA major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our business, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our services, an unwillingness of members, Clients, Network Partners and other data owners to provide us with their payment information, an unwillingness of members and other data owners to provide us with personal information, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition, security breaches could result in the loss of this sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation, indemnity obligations to our customers, fines and other liabilities, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our members, Clients and Network Partners, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services. While we have security measures in place, we have experienced data privacy incidents in the past, including several incidents in 2018. As a result, or if our security measures are breached again or unauthorized access to data is otherwise obtained as a result of third-party action, team member error or otherwise, our reputation could be significantly damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur substantial liability which could result in loss of sales and customers.\nWe have found that the security measures associated with some of the technology platforms used by WageWorks are not sufficient, and improving these security measures has taken and will continue to take significant resources. The continued integration of the WageWorks technology platforms with our technology platforms may create further vulnerabilities in our systems. If third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and are generally not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new, or increase engagement by, members, Clients and Network Partners, and subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, contractual liability, and other action or liability, thereby harming our operating results.\nFraudulent and other illegal activity involving our products and services, including our payment cards, could lead to financial and reputational damage to us and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services.\nCriminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture personal information in order to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and identity theft. We rely upon third parties for some transaction processing services, data feeds, and vendors, which subjects us to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. For example, we are exposed to risks relating to the theft of payment card numbers housed in a merchant's point of sale systems if our members use our payment cards at a merchant whose systems are compromised. We may make our members whole for losses sustained when using our payment cards, even in instances where we are not directly responsible for the underlying cause of such loss. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our payment cards, our custodial accounts or our reimbursement administration services, could result in financial and reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services, or cause our Clients, members and Network Partners to cease doing business with us.\nWe rely on software licensed from third parties that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our technology platforms that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation.\nWe rely on certain cloud-based software licensed from third parties to run our business. This software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, identified, obtained, and integrated, which would likely take a significant amount of time and harm our business. In addition, we have service level agreements with certain of our Clients and Network Partners for which the availability of this software is critical. Any decrease in the availability of our service as a result of errors, defects, a disruption or failure of our licensed software may require us to provide significant fee credits or refunds to our customers. Our software licensed from third parties is also subject to change or upgrade, which may result in our incurring significant costs to implement such changes or upgrades.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated applications, features, and services for our technology platforms may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected, or may result in the platforms not operating as expected.\nAttracting and retaining new customers requires us to continue to improve the technology underlying our proprietary technology platforms and requires our technology to operate as expected. In addition, customers are increasingly seeking a bundled solution, encompassing a wide range of features. Accordingly, we must continue to develop new and updated applications, features, and services, and maintain existing applications, features, and services. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services that enhance our customers\u2019 experience without disruption to our existing applications, features and services, or if we encounter technical obstacles that result in the technology not operating properly, we may lose potential and existing Clients and Network Partners. We rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing, and acquisitions to develop our content offerings, products and services. These efforts may:\n\u2022cost more than expected;\n\u2022take longer than originally expected;\n\u2022require more testing than originally anticipated;\n\u2022require significant cost to address or resolve technical defects or obstacles;\n\u2022require additional advertising and marketing costs; and\n\u2022require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources.\nThe revenue opportunities earned from these efforts may fail to justify the amounts spent. In addition, material performance problems, defects or errors in our existing or new software may occur in the future, which may harm our operating results.\nAny disruption of service at our facilities or our third-party data centers could interrupt or delay our customers\u2019 access to our products and services.\nThe ability of our team members, members, Network Partners, and Clients to access our technology platforms is critical to our business. We cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will be effective to prevent or minimize interruptions to our operations. Our technology platforms are hosted by third-party data centers. Our facilities and our third-party data centers are vulnerable to interruption or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022extended power loss;\n\u2022telecommunications failures from multiple telecommunications providers;\n\u2022natural disaster or an act of terrorism;\n\u2022software and hardware errors, or failures in our own systems or in other systems;\n\u2022network environment disruptions such as computer viruses, hacking and similar problems in our own systems and in other systems;\n\u2022theft and vandalism of equipment; and\n\u2022actions or events caused by or related to third parties.\nWe attempt to mitigate these risks through various business continuity efforts, including redundant infrastructure, 24/7/365 system activity monitoring, backup and recovery procedures, use of a secure storage facility for backup media, separate test systems, and change management and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all potential problems. Our data recovery centers are equipped with physical space, power, storage and networking infrastructure and Internet connectivity to support our technology platforms in the event of the interruption of services at our data centers. Even with these data recovery centers, our operations would be interrupted during the transition process should our primary data center experience a failure. Disruptions at our data centers could cause disruptions to our technology platforms and data loss or corruption. We have experienced interruptions and delays in service and availability for data centers, and bandwidth and other technology issues in the past. Any future errors, failure, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies could delay access to our products by members, Clients and Network Partners, which would harm our business. This could damage our reputation, subject us to potential liability or costs related to defending against claims or cause our members, Clients and Network Partners to cease doing business with us, any of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products and services.\nOur business depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to deliver our products and services. Interruptions in our service could negatively impact our financial results, and our reputation could be damaged if our systems are viewed as unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our service could negatively impact our financial results. Frequent or persistent system failures that result in the unavailability of our technology platforms or slower response times could reduce our members, Clients and Network Partners' ability to access our technology platforms, impair the delivery of our products and services, and harm the perception of our platforms as reliable, trustworthy, and consistent. Our insurance policies provide only limited coverage for service interruptions and may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems.\nOur technology platforms may link to or utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nOur technology platforms may incorporate software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unfavorable conditions on us. For example, by the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to offer our technology platforms that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works that we created based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, then the value of our technologies and services could be reduced.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software may be riskier than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business.\nFailure to adequately protect our brands and the intellectual property rights related to our products and services, and infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, would negatively impact our business.\nWe believe that the HealthEquity and WageWorks brands are critical to the success of our business, and we utilize trademark registration and other means to protect these brands. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to protect our brands against infringement and the value of our brands was to decrease as a result.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products and services such as our technology platforms, applications and the content on our website. We also rely on intellectual property licensed from third parties. We may unknowingly violate the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others and, thus, may be subject to claims by third parties. If so, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to defending against these claims or to protecting and enforcing our own rights. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to:\n\u2022develop non-infringing technology;\n\u2022pay damages;\n\u2022enter into royalty or licensing agreements;\n\u2022cease providing certain products or services; or\n\u2022take other actions to resolve the claims.\nAdditionally, we have largely relied, and expect to continue to rely, on copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws, as well as generally relying on confidentiality procedures and agreements with our team members, consultants, customers, and vendors, to control access to, and distribution of, technology, software, documentation, and other confidential information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain, use, or distribute our technology without authorization, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where some of our intellectual property rights may not be protected by intellectual property laws. If this were to occur, we could lose revenue as a result of competition from products infringing or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property and we may be required to initiate litigation to protect our proprietary rights and market position. U.S. copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of some foreign countries\ndo not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Accordingly, defense of our intellectual property and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we continue to expand our operations.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and technology is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the intellectual property or technology on which we rely. If competitors are able to use our intellectual property or technology without recourse, our ability to compete would be harmed and our business would be materially and adversely affected. We may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others.\nThe loss of our intellectual property or the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend successfully against an infringement action could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to promote our brands effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that promoting our brands in an effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services, attracting new customers and strategic partners, and integrating the WageWorks business and Clients. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote our brands, or incur substantial expenses in doing so, we may fail to attract or retain a sufficient number of Clients and Network Partners necessary for us to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products and services, or to fully and effectively integrate the WageWorks business and clients.\nWe currently own the web domain names www.healthequity.com and www.wageworks.com, among others, which are critical to the operation of our business. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names, or Internet addresses, is generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names in the U.S. is subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. Furthermore, it is unclear whether laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights will be extended to protect domain names. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks and other proprietary rights. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy of establishing strong branding if we cannot prevent others from using similar domain names or trademarks. This failure could impair our ability to increase our market share and revenue.\nConfidentiality arrangements with team members and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our technology, business operations and business plans. In order to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely in significant part on confidentiality arrangements with our team members, independent contractors, advisors, customers, and other partners. These arrangements may not be effective to prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nLegal and regulatory risks\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving, and we cannot predict the effect that further healthcare reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Affordable Care Act, which includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that have become effective at varying times, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may significantly impact our industry. Further changes to the Affordable Care Act and related healthcare regulation remain under consideration.\nIn addition, proposals to implement a single payer or \"Medicare for all\" system in the U.S., if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The full impact of healthcare reform and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is unknown, and may be affected by President Biden's administration and a Democratically controlled Congress. Accordingly, we are unable to predict what effect healthcare reform measures will have on our business.\nChanges in applicable federal and state laws relating to the tax benefits available through tax-advantaged healthcare accounts such as HSAs and other CDBs could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe efforts of governmental and third-party payers to raise revenue or contain or reduce the costs of healthcare as well as legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the U.S. healthcare system, which could include restructuring the tax benefits available through HSAs, HRAs, FSAs, and similar tax-advantaged healthcare accounts, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, the federal government or states may seek to raise revenues by enacting tax laws that eliminate the tax deductions available to individuals who contribute to HSAs. In addition, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be negatively impacted by changes to the federal and state tax laws related to our non-healthcare CDBs, such as our commuter product. Our business is substantially dependent on the tax benefits available through HSAs and other CDBs. In addition, changes to the regulatory landscape impacting our products may require substantial time and costs for us to ensure our products are compliant. For example, regulatory changes related to our FSA and COBRA products enacted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have created uncertainty and additional workload on our team members, which could reduce our operational efficiency and result in additional costs. We cannot predict if any new tax reforms will ultimately become law, or if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such reforms will be. If the laws or regulations are changed to limit or eliminate the tax benefits available through these accounts, such a change would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe restatement of WageWorks\u2019 previously issued financial results resulted in securities class action and stockholder litigation, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur subsidiary WageWorks and certain of its former directors and officers are subject to securities class action and stockholder litigation relating to its previous public disclosures. See Note 7-Commitments and contingencies of the Notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these legal proceedings and investigations. While we have signed a term sheet to settle the securities class action, the settlement is subject to notice to class members and approval of the Court, the other stockholder litigation continues, and additional stockholder litigation was initiated subsequent to the end of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. These lawsuits may result in substantial liability and other adverse consequences to us. In addition, WageWorks could become subject to additional private litigation or investigations arising out of alleged misstatements in its previously issued financial statements. Our management team may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant additional expenses in connection with these proceedings and investigations in order to defend this litigation and to fulfill indemnification obligations to former officers and directors of WageWorks.\nWe are subject to privacy regulations, including regarding the access, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information. If we or any of our third-party vendors experience a privacy breach, it could result in substantial financial and reputational harm, including possible criminal and civil penalties.\nState and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, access, and use of personally identifiable information, including HIPAA and HITECH, which govern the treatment of protected health information, and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, which governs the treatment of nonpublic personal information. In the provision of services to our customers, we and our third-party vendors may collect, access, use, maintain, and transmit personally identifiable information in ways that are subject to many of these laws and regulations. Although we have implemented measures to comply with these privacy laws, rules, and regulations, we have experienced data privacy incidents. Any further unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information experienced by us or our third-party vendors could result in substantial financial and reputational harm, including possible criminal and civil penalties. In many cases, we are subject to HIPAA and other privacy regulations because we are a business associate providing services to covered entities; as a result, the covered entities direct HIPAA compliance matters in the event of a security breach, which complicates our ability to address harm caused by the breach. As a result of the WageWorks Acquisition, we now obtain substantially more HIPAA data than before the WageWorks Acquisition. Additionally, as we have in connection with prior security incidents, we may be required to report breaches to partners, regulators, state attorney generals, and impacted individuals depending on the severity of the breach, our role, legal requirements, and contractual obligations.\nPrivacy regulation has become a priority issue in many states, and as such the regulatory environment is continually changing. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies, such as ours, that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. We expect further privacy requirements to be applicable to us as a result of the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act, as it significantly modifies the CCPA by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. Other governmental authorities are also considering legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.\nContinued compliance with current and potential new privacy laws, rules, and regulations and meeting consumer expectations with respect to the control of personal data in a rapidly changing technology environment could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us, as well as costly penalties in the event we are deemed to not be in compliance with such laws, rules, and regulations.\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to interchange fees on payment card transactions could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nExisting laws and regulations limit the fees or interchange rates that can be charged on payment card transactions. For example, the Federal Reserve Board has the power to regulate payment card interchange fees and has issued a rule setting a cap on the interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single payment card transaction. Our HSA-linked payment cards are exempt from this rule, although we are subject to a general requirement of reasonable compensation for services rendered. To the extent that our payment cards lose their exempt status, the interchange rates applicable to transactions involving our payment cards could be impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with, or changes in, payment card industry, credit card association or other network rules or standards set by Visa or MasterCard, or changes in card association and debit network fees or products or interchange rates, could materially adversely affect us.\nWe, and the banks that issue our prepaid debit cards, are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and Visa and MasterCard association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us, including card processors. Failure to comply with these rules and standards could result in significant fines, other penalties, or the termination of our interchange revenue agreements. The termination of the card association registrations held by us or any of the banks that issue our cards, or any changes in card association or other debit network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules, participants deciding to use PIN networks, standards or guidance that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services, or limit our ability to receive interchange fees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business, and prospects. In addition, from time-to-time, card associations increase the organization or processing fees that they charge, which could increase our operating expenses, reduce our profit margin and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business, and prospects.\nWe are subject to complex regulation, and any compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.\nOur business, including HSAs and many of the CDBs we administer and our investment adviser and trust company subsidiaries, is subject to extensive, complex, and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations, including IRS, Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), and Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) regulations; ERISA, HIPAA, HITECH, and other privacy and data security regulations; the Advisers Act; state banking laws; state third-party administrator laws, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nOur subsidiary HealthEquity Advisors, LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser that provides automated web-only investment advisory services. As such, it must comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act and related SEC regulations and is subject to periodic inspections by the SEC staff. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the adviser and its clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser\u2019s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations.\nOur subsidiary HealthEquity Trust Company is a non-depository trust company and subject to regulation and supervision by the Wyoming Division of Banking.\nCompliance with regulatory requirements may divert internal resources and take significant time and effort. Any claim of non-compliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the HHS, the DOL, the SEC, the Wyoming Division of Banking, or other regulatory authorities. This in turn could result in additional claims or class action litigation brought on behalf of our members or Network Partners, any of which could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources away from our operations. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation. In addition, all of our business is subject, to varying degrees, to fiduciary and other service provider obligations under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and underlying regulations. A failure to comply could subject us to disgorgement of profits, excise taxes, civil penalties, private lawsuits, and other costs, including reputational harm.\nIf we are unable to meet or exceed the net worth test required by the IRS, we could be unable to maintain our non-bank custodian status.\nAs a non-bank custodian, we are required to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-2(e), or the Treasury Regulations, including the net worth requirements set forth therein. If we should fail to comply with the Treasury Regulations\u2019 non-bank custodian requirements, including the net worth requirements, such failure would materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain our current custodial accounts and grow by adding additional custodial accounts, and it could result in the institution of procedures for the revocation of our authorization to operate as a non-bank custodian.\nRisks relating to our partners and service providers\nIf our Network Partners choose to partner with other providers of, or otherwise reduce offering or cease to offer, our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our Network Partners\u2019 willingness to partner with us to offer their customers and/or employees our products and services. In particular, certain of our Network Partners enjoy significant market share in various geographic regions. If these Network Partners choose to partner with our competitors, or otherwise reduce offering, or cease to offer, our products and services, our results of operations, business, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nA change in relationship with any of our bank identification number sponsors, or the failure by these sponsors to comply with certain banking regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of bank identification number, or BIN, sponsors in relation to the payment cards we issue. A BIN sponsor is a bank or credit union that provides the BIN that allows a prepaid card program to run on one of the major card brand networks (e.g., VISA, MasterCard, Discover or American Express). Our BIN sponsors enable us to link the payment cards that we offer our members to the VISA and Mastercard networks, thereby allowing our members to use our payment cards to pay for expenses with a \u201cswipe\u201d of the card. If any material adverse event were to affect our BIN sponsors, including a significant decline in the financial condition of any of our BIN sponsors, a decline in the quality of service provided by our BIN sponsors, the inability of our BIN sponsors to comply with applicable banking and financial service regulatory requirements or industry standards, systems failure or the inability of our BIN sponsors to pay us fees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because we may be forced to reduce the availability of, or eliminate entirely, our payment card offering, which would materially impact our interchange revenue. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts with our BIN sponsors, and our BIN sponsors may increase the fees charged to us or terminate our relationship. If we were required to change BIN sponsors, we could not accurately predict the success of such change or that the terms of our agreement with a new BIN sponsor would be as favorable to us, especially in light of the regulatory scrutiny of the payment card industry, which has rendered the market for BIN sponsor services less competitive.\nA business failure in any of our federally insured custodial depository partners would materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs a non-bank custodian, we rely on our federally insured custodial depository partners to hold the vast majority of our custodial cash assets. If any material adverse event were to affect one of our federally insured depository partners, including a significant decline in its financial condition, a decline in the quality of its service, loss of deposits, its inability to comply with applicable banking and financial services regulatory requirements, systems failure or its inability to pay us fees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we were required to change depository partners, we could not accurately predict the success of such change or that the terms of our agreement with a new depository partner would be as favorable to\nus as our current agreements, especially in light of the consolidation in the banking industry, which has rendered the market for federally insured retail banking services less competitive.\nReplacing our third-party vendors would be difficult and disruptive to our business.\nWe have entered into contracts with third-party vendors to provide critical services relating to our business, including the redesign of our technology platforms, fraud management and other customer verification services, transaction processing and settlement, telephony services, call centers and card production. In addition, WageWorks uses third-party vendors for its COBRA transaction processing and also uses one of our competitors for card processing and other services. In the event that these service providers fail to maintain adequate levels of support, do not provide high quality service, increase the fees they charge us, discontinue their lines of business, terminate our contractual arrangements or cease or reduce operations, we may suffer additional costs and be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could harm our reputation, materially disrupt our operations and our ability to provide our products and services, and could divert management\u2019s time and resources. A transition to a new vendor could take a significant amount of time and resources and, if we are unable to complete a transition to a new provider on a timely basis, or at all, we could be forced to temporarily or permanently discontinue certain services, such as our payment card services, which could disrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also be unable to establish comparable new third-party relationships on as favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAcquisition and growth-related risks\nOur acquisition strategy may not be successful.\nWe have in the past acquired, and, as a key part of our strategy, seek to acquire or invest in, assets, businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating such acquisitions, or even if consummated, realize the anticipated benefits of these or any future acquisitions. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses related to identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nThere are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to assimilate or integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition, and our management may be distracted from operating our business. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022incurrence of acquisition-related costs, which would be recognized as a current period expense;\n\u2022inability to earn sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u2022the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our technology platforms and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brand;\n\u2022the need to integrate or implement additional controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022harm to our existing business relationships with customers and strategic partners as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources from our core business;\n\u2022the potential loss of key team members;\n\u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business and diversion of management and employee resources;\n\u2022our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and that have different business cultures;\n\u2022our inability to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the acquired business;\n\u2022the inability to recognize acquired revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies; and\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition.\nAcquisitions also increase the risk of unforeseen legal liability, including for potential violations of applicable law or industry rules and regulations, arising from prior or ongoing acts or omissions by the acquired businesses which are not discovered by due diligence during the acquisition process. Generally, if an acquisition fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial condition may suffer. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition. Even if we are successful in completing and integrating an acquisition, the acquisition may not perform as we expect or enhance the value of our business as a whole.\nWe may not be able to operate, integrate, and scale our technology effectively to match our business growth.\nOur ability to continue to provide our products and services to a growing number of customers, as well as to enhance our existing products and services, attract new customers and strategic partners, offer new products and services, and continue the integration of the WageWorks business into our business, is dependent on our information technology systems. If we are unable to manage the technology associated with our business effectively, we could experience increased costs, reductions in system availability, and customer loss. We are currently investing in a significant modernization of our proprietary technology platforms to support new opportunities and enhance security, privacy, and platform infrastructure. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these upgrades to our technology platforms, we may be unable to adequately meet the needs of our customers and/or implement technology-based innovation in response to a rapidly changing market, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to manage future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe continued rapid expansion and development of our business has placed a significant strain upon our management and administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 5.8 million HSAs and $14.3 billion in HSA assets representing growth of 8% and 24%, respectively, from January 31, 2020. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $733.6 million and $240.8 million, respectively, which represents year-over-year annual growth rates of approximately 38% and 23%, respectively. See \u201cKey financial and operating metrics\u201d for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA. Our growth strategy contemplates further increasing the number of our HSAs, CDBs and our HSA Assets at relatively higher growth rates than industry averages. However, the rate at which we have been able to add new HSAs, CDBs and HSA Assets in the past may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to grow in the future.\nOur success depends in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. Our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise, and manage new team members, obtain financing for our capital needs, expand our systems effectively, control increasing costs, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our operational functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressures on our management and administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations or that we will be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve further growth at all. If our business does not continue to grow or if we fail to effectively manage any future growth, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not accurately estimate the impact on our business of developing, introducing, and updating new and existing products and services.\nWe intend to continue to invest in technology and development to create new and enhanced products and services to offer our customers and to enhance the capabilities of our platforms. We may not be able to anticipate or manage new risks and obligations or legal, compliance, or other requirements that may arise in these areas. The anticipated benefits of such new and improved products and services may not outweigh the costs and resources associated with their development. Some new services may be received negatively by our existing and/or potential customers and strategic partners and have to be put on hold or canceled entirely.\nOur ability to attract and retain new customer revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and services and to introduce new products and services. The success of any enhancement or new product or service depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the enhancement or new product or service. Any new product or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to earn significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new products or services or enhance our existing products or services to meet member or network partner requirements, our results of operations, financial condition, business or prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill.\nOur consolidated balance sheet includes significant intangible assets, including approximately $1.33 billion in goodwill and $767.0 million in intangible assets, together representing approximately 77% of our total assets as of January 31, 2021. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments. We test our goodwill for impairment each fiscal year, but we also test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at any time when there is a change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. Any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in substantial non-cash impairment charges, which could significantly impact our reported operating results.\nRisks relating to our service and culture\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support services could adversely affect our relationships with our members, Clients, and Network Partners and our operating results.\nOur customers depend on our support and customer education organizations to educate them about, and resolve technical issues relating to, our products and services. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for education and support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without a corresponding increase in revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our products, services, and business and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Further, WageWorks uses third-party vendors for its call centers and COBRA claims and transaction processing, including certain offshore vendors for member chat service, which vendors may not provide the same quality of support services for our Clients and members. Any failure to maintain high-quality education and technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality education support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our products and services to existing and prospective customers and our business and operating results. We promote 24/7/365 education and support along with our proprietary technology platforms. Interruptions or delays that inhibit our ability to meet that standard may hurt our reputation or ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe rely on our management team and key team members and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our founder and senior management team and other key personnel. While we have entered into offer letters or employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, all of our team members are \u201cat-will\u201d employees, and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason, and without notice, subject, in certain cases, to severance payment rights. In order to retain valuable team members, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we provide stock options and other equity-based awards that vest over time or based on performance. The value to team members of these awards will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract offers from other organizations. The departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our business, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to employ a suitable replacement for the departing individual, or that a replacement could be hired on terms that are favorable to us. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may affect our ability to attract replacements should key personnel depart.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate additional skilled management personnel. For example, competition for qualified personnel in our field and geographic market is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry, particularly in the technology-related fields. In addition, we have experienced employee turnover as a result of the WageWorks Acquisition and expect to continue to experience employee turnover in the future. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New team members may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our retention efforts are not successful or our employee turnover rate increases in the future, our business will be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. As we continue to grow, including through the integration of WageWorks team members, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to\npreserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nFinancing, tax and related risks\nWe may be unable to generate or obtain sufficient capital to fund our business and growth strategy.\nTo fund our expanding business and growth strategy, we must have sufficient working capital to continue to make significant investments in our service offerings, advertising, technology, and other activities. As a result, in addition to the revenue we earn from our business, we may need additional equity or debt financing to provide the funds required for these endeavors. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to operate or expand our business in the manner and at the rate desired. For example, our existing credit agreement may make it more challenging to incur additional debt, as it includes prohibitions against incurring additional debt without approval from our existing lenders, and other lenders may not be willing to take on the risk of adding to our existing leverage, In addition, debt financing increases expenses, may contain covenants that restrict the operation of our business and must be repaid regardless of operating results. Equity financing, or debt financing that is convertible into equity, could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those associated with our common stock.\nOur inability to generate or obtain the financial resources needed to fund our business and growth strategies may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations or the expansion of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nThe terms of our credit facility require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nWe are party to a $1.6 billion credit agreement, which consists of (i) a five-year senior secured term loan A facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350 million. The credit agreement is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our assets. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants related to the following subjects: mergers and sales of assets; limitations on the incurrence of certain liens; limitations on certain indebtedness; limitations on the ability to pay dividends; certain affiliate transactions; and financial performance covenants. If we default under the credit agreement, the lenders will be able to declare all obligations immediately due and payable and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate the credit agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. The lenders' rights to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds.\nWe may be adversely affected by interest rate changes due to the floating interest rate under our credit agreement.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (i) LIBOR (adjusted for reserves) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.25%, with the applicable margin determined by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. As such, our financial position may be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, although the credit agreement provides an alternative mechanism for determining the applicable interest rate when LIBOR is no longer available, the interest rates we pay may be adversely affected as a result of potential disruptions in the credit market at the end of 2021 when LIBOR is scheduled to be phased out.\nA decline in interest rate levels, including an environment of negative interest rates, may reduce our ability to earn income on our HSA Assets and Client-held funds and to attract HSA contributions.\nWe partner with our depository partners to hold our HSA Assets and other Client-held funds. We earn a significant portion of our consolidated revenue from fees we earn from our depository partners, approximately 26%, 34%, and 44% during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. A decline in prevailing interest rates, such as the current low interest rate environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or a negative interest rate environment, has and may continue to negatively affect our business by reducing the yield we realize on our HSA Assets and other Client-held funds. In addition, if we do not offer competitive interest rates on HSA Assets, our members may choose another HSA custodian. Similarly, if the value of the invested funds we hold declines, whether due to market conditions or other factors, our fees, which are based on a percentage of the asset values, would be adversely affected. Any such scenario could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLegislative, regulatory, and legal developments involving taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provisions for income taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes. For example, President Biden\u2019s campaign proposals included increasing the U.S. corporate income tax rate and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. If these proposals are ultimately enacted, they could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.\nWe do not collect sales and use taxes in all jurisdictions in which our customers are located, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use tax laws and rates vary by jurisdiction and such laws are subject to interpretation. In those jurisdictions and in those cases where we do believe sales taxes are applicable, we collect and file timely sales tax returns. Currently, such sales taxes are minimal. Jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in the assessment of such taxes, interest, and penalties, and we could be required to collect such taxes in the future. This additional sales and use tax liability could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nGeneral risk factors\nOur ability to secure insurance may not be sufficient to cover potential liabilities.\nWe maintain various forms of liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions, fiduciary, cybersecurity, employment practices, and directors and officers insurance. It is possible, however, that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may affect the current market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nNatural disasters, pandemics or other epidemics (including the current COVID-19 pandemic), acts of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to us or our customers.\nNatural disasters, pandemics or other epidemics (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) acts of war, terrorist attacks, and the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects, such as imposition of increased security measures, changes in applicable laws, market disruptions, and job losses. Such events may have an adverse effect on the economy in general. Moreover, the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to such threats could affect the business in ways that cannot be predicted. The effect of any of these events or threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results, including our revenue, gross profit, net income, and cash flows, and certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, may vary significantly in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline rapidly, may lead analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, could cause short-term liquidity issues, may impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating expenses and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance.\nWe do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have no current plans to declare and pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us difficult; even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions include the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent and certain advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nominations for candidates for the election of directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Accordingly, our board of directors could rely upon these or other provisions in our governing documents and Delaware law to prevent or delay a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or team members.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors and officers to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other team members, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other team members. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14803, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HQY"}
