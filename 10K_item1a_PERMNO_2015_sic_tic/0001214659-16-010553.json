{"cik": "1546296", "company": "Professional Diversity Network, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition\nWe have incurred net losses, our liquidity has been significantly reduced and we could continue to incur losses and negative cash flow in the future.\nWe recorded net loss of approximately $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Although our revenue grew from $11.6 million to $38.6 million during 2015, our costs and expenses also increased from $17.2 million to $72.5 million, and as a result our losses from operations increased from $5.6 million to $33.9 million during 2015, which included $25.1 million of impairment expense. In addition, we used $6.2 million in cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2015. We will need to generate increased revenues and/or substantially cut costs to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Despite our efforts, including our cost-cutting program, we may not achieve profitability or positive cash flow in the future, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable.\nThe continuation of our business depends upon additional financial support, and if we are unable to borrow under our Credit Agreement, we may not be able to obtain other financing on terms satisfactory to us, when necessary or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBased on the fact that we used $6.2 million in cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2015, the continuation of our business is dependent upon additional financial support. On March 30, 2016, we entered into a Master Credit Facility Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with White Winston Select Asset Funds, LLC (\u201cWhite Winston\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the \u201cFacility\u201d) in the principal amount up to the lesser of $5,000,000 or 75% of the outstanding balance of eligible customer receivables. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at 8% per annum. We expect to close the transaction in April 2016 upon receipt of required regulatory approvals.\nUpon closing of the Credit Agreement we expect to borrow an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 under the Credit Agreement. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the Credit Agreement will be dependent on us having sufficient eligible customer receivables. If we are unable to borrow under the Credit Agreement, based on our current financial condition, we may not be able to obtain other financing on the terms satisfactory to us, when necessary, or at all. If we are unable to obtain third party financing, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as seeking additional equity capital, reducing operations, or liquidating assets. Any such actions could adversely affect our financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets will be pledged to secure our outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement will be secured by a first priority lien in all our consolidated tangible and intangible assets, including all receivables from the operations of our business and all of the outstanding ownership interests in each of the Company\u2019s direct and indirect subsidiaries. Upon closing, there will be $2,000,000 outstanding under our Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, the lender could declare our entire indebtedness under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and, if we do not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, liquidate our assets to pay off the amounts owed. If any of our assets were to be liquidated, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRestrictions in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.\nOur Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate or permit liens on assets;\n\u00b7\nmake acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nengage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u00b7\nenter into affiliate transactions; and\n\u00b7\npay dividends or repurchase stock.\nCompliance with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain at the end of each semi-annual fiscal period commencing with the period ending December 31, 2016, a minimum current ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.4 to 1. Our ability to meet this financial ratio and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to do so. If we breach any of the covenants under Credit Agreement and do not obtain appropriate waivers, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.\nWhite Winston may have significant influence over our business, including due to its right to designate three of nine nominees for election to our Board of Directors, and White Winston\u2019s interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nUpon closing of the Credit Agreement, we will issue to White Winston (i) a warrant (the \u201cFixed $0.25 Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $0.25 per share, (ii) a warrant (the \u201cPro Rata Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 1,750,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $0.25 per share, and (iii) a warrant (the \u201cFixed $2.50 Warrant,\u201d and together with the Fixed $0.25 Warrant and the Pro Rata Warrant, the \u201cWarrants\u201d) to purchase up to up to a 1,000,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $2.50 per share, each exercisable for 5 years from the date of issuance. Upon closing of the Credit Agreement and for so long as White Winston beneficially owns more than 10% of our outstanding common stock, White Winston will have the right to designate three nominees for election to our Board of Directors. As a result, White Winston may have significant influence over our business. White Winston\u2019s interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nFurthermore, White Winston will have a contractual right to maintain the percentage of its ownership in our Company. Therefore, while other holders of our common stock would risk suffering dilution of their ownership interest in connection with a new issuance of securities by us, White Winston would have the opportunity to avoid such dilution.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market may delist our common stock from quotation on its exchange, which would to reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nIn October 2015, we received a deficiency notice from NASDAQ stating that for the last 30 consecutive days we had not met the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share, as required by the NASDAQ Listing Rules. We have 180 calendar days, or until April 13, 2016, to regain compliance. If we fail to regain compliance by April 13, 2016, NASDAQ may afford us a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance provided that, on April 13, 2016, the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial NASDAQ listing standards, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement. To be eligible for the second compliance period, the Company would need to provide written notice to NASDAQ of its intention to cure the deficiency during such period. We intend to provide to NASDAQ the written notice stating our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If we fail to regain compliance during the second compliance period, our common stock will be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, it would have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our stock when you wish to do so. In case of delisting, we could also face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market for online professional networks is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to increase, particularly in the market for online professional networks.\nOur industry is rapidly evolving and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established online professional networking companies, such as LinkedIn or Monster Worldwide, may focus on the online diversity professional networking market and could directly compete with us. Rival companies or smaller companies, including application developers, could also launch new products and services that could compete with us and gain market acceptance quickly. Individual employers have and may continue to create and maintain their own network of diverse candidates.\nWe also expect that our existing competitors will focus on professional diversity recruiting. A number of these companies may have greater resources than we do, which may enable them to compete more effectively. For example, our competitors with greater resources may partner with wireless telecommunications carriers or other Internet service providers that may provide Internet users, especially those that access the Internet through mobile devices, incentives to visit our competitors\u2019 websites. Such tactics or similar tactics could decrease the number of our visits, unique visitors and number of users and members, which would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, users of online social networks, such as Facebook, may choose to use, or increase their use of, those networks for professional purposes, which may result in those users decreasing or eliminating their use of our specialized online professional network. Companies that currently do not focus on online professional diversity networking could also expand their focus to diversity networking. LinkedIn may develop its own proprietary online diversity network and compete directly against us. To the extent LinkedIn develops its own network or establishes alliances and relationships with others, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Finally, other companies that provide content for professionals could develop more compelling offerings that compete with us and adversely impact our ability to keep our members, attract new members or sell our solutions to customers.\nIf we do not continue to attract new members to the NAPW Network, or if existing NAPW Network members do not renew their subscriptions, renew at lower levels or on less favorable terms, or fail to purchase additional offerings, we may not achieve our revenue projections, and our operating results would be harmed.\nIn order to grow the NAPW Network, we must continually attract new members to the NAPW Network, sell additional product and service offerings to existing NAPW Network members and reduce the level of non-renewals. Our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with NAPW Network members, and even when we do, the members can generally terminate their relationship with us. Further, unlike companies with different business models, the nature of our product and service offerings is such that members may decide to terminate or not renew their agreements without causing significant disruptions to their own businesses.\nWe must demonstrate to NAPW Network members that our product and service offerings provide them with access to an audience of influential, affluent and highly-educated women. However, potential members may not be familiar with our product and service offerings or may prefer other more traditional products and services for their professional advancement and networking needs. The rate at which we expand the NAPW Network\u2019s membership base or increase its members\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including the prices of product and service offerings, the prices of products and services offered by competitors or reductions in their professional advancement and networking spending levels due to macroeconomic or other factors and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our offerings. If we do not attract new members to the NAPW Network or if NAPW Network members do not renew their agreements for our product and service offerings, renew at lower levels or on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional offerings, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nOur revenue has been more volatile due to a loss of our two major customers in 2014, and if we are unable to replace the revenue from those customers, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nHistorically, our revenues were highly dependent on Apollo Education Group, Inc. (\u201cApollo Group\u201d) and LinkedIn Corporation (\u201cLinkedIn\u201d), our two former major customers. These customers in the aggregate accounted for 14.0% and 85.2% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Both Apollo Group and LinkedIn terminated their agreements with the Company effective in 2014. Under our agreement with Apollo Group, we received a fixed monthly fee of $116,667 and under our agreement with LinkedIn we received fixed quarterly payments of $500,000 per quarter. Following the termination of our agreements with Apollo Group and LinkedIn, our revenues became more volatile because we became more dependent on our direct sales, monetizing Noble Voice career consultations and NAPW Network membership fees for revenue, which are subject to variations unlike the fixed fees that we used to get from LinkedIn and Apollo Group. It is uncertain when, and to what degree, we would be able to replace the revenues we had received from LinkedIn and Apollo Group under the terminated agreements. Failure to replace the $500,000 per quarter and $116,667 per month decrease in revenue we received from LinkedIn and Apollo Group, respectively, would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and complete sufficient acquisitions to meet our growth strategy, and even if we are able to do so, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nPart of our growth strategy is to acquire companies that we believe will add to and/or expand our service offerings.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all. Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. Actual cost savings and synergies which may be achieved from an acquired entity may be lower than expected and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate. Our acquisitions have previously required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, in particular with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. For example, we now face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of the NAPW Network and Noble Voice which we acquired in 2014 with our PDN Network. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, which include:\n\u00b7\nconflicts and inconsistencies in information technology and infrastructures;\n\u00b7\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and an acquired entity;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the retention of existing customers and attraction of new customers;\n\u00b7\noverlap of users and members of an acquired entity and one of our websites;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in retaining key employees;\n\u00b7\nthe identification and elimination of redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of tax costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of the operations; and\n\u00b7\nloss of customer goodwill.\nIf we fail to successfully complete the integration of an acquired entity, or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of an acquired entity, or financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our information systems and if our access to this technology is impaired, or we fail to further develop our technology, our business could be significantly harmed.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage substantial amounts of information, including our database of our members. To achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our information systems. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our information systems to evolving industry standards and to improve the performance and reliability of our information systems. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through independent consultants, of new proprietary software. Our inability to design, develop, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur direct sales strategy, which requires personal interaction with employers and third party recruiters, may limit our ability to grow recruitment revenue and recruitment advertising revenue.\nAs part of our strategy to market our products and services directly to employers and third party recruiters, we rely on our direct sales force for recruitment revenue and recruitment advertising revenue. We currently employ professionals in sales, sales support and marketing who are trained in selling our products and services. Since its creation in 2013, we have been optimizing the direct sales team and refining the manner in which our products and services are sold. While the Company made progress in growing its direct sales, we have not matured the sales force to the point of predictability, nor have we sold enough services to achieve profitability. There is no assurance that our direct sales strategy we will yield sufficient recruitment revenue and recruitment advertising revenue in the future.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our websites are accessible within an acceptable load time.\nAn element that is key to our continued growth is the ability of our members and other users that we work with to access any of our websites within acceptable load times. We call this website performance. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time.\nIf any of our websites are unavailable when users attempt to access it or do not load as quickly as users expect, users may seek other websites to obtain the information or services for which they are looking, and may not return to our websites as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract members and other users and increase engagement on our websites. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, acts of terrorism and cyber-attacks.\nOur systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks and similar events. For systems which are not based in cloud storage, we have implemented a disaster recovery program, maintained by a third party vendor, which allows us to move production to a back-up data center in the event of a catastrophe. Although this program is functional, it does not yet provide a real-time back-up data center, so if our primary data center shuts down, there will be a period of time that such website will remain shut down while the transition to the back-up data center takes place. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Although we carry cyber security insurance our claims may exceed the insurance coverage, and we may not be fully compensated by third party insurers in the event of service interruption or cyber-attack. Furthermore, our business may never recover from such an event.\nIf our security measures are compromised, or if any of our websites are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members or customers to access our solutions, members and customers may curtail or stop use of our solutions.\nOur members provide us with information relevant to their professional networking and/or career-seeking experience with the option of having their information become public or remain private. If we experience compromises to our security that result in website performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, our members may lose trust and confidence in us, and will use our websites less often or stop using our websites entirely. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, members or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or our members\u2019 or customers\u2019 information. Because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these methods or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new members and increase engagement by existing members, cause existing members to close their accounts or existing customers to cancel their contracts, subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby materially and adversely affecting our reputation, our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe widespread adoption of different smart phones, smart phone operating systems and mobile applications, or apps, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our websites, applications and services.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including personal digital assistants, smart phones and handheld tablets or computers, has increased dramatically in the past few years and we believe this number will continue to increase. Each manufacturer or distributor of these devices may establish unique technical standards, and our services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Furthermore, as new devices and new platforms are continually released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such devices. Our websites are designed using responsive technology and are built to provide a positive user experience on a user\u2019s Internet device, whether a mobile phone, and tablet, laptop or personal computer. If we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with such devices, we might fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for our services.\nIf Internet search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our member engagement and number of members and users could decline.\nWe depend in part on various Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, to direct a significant amount of traffic to our websites. Our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our websites is not entirely within our control. Our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in an attempt to improve their search results, which could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our new user growth or in ways that make it harder for our members to use our websites, or if our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our member base could slow, member engagement could decrease, and we could lose existing members. These modifications may be prompted by search engine companies entering the online professional networking market or aligning with competitors. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites would materially harm our business and operating results. Our platform includes connectivity across the social graph, including websites such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter. If for any reason these websites discontinue or alter their current open platform policy it could have a negative impact on our user experience and our ability to compete in the same manner we do today.\nWireless communications providers may give their customers greater access to our competitors\u2019 websites.\nWireless communications providers may provide users of mobile devices greater access to websites that compete with our websites at more favorable rates or at faster download speeds. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Creation of an unequal playing field in terms of Internet access could significantly benefit larger and better capitalized companies competing with us.\nThe effect of significant declines in our ability to generate revenue may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue from sales of our hiring solutions over the life of a contract (typically 12 months) beginning the first month after the contract is signed. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from agreements entered into during previous quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in our ability to generate revenue may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nThe reported number of our registered users is higher than the number of actual individual users, and a substantial majority of our visits are generated by a minority of our users.\nThe reported number of members in our networks is higher than the number of actual individual members because some members have multiple registrations, other members have died or become incapacitated, and others may have registered under fictitious names. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members, and thus we rely on the number of members as our measure of the size of our networks. Further, a substantial majority of our members do not visit our websites on a monthly basis, and a substantial majority of our visits are generated by a minority of our members and users. If the number of our actual members does not meet our expectations or we are unable to increase the breadth and frequency of our visiting members, then our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe existing global economic and financial market environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business and operations.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity. Many companies hire fewer employees when economic activity is slow. Since the financial crisis in 2008, unemployment in the U.S. had increased and hiring activity had been limited. Although the economy has begun to recover and unemployment in the U.S. has improved, if the economy does not continue to recover or worsens, or unemployment returns to high levels, demand for our services and our revenue may be reduced. In addition, lower demand for our services may lead to lower prices for our services. The volatility in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if the economy does not fully recover or worsens, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy may fail as a result of changing social trends.\nOur business is dependent on the continuity of certain social trends, such as the increasing socialization of the Internet, the demographic trend towards women\u2019s career advancement, the growing ethnic diversity of the United States population and labor force, a regulatory environment that promotes diversity in the workplace, the growing ethnic population\u2019s spending power and the acceptance and growth of online recruitment and advertising. Some or all of these trends may change overtime. For example, increased privacy concerns may jeopardize the growth of online social and professional network websites. Furthermore, it is possible that people may not want to identify in online social or professional networks with a focus on diversity at all. Or alternatively, people who belong to more than one diversity group (such as Hispanic-American females, among others) may not be drawn to our websites, which singularly focus on one specific diversity group. Our strategy may fail as a result of these changing social trends, and if we do not timely adjust our strategy to adapt to changing social trends, we will lose members, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe regulatory environment favorable to promoting diversity in the workplace may change.\nFederal and state laws and regulations require certain companies engaged in business with governmental entities to report and promote diverse hiring practices. Repeal or modification of such laws and regulations could decrease the incentives for employers to actively seek diverse employee candidates through networks such as ours and materially affect our revenues.\nIf our member profiles are out-of-date, inaccurate or lack the information that users and customers want to see, we may not be able to realize the full potential of our networks, which could adversely impact our future growth.\nWe do not impose any selective or qualification criteria on membership and do not verify that any member of a particular Company website qualifies as a member of the ethnic, cultural or other group identified by that website. If our members do not update their information or provide accurate and complete information when they join our networks or do not establish sufficient connections, the value of our networks may be negatively impacted because our value proposition as diversity professional networks and as a source of accurate and comprehensive data will be weakened. For example, our hiring solutions customers may find that certain members misidentify their ethnic, national, cultural, racial, religious or gender classification, which could result in mismatches that erode customer confidence in our solutions. Similarly, incomplete or outdated member information would diminish the ability of our marketing solutions customers to reach their target audiences and our ability to provide research data to our customers. Therefore, we must provide features and products that demonstrate the value of our networks to our members and motivate them to add additional, timely and accurate information to their profile and our networks. If we fail to successfully motivate our members to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of members, enterprises and professional organizations, or our ability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe have developed strong brands, particularly \u201ciHispano\u201d and \u201cBlack Career Network,\u201d which we believe have contributed significantly in the success of our business. Additionally, we believe that Old NAPW developed a strong and trusted brand for the NAPW Network that we believe contributed significantly to the success of the NAPW Network prior to the Merger. That brand is predicated on the idea that professional women will trust it and find immense value in building and maintaining their professional identities and reputations on the NAPW Network platform. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing all of our brands is critical to expanding the base of members for the NAPW Network and PDN Network and increasing their engagement with the product and services offerings of the Company, and will depend largely on our ability to maintain member trust, be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality offerings, which we may not do successfully in the future. Despite our efforts to protect our brands and prevent their misuse, if others misuse any of our brands or pass themselves off as being endorsed or affiliated with the NAPW Network or the PDN Network, it could harm our reputation and our business could suffer. If members of any of our networks or potential members determine that they can use other platforms, such as social networks, for the same purposes as or as a replacement for the NAPW Network or the PDN Network, or if they choose to blend their professional and social networking activities, our brands and the business of the Company could be harmed. Members of any of our networks could find that new product or service offerings that are introduced are difficult to use or may feel that they degrade their experience with our organization, which could harm the reputation of the networks and the Company for delivering high-quality offerings. Our brands are also important in attracting and maintaining high performing employees. If we do not successfully maintain strong and trusted brands for our networks, our business can be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success. In particular, we must maintain, protect and enhance our brands. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. In the ordinary course, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information and customized technology platform. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Effective trademark, trade dress and domain names are expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We are seeking to protect our trademarks and domain names, a process that is expensive and may not be successful.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our brands. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation, enforcement actions and other legal obligations or liability related to data privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, store and process personal information and other member data, and we enable our members to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. There are numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other member data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and adhere to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties (including voluntary third-party certification bodies such as TRUSTe). We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other member data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our members and customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as customers, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our members\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.\nPublic scrutiny of Internet privacy issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could deter or prevent us from providing our current products and solutions to our members and customers, thereby materially harming our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain on-line tracking and targeted advertising practices. In addition, various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulations and changes in industry practices.\nOur business could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices or that require changes to these practices, the design of our websites, products, features or our privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by our ability to use the data that our members share with us in accordance with each of our website privacy policies and terms of use. Therefore, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of data our members choose to share with us, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our products and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products and features that make use of the data that our members voluntarily share with us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, including laws regarding data retention, privacy and consumer protection, which are continually evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. In addition, regulatory authorities are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws to which we may become subject. See the discussion included in \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d beginning on page 10 of this Annual Report.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could materially harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently party to litigation and may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and litigation which may costly to defend and could materially and adversely affect our business results or operating and financial condition.\nWe are currently party to litigation and may be party to additional lawsuits in the normal course of business. Results of the litigation to which we are a party cannot be predicted with certainty and there can be no assurance that this litigation will be resolved in our favor. These matters are described in more detail under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d Litigation in general is often expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. We may face in the future allegations and lawsuits that we have infringed the intellectual property and other rights of third parties, including patents, privacy, trademarks, copyrights and other rights. Litigation, particularly intellectual property and class action matters, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, require us to modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or require us to stop offering certain features.\nFrom time to time, we may face claims against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions, any of which could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nOur success depends in large part upon our management and key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain these individuals could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on our management and other key employees. The skills, knowledge and experience of our management team, are critical to the growth of our business. In particular, Ms. Star Jones, our President, provides significant leadership in the professional women\u2019s networking space that no other officer of the Company possesses. Our future performance will be dependent upon the continued successful service of members of our management and key employees. We do not maintain life insurance for any of the members of our management team or other key personnel. Competition for management in our industry is intense, and although we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our management team, we may not be able to retain our management and key personnel or attract and retain new management and key personnel in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently recorded impairment charges and may record additional impairment charges in future periods if we are required to record additional impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $25,113,000 with respect to NAPW Network\u2019s and PDN Network\u2019s goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2015. Under GAAP, the Merger with Old NAPW was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as a purchase by the Company of Old NAPW. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total implied purchase price paid for Old NAPW in the Merger was allocated to Old NAPW\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the Merger. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill. The Merger has resulted in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of acquisition accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets become impaired, the Company may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, such assets subject to an impairment test at least annually. Indicators such as underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in the Company\u2019s strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired. We may be required to record additional impairment charges if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired. Impairment charges have had a material adverse impact on our operating results this year. Such impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur significant stockholder and our directors and executive officers have substantial control over the Company and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nMatthew Proman the founder of NAPW Inc. and our former Chief Operating Officer, beneficially owned approximately 34.8% of our common stock as of March 30, 2016. As a result of his ownership Mr. Proman is able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors. In addition, our directors and executive officers and their affiliated entities, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 16.5% of our outstanding common stock. Stockholders other than these principal stockholders are therefore likely to have little influence on decisions regarding such matters. These stockholders may have interests that differ from yours, and they may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company and may affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership also limits the number of shares of stock likely to be traded in public markets and therefore will adversely affect liquidity in the trading of our common stock. This concentration of ownership of our common stock may also have the effect of influencing the completion of a change in control that may not necessarily be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nThe market price for our securities may be subject to wide fluctuations and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering at a price of $8.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $0.19 to $8.20 through March 30, 2016. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole or relating to companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue, operating results or key metrics, including our number of members and unique visitors;\n\u00b7\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners and our industry in general;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nadditional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders or the anticipation of such sales; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nThe securities of technology companies, especially Internet companies, have experienced wide fluctuations subsequent to their initial public offerings, including trading at prices below the initial public offering prices. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock include risk factors described in this section. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular industries or companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe eventual public resale by the former sole shareholder of Old NAPW and certain executive officers of Old NAPW of our common stock received in the Merger could have a negative effect on the trading price of the our common stock.\nIn the Merger, we issued 6,309,845 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, including 5,110,975 shares (the \u201cProman Block\u201d) to Mr. Matthew Proman, the sole shareholder of Old NAPW, and 1,198,870 to certain executive officers of Old NAPW. None of these shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933. These shares can only be resold pursuant to a separate registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration (under both federal and state securities laws). However, pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register such shares for sale in secondary public offerings by the holders of the shares. We are required to keep this registration statement effective for the earlier of three years or until each recipient of shares in the Merger has sold all of his or her shares.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement entered into between the Company and Mr. Proman in connection with Mr. Proman\u2019s resignation from his executive officer positions with the Company in July 2015, the Company will also register on any shelf registration statement under the Securities Act filed by the Company upon the expiration of the currently effective shelf registration statement (i) the resale of the Proman Block and (ii) the resale of the Company\u2019s stock underlying the warrants and options held by Mr. Proman. Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Proman also has a co-sale right with respect to Proman Block such that at any time that the Company proposes to sell shares of its common stock in a private placement or public offering, he would have the opportunity to participate in such sale by causing one of his Proman Block shares to be included in the sale with each share of common stock the Company proposes to sell, at the price per share at which the Company will be selling its shares. If all or a substantial portion of these shares are resold into the public markets, such transactions may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees, significant stockholders and recipients of shares issued in connection with the Merger with NAPW Inc., a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. For example, upon the sale by the Company of 1,670,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at $3.00 per share in April 2015 and the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 75,100 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at $3.00 per share in May 2015, the market price of our common stock declined from $4.85 on March 31, 2015 $2.29 on May 29, 2015. These shares were issued under a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on December 31, 2014 (as amended on March 31, 2015) and declared effective on April 2, 2015, which provides for the issuance of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, rights, warrants, units and debt securities up to an aggregate amount of $100,000,000 and the resale of up to 6,309,845 shares of our common stock originally issued to the former sole shareholder of Old NAPW and certain executive officers of Old NAPW.\nIn addition, in March 2015, we registered 500,000 shares of our common stock, reserved for providing equity incentives to employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2013 Equity Compensation Plan. Once acquired upon the exercise of the outstanding stock options or warrants, or vesting of restricted stock, these shares could be sold freely in the public market. For more information about our 2013 Equity Compensation Plan, please see Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u00b7\nthat our directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock, voting as a single class; and\n\u00b7\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose).\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, which could require us to restate financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have an adverse effect on our stock price or our debt ratings.\nOur management determined that as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting had a material weakness related to deficiencies in controls over the segregation of incompatible duties, the application of complex accounting principles and timely and complete financial statement reviews and procedures to ensure all required disclosures are made in our financial statements. During 2015, we undertook certain measures, including changes to our payroll processing procedures at PDN Network, to remediate material weaknesses related to our internal control over financial reporting that had been identified as of December 31, 2014. Specifically, we implemented new policies to further segregate incompatible duties and enhance the overall internal control structure. We also adopted additional procedures regarding authorized employees\u2019 access to different functions of the general ledger system. We hired additional finance personnel to improve our segregation of incompatible duties within our accounting and financial reporting functions, and engaged a third party external financial reporting specialist with expertise in GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. However, because many of the controls in the Company\u2019s system of internal controls rely extensively on manual review and approval, the successful operation of these controls is required for several quarters prior to management being able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. Accordingly, we have not yet been able to remediate the material weakness related to our internal control over financial reporting.\nAdditional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain existing or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to effectively remediate material weaknesses in a timely manner, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe will lose our \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status under the JOBS Act at the latest by the end of 2018, which will increase the costs and demands placed upon our management.\nWe will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation) or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under our initial public offering registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon our attaining a public float of at least $700 million. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements, particularly if our public float should exceed $75 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter in any fiscal year following our initial public offering, which would disqualify us as a smaller reporting company.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain that the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will not make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to smaller reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are companies which have a public float of less than $75 million. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company, we would be permitted to omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described above and are also exempt from the requirement to submit \u201csay-on-pay\u201d, \u201csay-on-pay frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-parachute\u201d votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will cease to be an emerging growth company at such time as described in the risk factor immediately above. Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.", "PERMNO": 13828, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "IPDN"}
