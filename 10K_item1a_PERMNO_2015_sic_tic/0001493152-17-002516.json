{"cik": "840715", "company": "CLEARONE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below. The risks described below are not the only ones we face and there are risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial that may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks could harm our business. The trading price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face intense competition in all markets for our products and services and our operating results will be adversely affected if we cannot compete effectively against other companies.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, pricing pressures and rapid technological change. Our competitive landscape continues to rapidly evolve, in particular with respect to our video-related services and products, as we move into new markets for video collaboration such as mobile, social and cloud-delivered video. We compete with businesses having substantially greater financial, research and product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than we do. If we are not able to continually design, manufacture, and successfully introduce new or enhanced products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by our competitors and at comparable or better prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales, gross profit margins, profits, and market share, each of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nDifficulties in estimating customer demand in our products segment could harm our profit margins.\nOrders from our distributors and other distribution participants are based on demand from end-users. Prospective end-user demand is difficult to measure. This means that our revenue during any fiscal quarter could be adversely impacted by low end-user demand, which could in turn negatively affect orders we receive from distributors and dealers. Our expectations for both short and long-term future net revenues are based on our own estimates of future demand. Revenue for any particular time period is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. We typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order; consequently, unshipped backlog has not historically been a good indicator of future revenue. We believe that the level of backlog is dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly. A significant portion of our customers\u2019 orders are received during the last month of the quarter. We budget the amount of our expenses based on our revenue estimates. If our estimates of sales are not accurate and we experience unforeseen variability in our revenue and operating results, we may be unable to adjust our expense levels accordingly and our gross profit and results of operations will be adversely affected. Higher inventory levels or stock shortages may also result from difficulties in estimating customer demand.\nOur sales depend to a certain extent on government funding and regulation.\nIn the audio conferencing products market, the revenue generated from sales of our audio conferencing products for distance learning and courtroom facilities depends on government funding. In the event government funding for such initiatives was reduced or became unavailable, our sales could be negatively impacted. Additionally, many of our products are subject to governmental regulations. New regulations could impact sales in a materially adverse manner.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant costs and impact on revenue.\nRegulations regarding the materials used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of electronic equipment and the efficient use of energy require us to take additional time to obtain regulatory approvals of new products in international markets. Such regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.\n\u250212\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by our continuing dependence on our distribution channels.\nWe market our products primarily through a network of distributors who in turn sell our products to value-added resellers. All of our agreements with such distributors and other distribution participants are non-exclusive, terminable at will by both party, and generally short-term. No assurances can be given that any or all such distributors or other distribution participants will continue their relationship with us. Distributors and, to a lesser extent, value-added resellers cannot easily be replaced and any loss of revenues from these and other sources or our inability to reduce expenses to compensate for such loss of revenue could adversely affect our net revenue and profit margins.\nAlthough we rely on our distribution channels to sell our products, our distributors and other distribution participants are not obligated to devote any specified amount of time, resources, or efforts to the marketing of our products, or to sell a specified number of our products. There are no prohibitions on distributors or other resellers offering products that are competitive with our products, and some do offer competitive products. The support of our products by distributors and other distribution participants may depend on the competitive strength of our products and the price incentives we offer for their support. If our distributors and other distribution participants are not committed to our products, our revenue and profit margins may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we offer our distributors price protection on their inventory of our products. If we reduce the list price of our products, we will compensate our distributors for the respective products that remain in their inventory on the date the price adjustment becomes effective, provided that they have been providing inventory reports consistently and the inventory was bought within the six months preceding the price adjustment date. Our net revenue and profit margins could be adversely affected if we reduce product prices significantly or distributors happen to have significant on-hand inventory of the affected product at the time of a price reduction. Further, if we do not have sufficient cash resources to compensate distributors on terms satisfactory to them or us, our price protection obligations may prevent us from reacting quickly to changing market conditions.\nProduct development delays or defects could harm our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe have in the past experienced, and may again experience, technical difficulties and delays with the development and introduction of new products. Many of the products we develop contain sophisticated and complicated circuitry, software and components and utilize manufacturing techniques involving new technologies. Potential difficulties in the development process that we may experience include the following: (a) meeting required specifications and regulatory standards; (b) hiring and keeping a sufficient number of skilled developers; (c) meeting market expectations for performance; (d) obtaining prototype products at anticipated cost levels; (e) having the ability to identify problems or product defects in the development cycle; and (f) achieving necessary manufacturing efficiencies.\nOnce new products reach the market, they may have defects, or may be met by unanticipated new competitive products, which could adversely affect market acceptance of these products and our reputation. If we are not able to manage and minimize such potential difficulties, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on reporting of distribution channel inventory by our distributors to recognize revenue from product sales to them, which could turn out to be inaccurate.\nWe defer recognition of revenue from product sales to distributors until the return privilege has expired, which approximates when product is sold-through to customers of our distributors. At each quarter-end, we evaluate the inventory in the channel through information provided by our distributors. We use this information to determine the amount of inventory in the channel, and the appropriate revenue and cost of goods sold associated with those channel products. We cannot guarantee that the third party data as reported will be accurate. We sample test the inventory of a limited number of distributors on an annual basis, most recently in the fourth quarter of 2016, to gain a comfort level of inventory levels reported, however, inventory levels could contain inaccuracies for items we do not sample.\n\u250213\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nWe depend on an outsourced manufacturing strategy, and any disruption in outsourced services could negatively impact our product availability and revenues.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of all of our products except digital signage and wireless microphone products to electronics manufacturing services (\u201cEMS\u201d) providers located in both the U.S. and Asia. If any of these EMS providers experience (i) difficulties in obtaining sufficient supplies of components, (ii) component prices significantly exceeding anticipated costs, (iii) an interruption in their operations, or (iv) otherwise suffers capacity constraints, we could experience a delay in production and shipping of these products, which would have a negative impact on our revenue. Should there be any disruption in services due to natural disaster, economic or political difficulties, transportation restrictions, acts of terror, quarantines or other restrictions associated with infectious diseases, or other similar events, or any other reason, such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. Operating in the international outsourcing environment exposes us to certain inherent risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs, and potentially adverse tax consequences, which could materially affect our results of operations. Currently, we have no second source of manufacturing for a portion of our products.\nSwitching from one EMS provider to another is an expensive, difficult and a time consuming process, with serious risks to our ability to successfully transfer our manufacturing operations. Our operations, and consequently our revenues and profitability, could be materially adversely affected if we are forced to switch from any of our EMS providers to another EMS provider due to any of a number of factors, including financial difficulties faced by the manufacturer, disagreements in pricing negotiations between us and the manufacturer or organizational changes in the manufacturer.\nThe cost of delivered product from our EMS providers is a direct function of their ability to buy components at a competitive price and to realize efficiencies and economies of scale within their overall business structures. If they are unsuccessful in driving efficient cost models, our delivered costs could rise, affecting our profitability and ability to compete. In addition, if the EMS providers are unable to achieve greater operational efficiencies, delivery schedules for new product development and current product delivery could be negatively impacted.\nRecent regulatory requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials to our EMS providers in the manufacture of certain of our products. We may be subject to costs associated with the new regulations, including for the diligence pertaining to the presence of any conflict minerals used in our products and the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The impact of the regulations may result in a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free minerals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities, at competitive prices, or at all. We may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the metals used in the products we sell. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture our products, which could force us to cease production or search for alternative supply sources, possibly at a higher cost. Such disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGlobal economic conditions have adversely affected our business in the past and could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business in the future.\nAdverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications industry and have caused a negative impact on the specific segments and markets in which we operate. Adverse changes in general global economic conditions can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end-user customers for our products, longer sales cycles, the deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition. These factors have adversely impacted our operating results in prior periods and could also impact us again in the future. Global economic concerns, such as the varying pace of global economic recovery, European and domestic debt and budget issues, the slowdown in economic growth in large emerging markets such as China and India, and international currency fluctuations, may continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability in the global and national economy. A global economic downturn would negatively impact technology spending for our products and services and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, global economic conditions may result in a tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity levels in many financial markets, decrease in customer demand and ability to pay obligations, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, foreign currency and fixed income markets.\n\u250214\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSuch adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our business, particularly our revenue potential, potentially causing losses on investments and the collectability of our accounts receivable. These factors potentially include: the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, customer or partner insolvencies or bankruptcies, decreased customer confidence to make purchasing decisions resulting in delays in their purchasing decisions, decreased customer demand or demand for lower-end products, or decreased customer ability to pay their obligations when they become due to us.\nWe are a smaller Company than some of our competitors and may be more susceptible to market fluctuations, other adverse events, increased costs and less favorable purchasing terms.\nSince we are a relatively small Company, there is a risk that we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events. In particular, we may be more susceptible to reductions in government and corporate spending from our government and enterprise customers. We may also experience increased costs and less favorable terms from our suppliers than some of our larger competitors who may have greater leverage in their purchasing spend. Any of these outcomes could result in loss of sales or our products being more costly to manufacture and thus less competitive. Any such unfavorable market fluctuations, reductions in customer spending or increased manufacturing costs could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nDifficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business.\nAny acquisition involves numerous risks and challenges, including difficulties and time involved in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, entering new business or product lines, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, geographic dispersion of operations, generating market demand for expanded product lines and the potential loss of key customers or employees of an acquired Company. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these and any future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of these or any other companies or assets we acquire, could also harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will not incur material charges in future periods to reflect additional costs associated with these acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make.\nProfitability could be negatively impacted if we do not adequately forecast the demand for our products and are unable to monetize our long-term inventories.\nWe hold approximately $1.7 million in long-term inventories. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not successfully monetize our long-term inventory. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability.\nConditions in Israel and the Middle East may affect the operations of our subsidiary in Israel.\nWe have formed a subsidiary located in Israel in connection with the acquisition of the assets of VCON Video Conferencing, Ltd. Political, economic, security and military conditions in the Middle East in general, and in Israel in particular, directly affect our Israeli subsidiary\u2019s operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Despite negotiations to effect peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the future of these peace efforts is uncertain.\nRecent social unrest in various countries in the Middle East have led to severe political instability in those countries. This continuing instability may lead to deterioration of the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel and these countries. In addition, this instability may affect the economy in the Middle East as well as the global economy and marketplace. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region, including acts of terrorism or any other hostilities involving or threatening Israel, would likely negatively affect business conditions and could make it more difficult for us to conduct our operations in Israel, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results.\n\u250215\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nProduct obsolescence could harm demand for our products and could adversely affect our revenue and our results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to technological innovations that could render existing technologies in our products obsolete and thereby decrease market demand for such products. If any of our products becomes slow-moving or obsolete and the recorded value of our inventory is greater than its market value, we will be required to write down the value of our inventory to its fair market value, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In limited circumstances, we are required to purchase components that our outsourced manufacturers use to produce and assemble our products. Should technological innovations render these components obsolete, we will be required to write down the value of this inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or have insufficient proprietary rights, our business would be materially impaired.\nWe currently rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, patents pending, and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. Our success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property legal protection covering our products, then no assurances can be given that others will not independently develop technologies similar to ours, or duplicate or design around aspects of our technology. In addition, we cannot assure that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. Costly litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. We believe our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon any proprietary rights of third parties; however, we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future. In addition, we may initiate litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which may prompt our adversaries in such litigation to challenge the validity, scope or enforceability of our intellectual property. Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection of intellectual property rights. Such claims and the resulting litigation can be expensive and could divert our attention, regardless of the merit of such claims. In the event of a successful claim, we might be required to license third-party technology or redesign our products, which may not be possible or economically feasible.\nWe currently hold only a limited number of patents. To the extent that we have patentable technology that is material to our business and for which we have not filed patent applications, others may be able to use such technology or even gain priority over us by patenting such technology themselves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. With respect to any patent application we have filed, we cannot ensure that a patent will be awarded.\nInternational sales account for a significant portion of our net revenue and risks inherent in international sales could harm our business.\nInternational sales represent a significant portion of our total product revenue. We anticipate that the portion of our total product revenue from international sales will continue to increase as we further enhance our focus on developing new products for new markets, establishing new distribution partners, strengthening our presence in emerging economies, and improving product localization with country-specific product documentation and marketing materials. Our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally, including the following:\n\u250216\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\n\u25cf unexpected changes in, or the imposition of, additional legislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf unique or more onerous environmental regulations;\n\u25cf fluctuating exchange rates;\n\u25cf tariffs and other barriers;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations;\n\u25cf import and export restrictions;\n\u25cf greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u25cf disruption in services due to natural disaster, economic or political difficulties, transportation, quarantines or other restrictions associated with infectious diseases.\nWe may not be able to hire and retain qualified key and highly-skilled technical employees, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and may cause our revenue and profitability to decline.\nWe depend on our ability to hire and retain qualified key and highly skilled employees to manage, research and develop, market, and service new and existing products. Competition for such key and highly-skilled employees is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. To succeed, we must hire and retain employees who are highly skilled in the rapidly changing communications and Internet technologies. Individuals who have the skills and can perform the services we need to provide our products and services are in great demand. Because the competition for qualified employees in our industry is intense, hiring and retaining employees with the skills we need is both time-consuming and expensive. We may not be able to hire enough skilled employees or retain the employees we do hire. In addition, provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the SEC impose heightened personal liability on some of our key employees. The threat of such liability could make it more difficult to identify, hire and retain qualified key and highly-skilled employees. We have relied on our ability to grant stock options as a means of recruiting and retaining key employees. Accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair our future ability to provide these incentives without incurring associated compensation costs. If we are unable to hire and retain employees with the skills we seek, our ability to sell our existing products, systems, or services or to develop new products, systems, or services could be hindered with a consequent adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In addition, given the current political climate regarding the U.S. immigration laws, we may not be able attract highly-skilled technical employees from abroad.\nWe rely on third-party technology and license agreements, the loss of any of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software and hardware incorporated into our products. These third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays of current product shipments or delays or reductions in new product introductions until equivalent designs can be developed, licensed, and integrated, if at all possible, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have difficulty in collecting outstanding receivables.\nWe grant credit to substantially all of our customers without requiring collateral. In times of economic uncertainty, the risks relating to the granting of such credit will typically increase. Although we monitor and mitigate the risks associated with our credit policies, we cannot ensure that such mitigation will be effective. We have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations. Future losses could be significant and, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\n\u250217\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInterruptions to our business could adversely affect our operations.\nAs with any Company, our operations are at risk of being interrupted by earthquake, fire, flood, and other natural and human-caused disasters, including disease and terrorist attacks. Our operations are also at risk of power loss, telecommunications failure, human error, physical or electronic security breaches and computer viruses (which could leave us vulnerable to the loss of confidential proprietary information as well as disruption of our business activities) and other infrastructure and technology based problems. To help guard against such risks, we carry business interruption loss insurance to help compensate us for losses that may occur, but we cannot assure that such coverage would protect us from all such possible losses.\nWe may become subject to adverse determinations with respect to certain legal claims.\nOn or about October 24, 2016, we received written notice from the United States Department of Labor, Occupational Health and Safety Administration (\"OSHA\") that a complaint had been filed against the Company by a former employee. Among other things, the complaint to OSHA alleges harassment, retaliation, and violations of 18 U.S.C.A. Section 1514A, et seq. (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") arising out of allegations previously made by the employee and the termination of the person\u2019s employment with the Company on or about August 17, 2016 (the \u201cOSHA Complaint\u201d). The Company denies the allegations in the OSHA Complaint, has not discovered any evidence of wrongdoing with respect to the allegations previously made by the former employee, and is vigorously defending the claims. As of February 28, 2017, we have incurred approximately $927,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs relating to the OSHA Complaint. On March 2, 2017, the Company received notice that the same former employee who initiated the OSHA Complaint also has filed a complaint with the Utah Labor Commission, Anti-Discrimination & Labor Division (the \u201cUtah Complaint\u201d) alleging that the employee's termination was discriminatory based upon a disability or, in the alternative, retaliatory for substantially the same reasons alleged in the OSHA Complaint. The Company is in the process of assessing the Utah Complaint and intends to vigorously defend it. We may incur additional expenses related to legal and related services rendered in connection with these matters and/or related matters in future periods and will recognize these expenses when they are incurred. Expenses related to the defense of the OSHA Complaint, the Utah Complaint and/or related matters may include uncertain but potential liabilities from any future unspecified governmental investigations and/or proceedings; any future unspecified civil litigation; and future unspecified expenses. We have not accrued any amount for contingent liability with respect to this matter. Due to the uncertainty and expense of litigation, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes which are neither predictable nor estimable at this time. An adverse outcome with respect to the OSHA Complaint, the Utah Complaint and/or the allegations set forth therein could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.\nChanges in our tax rates could adversely affect our future results.\nWe are a U.S. based Company subject to tax in U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates, which are difficult to predict, could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Further, the accounting for stock compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718 and uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 could result in more unpredictability and variability to our future effective tax rates.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our employees, customers, licensors, vendors and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Security breaches have occurred with increased frequency and sophistication in recent years. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u250218\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Share Ownership\nOur stock price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market fluctuations.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf statements or changes in opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically;\n\u25cf disparity between our reported results and the projections of analysts;\n\u25cf the shift in sales mix of products that we currently sell to a sales mix of lower-gross profit product offerings;\n\u25cf the level and mix of inventory held by our distributors;\n\u25cf the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf success in meeting targeted availability dates for new or redesigned products;\n\u25cf the ability to profitably and efficiently manage our supply of products and key components;\n\u25cf the ability to maintain profitable relationships with our customers;\n\u25cf the ability to maintain an appropriate cost structure;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf general consumer confidence or market conditions, or market conditions specific to technology industry;\n\u25cf domestic and international economic conditions;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u25cf our ability to report financial information in a timely manner;\n\u25cf the markets in which our stock is traded;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate the companies we have acquired; and\n\u25cf our ability to successfully utilize our cash reserves resulting from the settlement of litigation and arbitration matters.\nRights to acquire our common stock could result in dilution to other holders of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding options to acquire approximately 0.85 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $8.06 per share. During the terms of these options, the holders thereof will have the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the common stock. The existence of these options may adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional financing, and the holders of these options can be expected to exercise such options at a time when we, in all likelihood, would be able to obtain additional capital by offering shares of our common stock on terms more favorable to us than those provided by the exercise of these options.\nThe sale of additional shares of our common stock could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. Most shares of common stock currently outstanding are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144 under the securities laws. Shares issued upon the exercise of stock options granted under our stock option plan generally will be eligible for sale in the public market. We also have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The issuance of such shares could dilute the voting power of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock and could dilute earnings per share.\n\u250219\u2502\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Further, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. Any future failure of our own internal controls or the internal controls at any of our outsourced manufacturers or partners could result in reported material weaknesses. In addition, our control framework may suffer if we are unable to adapt our control framework appropriately as we continue to grow our business. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting period that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our stock price, market capitalization, results of operations or financial position or other adverse consequences.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe liquidity of the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control the opinions of these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\n\u250220\u2502", "PERMNO": 75714, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "CLRO"}
