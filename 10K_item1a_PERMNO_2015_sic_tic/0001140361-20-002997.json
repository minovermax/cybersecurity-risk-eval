{"cik": "1021561", "company": "NU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face a number of substantial risks. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, which should be considered together with the other items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nChallenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding the form of our network marketing system. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by government agencies or courts can change.\nRecent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims, problematic compensation structures and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. Any adverse rulings or legal actions could impact our business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example:\n\u25cf In 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims.\n\u25cf In 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance.\n\u25cf In September 2019, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and compensation structure and inappropriate earnings claims. The company agreed to a prohibition from engaging in multi-level marketing. The FTC and another multi-level company are currently in litigation, and that company has indicated the FTC is seeking to limit the levels of payment in its compensation structure as a condition to settlement.\nAlthough we take steps to educate our distributors on proper claims, if our distributors make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business. In addition, if the requirements in the actions listed above lead to new industry standards or new rules, or if they limit the levels in the network for which payments can be made, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail customers, preferred customers, and distributors who have never sponsored other distributors, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.\nWe could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of civil actions against other direct-selling companies in the United States, that have, and may in the future, resulted in significant settlements. Allegations by short sellers directed at us and our competitors regarding the legality of multi-level marketing in various markets and adverse media reports have also created intense public scrutiny of us and our industry. Our business has also been subject to formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities in the past regarding our business and our compliance with local laws and regulations. All of these actions and any future scrutiny of us or our industry could generate negative publicity or further regulatory actions that could result in fines, restrict our ability to conduct our business in our various markets, enter into new markets, motivate our sales force and attract consumers.\nAdverse publicity concerning our business, marketing plan, products or people could harm our business and reputation.\nGrowth in our sales force and consumers and our results of operations can be particularly impacted by adverse publicity regarding us, the nature of our direct selling business models, our products or the actions of our sales force and employees. Given the nature of our operations, lack of clarity on applicable legal requirements and standards, and our continuous need to recruit and retain consumers and members of our sales force, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse publicity. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse publicity concerning:\n\u25cf suspicions about the legality and ethics of network marketing;\n\u25cf continued media or regulatory scrutiny regarding our business and our business model, including in Mainland China;\n\u25cf the safety or effectiveness of our or our competitors\u2019 products or the ingredients in such products;\n\u25cf inquiries, investigations, fines, legal actions, or mandatory or voluntary product recalls involving us, our competitors, our business models or our respective products;\n\u25cf the actions of our current or former sales force and employees, including any allegations that our sales force or employees have overstated or made false product claims or earnings representations, or engaged in unethical or illegal activity;\n\u25cf misperceptions about the types and magnitude of economic benefits offered at different levels of sales engagement in our business; and\n\u25cf public, governmental or media perceptions of the direct selling, nutritional supplement or personal care industries generally.\nThese issues have previously resulted in negative publicity and have harmed our business. For example, we believe that negative media stories in Mainland China regarding improper claims and in Europe regarding claims and activities by our sales force negatively impacted our results. Critics of our industry, short sellers and other individuals have in the past and may in the future utilize the internet, the press and other means to publish criticisms of the industry, our company and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. In some cases, such adverse publicity or allegations can lead to government and regulatory scrutiny. We continue to see increased adverse publicity regarding the direct selling and healthcare products industries. We or others in our industry may receive similar negative publicity or allegations in the future, and it may harm our business and reputation.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government scrutiny, and we could be subject to fines or other penalties.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. The legal system in Mainland China provides government authorities broad latitude to conduct investigations, and many Chinese regulations, including those governing our business, are subject to significant interpretation, which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Because of significant government concerns in Mainland China regarding improper direct selling activities, government regulators closely scrutinize activities of direct selling companies and activities that resemble direct selling. The government in Mainland China continues to inspect and interview companies in the direct selling industry on a regular basis, which has and may continue to increase regulatory scrutiny of the industry and our business.\nInitially as a result of negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by another direct selling company in Mainland China, the government\u2019s scrutiny of activities within the health products and direct selling industries was during 2019 and continues to be at higher levels. During this time, we have been receiving and addressing an increased number of government reviews, inspections, and inquiries and consumer complaints in Mainland China; our ability to hold certain business meetings has been limited; and negative media coverage has spread to include additional companies, including ours.\nGovernment regulators frequently make inquiries into our business activities and investigate complaints from consumers and others regarding our business. Some of these inquiries and investigations in the past have resulted in the payment of fines by us or members of our sales force, interruption of sales activities at stores and warnings. Any determination by government regulators in these inquiries or investigations that our operations or activities, or the activities of our sales employees, independent direct sellers or independent marketers, are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, and termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling and other licenses, all of which could harm our business.\nWe train our sales force in Mainland China on how our Mainland China business model differs from our global business model. However, Sales Leaders in Mainland China may attend regional and global events or interact with Sales Leaders from other markets. Although our global model and Mainland China business model differ, mistakes may be made as to how those working in Mainland China should promote the business in Mainland China. These mistakes by our sales force, or allegations of such mistakes, have, and may in the future, led to government reviews and investigations of our operations in Mainland China. For example, in 2014, a series of articles was published in Mainland China containing a number of allegations, including, among other things, that our compensation practices violated Chinese regulations against pyramid and multi-level sales models, that our recruiting and training techniques were unlawful or inappropriate and that certain of our sales force in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. As a result of these allegations, in 2014 Chinese regulators conducted a review of our business model and operations in Mainland China. Such reviews and investigations, as well as the adverse publicity, reputational harm and adjustments to our operations that could accompany them, has and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. In addition, media scrutiny could result in further regulatory scrutiny and investigations in Mainland China and could negatively impact our revenue, sales force and business in this market, including the interruption of sales activities, loss of licenses, and the imposition of fines, and any other adverse actions or events.\nIf direct selling regulations in Mainland China are modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to our business model or the imposition of a range of potential penalties, our business would be significantly negatively impacted.\nThe government of Mainland China has adopted direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that impose significant restrictions and limitations on businesses in our industry. Most notably, the regulations prohibit multi-level compensation, which is the basis of how we compensate our sales force outside of Mainland China. The regulations also prohibit overseas personnel from participating in direct selling in Mainland China. We have structured our business model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations. In Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; independent direct sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have a direct selling license and a service center and can also sell through our website; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We generally compensate our Sales Leaders at a level that is competitive with other direct selling companies in the market and reflective of the compensation of our Sales Leaders globally.\nThe nature of the political, regulatory and legal systems in Mainland China gives regulatory agencies at both the local and central levels of government broad discretion to interpret and enforce regulations as they deem appropriate to promote social stability. We face a risk that regulators may change the way in which they currently interpret and enforce the direct selling regulations, or that such regulations may be modified. If our business practices are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, in particular our use of the sales productivity of a Sales Leader and the sales representatives that such Sales Leader trains, collaborates with, supports and services in setting his/her salary or service fee on a quarterly basis, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, either of which could significantly harm our business.\nIn January 2019, the Mainland China government announced a 100-day campaign to review and inspect the health products and direct selling industries. This campaign involved a number of regulatory agencies. Although the 100-day period has ended, there has continued to be a heightened level of media and regulatory scrutiny of these industries and of our business and products. There is also uncertainty whether any changes to the regulations that apply to these industries will be made based on the review. If changes are made to any of the regulations that apply to our business model, products or operations, our business could be harmed.\nEpidemics, including the recent outbreak of coronavirus, and other crises could negatively impact our business.\nDue to the person-to-person nature of direct selling, our results of operations could be harmed if the fear of a communicable and rapidly spreading disease or other crises such as natural disasters result in travel restrictions or cause people to avoid group meetings or gatherings or interaction with other people. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises. We currently anticipate that the outbreak of the coronavirus, meeting restrictions and many people\u2019s hesitance to go to public places in response to this outbreak, and travel restrictions and quarantines that the Mainland China government and other governments are instituting, will have a significant negative impact on our business in that market and possibly other markets.\nIn addition, most of our nutritional supplement revenue is generated from products that are encapsulated in bovine- and/or porcine-sourced gel capsules. If we experience production difficulties, quality control problems or shortages in supply in connection with bovine or porcine related health concerns, this could result in additional risk of product shortages or write-downs of inventory. We may be unable to introduce our products in some markets if we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or if any product ingredients are prohibited, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to expand our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain additional necessary national and local government approvals in Mainland China.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we have obtained direct selling licenses in 37 cities in 25 provinces and municipalities in Mainland China. To expand our direct selling model into additional provinces, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from district, city, provincial and national government agencies with respect to each province in which we wish to expand. The process for obtaining the necessary government approvals to conduct direct selling continues to evolve and is lengthy, as we are required to work with a large number of provincial, city, district and national government authorities. The complexity of the approval process as well as the government\u2019s continued cautious approach as direct selling develops in Mainland China makes it difficult to predict the timeline for obtaining these approvals. Furthermore, any media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China could increase the time and difficulty we may face in obtaining additional licenses. If media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China results in significant delays in obtaining licenses elsewhere in Mainland China, or if the current processes for obtaining approvals are delayed further for any reason or are changed or interpreted differently than currently understood, our ability to receive direct selling licenses in Mainland China and our growth prospects in this market, could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, our business could be harmed.\nWe face lengthy timelines with respect to product registrations in Mainland China. The process for obtaining product permits and licenses may require extended periods of time that may prevent us from launching new product initiatives in Mainland China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in Mainland China as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and with a few exceptions, the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. If the recent media and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry results in more burdensome regulations related to product registration, we may have more difficulty getting new nutritional products registered for sale in Mainland China. We market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, we could be prohibited or limited in marketing such products in Mainland China in their current form.\nAs we expand our direct selling channel, we face additional product marketing restrictions compared to our retail store channel. Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, we can only register products for direct selling if we manufacture them and if they fall within categories that are authorized for direct selling, such as cosmetics, cleaning supplies, health foods, healthcare devices, small kitchen utensils and household appliances. Products that are not categorized as direct selling products and products that are manufactured by third parties are prohibited from marketing or selling through our direct sales channel. If we cannot successfully manufacture our own direct selling products, we will not be able to sell these products through the direct sales channel. Any marketing and sale of non-direct selling products by our independent direct sellers could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us.\nRecently enacted tariffs, other potential changes to tariff and import/export regulations, and ongoing trade disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\nThe United States has proposed and enacted additional tariffs on certain items. Further, there have been ongoing discussions and activities regarding changes to other U.S. trade policies and treaties. In response, a number of our markets, including Mainland China, have indicated that they may impose tariffs on imports of U.S. goods, or have already implemented tariffs on imports of U.S. goods, or they may take other measures in response to these U.S. actions. These developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and they may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between Mainland China and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, create anti-American consumer sentiment, restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actions by foreign markets to implement further trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory scrutiny or taking other actions which impact U.S. companies\u2019 ability to obtain necessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business.\nTariff discussions between the United States and its trading partners are ongoing and fluid. Any additional tariffs are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented, including future adjustments and changes to the products covered by additional tariffs and to the countries included or excluded from such tariffs. The ultimate reaction of other countries, and the individuals in each of these countries, and the impact of these tariffs or other actions on the United States, Mainland China, the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time, nor can we predict the impact of any other developments with respect to global trade.\nInability of products and other initiatives to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance could harm our business.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if our products, business opportunities and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic benefit to retain our existing consumers and sales force or to attract new consumers and people interested in joining our sales force. Potential factors affecting the attractiveness of our products, business opportunities and other initiatives include, among other items, perceived product quality and value, product exclusivity or effectiveness, economic success in our business opportunity, restrictions in social or digital media for sharing products and attracting consumers, adverse media attention or regulatory restrictions on claims.\nIn addition, our ability to develop and introduce new products could be impacted by, among other items, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, intellectual property of competitors that may limit our ability to offer innovative products or that challenge our own intellectual property, or problems related to manufacturing or quality control, and difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if our products fail to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance.\nIn addition, in our more mature markets, one of the challenges we face is keeping Sales Leaders with established businesses and high-income levels motivated and actively engaged in business building activities and in developing new Sales Leaders. We may also face challenges retaining our sales force as the population of our markets transitions to a new, millennial demographic, with its associated new and different dynamics of loyalty. Many millennials are particularly savvy with social sharing across multiple business opportunity platforms. There can be no assurance that our initiatives will continue to generate excitement among our sales force in the long term or that planned initiatives will be successful in maintaining sales force activity and productivity or in motivating Sales Leaders to remain engaged in business building and developing new Sales Leaders. Some initiatives may have unanticipated negative impacts on our sales force, particularly changes to our sales compensation plans. The introduction of a new product or key initiative can also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our Sales Leaders focus their efforts on the new product or initiative. In addition, if any of our products fails to gain acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns.\nForeign-currency fluctuations and inflation in foreign markets could impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn 2019, approximately 87% of our sales occurred in markets outside of the United States in each market\u2019s respective local currency. We purchase inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenue and expenses in our markets outside the United States from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, our reported revenue, gross profit and net income will likely be reduced. Foreign-currency fluctuations can also cause losses and gains resulting from translation of foreign-currency-denominated balances on our balance sheet.\nIn addition, high levels of inflation and currency devaluations in any of our markets could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in our net earnings. For example, during 2015 and 2014, we recorded $10.2 million and $46.3 million, respectively, of non-cash foreign-currency charges related to the devaluation of the Venezuela currency after Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. During the third quarter of 2016, we ceased business operations in Venezuela. During 2018, Argentina also was designated as a highly inflationary economy; accordingly, beginning with the third quarter of 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentina operations, which has resulted in additional foreign-currency charges. Other markets may be designated as highly inflationary economies in the future, which could result in further foreign-currency charges.\nAlthough we may engage in transactions intended to reduce our exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be effective. Complex global political and economic dynamics can affect exchange rate fluctuations. For example, significant foreign-currency fluctuations occurred as a result of the 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom in which voters approved an exit from the European Union. Rules related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation also could affect foreign-currency fluctuations. In addition, members of the current U.S. presidential administration have expressed antipathy toward some international trade agreements and have begun to implement or have suggested the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures that could impact the level of trade between the United States and other markets. Any such proposal or measure could impact the value of the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict future fluctuations and the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results or our overall financial condition.\nDifficult economic conditions could harm our business.\nDifficult economic conditions could adversely affect our business by causing a decline in demand for our products, particularly if the economic conditions are prolonged or worsen. In addition, such economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease the ability of our sales force and consumers to obtain or maintain credit cards, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition.\nTransition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate could have an adverse effect on our overall financial position.\nOur indebtedness levels and the required payments on such indebtedness may be impacted by expected reforms related to LIBOR. The variable interest rates payable under our credit facility are linked to LIBOR as the benchmark for establishing such rates. Recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform proposals regarding LIBOR are expected to ultimately cause LIBOR to be discontinued or become unavailable as a benchmark rate. Although our credit facility includes mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of LIBOR, no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to LIBOR and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had LIBOR remained in effect.\nImproper sales force actions could harm our business.\nSales force activities that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third-party actions against us, which could harm our business.\nFor example, in 2014, allegations were made by various media outlets that certain of our sales representatives in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. In response to these and other allegations, Chinese regulators commenced a review of our business in Mainland China. In response to this media scrutiny and government review, we voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies. The adverse publicity and suspension of business meetings and acceptance of applications had a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. Similar or more extreme actions by government agencies in Mainland China in the future could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe direct selling industry in Japan continues to experience regulatory and media scrutiny, and other direct selling companies have been suspended from sponsoring activities in the past. Japan imposes strict requirements regarding how distributors approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive warnings from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our distributors. As a result, we continually evaluate and enhance our distributor compliance, education and training efforts in Japan. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will successfully prevent regulatory actions against us, including fines, suspensions or other sanctions, or that the company and the direct selling industry will not receive further negative media attention, all of which could harm our business.\nExcept in Mainland China, members of our sales force are not employees and act independently of us. The most significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of joining our sales force. We implement strict policies and procedures to ensure our sales force complies with legal requirements. However, given the size of our sales force, we experience problems from time to time. For example, product claims made by some of our sales force in 1990 and 1991 led to a United States Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) investigation that resulted in our entering into a consent agreement with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. In addition, rulings by the South Korean Federal Trade Commission and by judicial authorities against us and other companies in South Korea indicate that, if our sales force engages in criminal activity, we may be held liable or penalized for failure to supervise them adequately. Our sales force may attempt to anticipate which markets we will open in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines, suspensions or other legal action if our sales force violates applicable laws and regulations, and our reputation and brand could be negatively impacted.\nWe have also seen an increase in the use of social media by our sales force to promote our business opportunity and products, which increases the burden on us to monitor compliance of such activities and increases the risk that such social media content could contain problematic claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. In addition, social media platforms could decide to block, or decrease the prominence of, our sales force\u2019s content for any reason, including if our sales force violates the social media platform\u2019s policies.\nIf our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable local regulations regarding foreigners, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation of foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies. If our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could result in adverse publicity and significantly harm our business.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing sales force and recruit additional people to join our sales force, our revenue will not increase and may even decline.\nOur products are primarily marketed by our sales force, and we depend on them to generate virtually all of our revenue. Our sales force may terminate their services at any time, and like most direct selling companies, we experience high turnover among our sales force from year to year. People who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short-term income goals frequently only stay with us for a short time. Sales Leaders who have committed time and effort to build a sales organization will generally stay for longer periods. To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of and/or the productivity of our sales force.\nWe have experienced periodic fluctuations in both Sales Leaders and Customers in the past and could experience such fluctuations again in the future. For example, our Sales Leaders in Mainland China declined 46% from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 due to such factors as meeting restrictions and negative media scrutiny, as discussed in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our ability to retain our Sales Leaders and Customers could be affected as our sales force makes increased use of social sharing channels, which may allow them to more easily engage their consumers and sales network in other opportunities. If our initiatives do not drive growth in both Sales Leaders and Customers, our operating results could be harmed. While we take many steps to help train, motivate and retain our sales force, we cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our sales force may fluctuate because we rely primarily upon our Sales Leaders to find new consumers, and to find, train and develop new Sales Leaders. Our operating results could be harmed if we and our Sales Leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business and its products to retain and motivate our existing sales force and attract new people to join our sales force.\nThe number and productivity of our sales force could be negatively impacted by several additional factors, including:\n\u25cf any adverse publicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channel, or our competitors;\n\u25cf lack of interest in, dissatisfaction with, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n\u25cf lack of compelling products or income opportunities, including through our sales compensation plans and other incentive trips and offerings;\n\u25cf negative sales force reaction to changes in our sales compensation plans;\n\u25cf any negative public perception of our products and their ingredients;\n\u25cf any negative public perception of our sales force and direct selling businesses in general;\n\u25cf our actions to enforce our policies and procedures;\n\u25cf any regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry;\n\u25cf general economic and business conditions, including employment levels and employment trends such as the gig and sharing economies;\n\u25cf recruiting efforts of our competitors; and\n\u25cf potential saturation or maturity levels in a given market, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our sales force in such market.\nThe loss of key Sales Leaders could negatively impact our growth and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a global network of 1,162,905 Customers. Approximately 54,760 of our Customers were Sales Leaders. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 390 Sales Leaders occupied the highest levels under our global sales compensation plan, and in Mainland China we have approximately 320 key Sales Leaders who play a significant role in managing, training and servicing our sales force in that market and driving sales. We rely on these Sales Leaders for substantially all of our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level or key Sales Leader or a group of leading Sales Leaders, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our growth and our revenue.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to execute our product launch process or ongoing product sales due to difficulty in forecasting or increased pressure on our supply chain, information systems and management.\nPrior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we may do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders, a limited-time offer, or other product introduction or promotion. These offerings may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. These offerings may also increase our product return rate. We may experience difficulty effectively managing growth associated with these offerings and may face increased risk of improper sales force activities and related government scrutiny.\nIn addition, the size and condensed schedule of these product offerings increase pressure on our supply chain and order processing systems. We have in the past, and may in the future, failed to appropriately scale our system capacity and operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products, which reduces our sales force\u2019s confidence in our business and could harm our reputation and profitability.\nAs our sales force increases its use of social platforms to interact with customers, our business results could be adversely affected if our implementation of new platforms and processes to support our sales force is delayed. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for testing and delivery of portions of these and other of our information system platforms. Unanticipated changes or system failures by third parties could harm our ability to meet the expectations of our sales force, thus resulting in harm to our revenue, reputation and sales force confidence in our systems.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market for product launches or ongoing product sales, obtain sufficient ingredients, components or packaging or produce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our sales force and consumers. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations for a product launch or ongoing product sales or if we change our planned launch strategies or initiatives, we could incur inventory write-downs. For example, in 2015 and 2014, we incurred inventory write-downs of $37.9 million and $50.0 million, respectively, which primarily resulted from reduced sales expectations for product launches primarily in our Greater China region. Any additional write-down of inventory in any of our markets would negatively impact our gross margins. If we fail to effectively forecast product demand in the product launch process or for ongoing product sales, our reputation and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nIf our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa or any future devices, including our innovative daily-use beauty device that we plan to launch in the second half of 2020, are determined to be medical devices in a particular geographic market or if our sales force uses these products for medical purposes or makes improper medical claims, our ability to continue to market and distribute such devices could be harmed, and we could face legal or regulatory actions.\nOne of our strategies is to market unique and innovative products that allow our sales force to distinguish our products, including our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and our innovative daily-use beauty device that we plan to launch in the second half of 2020. Any determination by regulatory authorities in our markets that these products or any future devices must receive clearance or be registered as medical devices could restrict our ability to import or sell the product in such market until registration is obtained. While we have not been required to register our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner or ageLOC LumiSpa as medical devices in most of our markets, we have registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand and Colombia. In addition, we have received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use. There have been legislative proposals in the Philippines relating to the regulation of medical devices that could affect the way we market our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner and ageLOC LumiSpa in this market. In addition, if our sales force attempts to import or export products from one market to another in violation of our policy or is making medical claims regarding our products or using our products to perform medical diagnoses or other activities limited to licensed professionals or approved medical devices (in markets where the product is not approved), it could negatively impact our ability to market or sell these products and subject us to legal or regulatory actions.\nWhere necessary, obtaining medical device registrations and clearances could require us to provide documentation concerning product manufacturing and clinical utility, to make design, specification and manufacturing process modifications to meet standards imposed on medical device companies, and to modify our marketing claims regarding the registered product. While we successfully obtained clearance to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use in the United States, and registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand and Colombia, because medical device regulations vary widely from market to market, there can be no assurance we will not face challenges or delays in obtaining clearance in other markets, or that we will be able to make any required modifications or provide documentation necessary to obtain clearance. If we obtain such medical device clearance in order to sell a product in one market, such clearance may be used as precedent for requiring similar approval for the product in another market, or for similar products in the same market. These additional requirements could increase the cost associated with manufacturing and selling these products as non-medical devices in such markets.\nLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\nVarious government agencies throughout the world regulate direct sales practices. Laws and regulations in Japan, South Korea and Mainland China are particularly stringent and subject to broad discretion in enforcement by regulators. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d that compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets often:\n\u25cf impose requirements related to sign-up, order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\u25cf require us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\u25cf impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\u25cf impose reporting requirements; and\n\u25cf require that our sales force is compensated primarily for selling products and not for recruiting others.\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and may require significant resources. The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and like other direct selling companies, we are subject from time to time to government inquiries and investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our sales compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and investigations. In addition, markets where we currently do business could change their laws or regulations to prohibit direct selling. If we are unable to obtain necessary licenses and certifications within required deadlines or continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline. For example, we are currently in the process of renewing our license in Vietnam. Any delay could negatively impact our revenue.\nLimits on the amount of sales compensation we pay could inhibit our ability to attract and retain our sales force, negatively impact our revenue and cause regulatory risks.\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total value of goods or services supplied in South Korea. These regulations may limit the incentive for people to join our sales force and may reduce our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in attracting and retaining our sales force.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Because sales compensation, as a percentage of revenue, can fluctuate as sales force productivity fluctuates, we may be required to make further changes to stay within applicable sales compensation limits or may be at risk of exceeding them. In addition, which revenues and expenses are within the scope of these regulations is not always clear, and interpretation and enforcement of these laws are subject to change, which could require us to make further changes or result in non-compliance with these regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam or any other market that imposes a sales compensation limit could result in fines or other sanctions, including suspensions.\nGovernment regulations and private party actions relating to the marketing and advertising of our products and services may restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to sell our products and harm our business.\nGovernment authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts that we undertake to support our claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If we are unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for our product claims, or our marketing materials or the marketing materials of our sales force make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, cosmetics or devices that we offer, the United States Food and Drug Administration ( the \u201cFDA\u201d) or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, which could harm our business.\nFor example, in recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and our research and development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nIn the United States, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (\u201cGuides\u201d) require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing, and they generally do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our sales force has historically used testimonials and \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos to market and sell some of our popular products such as our ageLOC Spa systems and ageLOC Transformation anti-aging skin care system. We intend to continue to use testimonials for our popular products, including weight management products and other personal care products. In highly regulated and scrutinized product categories such as weight management, if we or our sales force fails to comply with the Guides or makes improper product claims, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our marketing materials.\nRegulations governing the registration or pre-approval of our products could harm our business.\nOur products are subject to numerous domestic and foreign government agencies\u2019 and authorities\u2019 laws and extensive regulations governing the ingredients and products that may be marketed without pre-market approval and/or registration. Many of these laws and regulations involve a high level of subjectivity, are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation, and vary significantly from market to market. These laws and regulations can also limit the claims we can make regarding our products and often restrict our ability to introduce products or ingredients into one or more markets.\nAt times these laws and regulations may delay or prevent us altogether from launching a product in a market, require us to reformulate a product or limit or amend the claims made regarding a product. If these laws and regulations further restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to introduce or market our products or limit the claims we are able to make regarding our products, our business may be harmed.\nFor example, in the United States, some legislators and industry critics have pushed for years to increase regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. In 2011, the FDA proposed draft guidance to clarify the FDA\u2019s interpretation of the dietary ingredient notification requirements, and in August 2016, the FDA issued a revised draft guidance that superseded the 2011 version. This draft guidance is not yet final but appears to indicate that the FDA is expanding its definition of what is considered a \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d in the United States. The industry has worked with the FDA for several years, providing comments to the FDA to modify this guidance. While still in flux, if enacted in final form as proposed, this guidance could impose new and significant regulatory barriers for our nutritional supplement products or unique ingredients, which could delay or inhibit our ability to formulate, introduce and sell nutritional supplements as we have in the past.\nWe face similar pressures in our other markets, which continue to set restrictions on ingredients and their acceptable maximum levels, as well as on ingredient characterization, quality and levels. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that were not marketed in Europe prior to May 1997 (\u201cnovel foods\u201d) without going through an extensive registration and pre-market approval process.\nSuch regulations in any given market can also limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action, and we could be fined or forced to alter or stop selling our products.\nThe FDA does not have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics. However, cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nNew regulations governing the formulation, introduction, marketing and sale of our products to consumers could harm our business.\nOur operations could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our products or impose additional burdens or requirements on us in order to continue selling our products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our products, resulting in significant loss of net sales.\nWe have observed a general increase in regulatory activity and activism in the United States and across many markets globally where we operate, and the regulatory landscape is becoming more complex with increasingly strict requirements. In particular, the requirements are impacting the ingredients we can include in our products, the accepted quantities of those ingredients and the quality and characterization of the ingredients. Global regulators have in recent years become overall more restrictive on the accepted levels of active ingredients that we can use in our product, in some cases banning them outright. They have also become more restrictive on permitted contaminant levels in ingredients and, in many cases, have forced complete removal of such contaminants. In certain cases, such as regarding some pesticides which are virtually ubiquitous in nature, it has proven difficult to comply with the requirements. Further, many of the restrictions regarding ingredient quality are not directly applicable to our products, leaving the possibility that our interpretation of compliance may not match that of the enforcing authorities. Often there is a lack of an equivalent active ingredient present in the marketplace. In other cases, the removal or reduction of a technical ingredient, such as various types of parabens, leads to a significant change to the character of the product that may make it no longer desirable or safe to the consumer. If this trend in new regulations continues, we may find it necessary to alter some of the ways we have traditionally marketed our products in order to stay in compliance with a changing regulatory landscape and this could add to the costs of our operations and/or have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur operations could be harmed if we fail to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices.\nAcross our markets, there are regulations on a diverse range of Good Manufacturing Practices that apply to us and to our vendors covering product categories such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, foods, over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. The Good Manufacturing Practices impose stringent requirements on a variety of topics, including vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. Ingredient identification requirements, which often require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us because our products contain many different ingredients. Additionally, certain Good Manufacturing Practices obligate us to track and periodically report adverse events to government agencies. Compliance with these increasing regulations may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance. In addition, our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities determine that we or our vendors are not in compliance with these regulations or if public reporting of adverse events harms our reputation for quality and safety. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products, including public withdrawals, seizures and recalls. For example, in prior years, we have had product recalls in the United States based on labeling issues. Problems associated with product recalls could be exacerbated due to the global nature of our business because a recall in one jurisdiction could lead to recalls in other jurisdictions. In addition, these risks associated with noncompliance could increase as we acquire businesses, including the businesses in our Rhyz strategic investment arm and any businesses we may acquire in the future.\nThe loss of suppliers or shortages in ingredients could harm our business.\nWe and our supply chain acquire ingredients, components, products and packaging from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. A loss of any of these suppliers and any difficulties in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers could harm our business. In addition, we obtain some of our products and ingredients from sole suppliers that own or control the product formulations, ingredients or other intellectual property rights associated with such products. We also license the right to distribute some of our products from third parties. In the event we are unable to renew these contracts, we may need to discontinue some products or develop substitute products, which could harm our revenue. In addition, if we experience supply shortages or regulatory impediments with respect to the raw materials, ingredients, components or packaging we use for our products, we may need to seek alternative supplies or suppliers and may experience difficulties in finding replacements that are comparable in quality and price. For example, some of our nutritional products, including g3 juice and ageLOC Youth (Youthspan or Y-Span in some markets), incorporate unique natural ingredients that are only harvested once per year and/or may have limited global supplies. If demand exceeds forecasts, we may have difficulties in obtaining additional supplies to meet the excess demand until the next growing season. If we are unable to successfully respond to such issues, our business could be harmed.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and reliance on third-party suppliers could harm our business.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and our reliance on third party suppliers to manufacture and deliver products that meet our specifications in a timely manner could harm our business. Occasionally, we have experienced production difficulties with respect to our products, including the availability of raw materials, components, packaging and products that do not meet our specifications and quality control standards. These production difficulties and quality problems have in the past, and could in the future, result in stock outages or shortages in our markets with respect to such products, harm our sales, or create inventory write-downs for unusable products.\nProduct diversion may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe see our products being sold through online marketplace sites and other distribution channels in certain markets. Although we continually take steps to control product diversion, including products sold in Mainland China, this activity continues to be a challenge, and we believe that changes to our global sales compensation plan or increased use of online channels for conducting sales transactions have and may continue to lead to increased product diversion. Product diversion causes confusion regarding our distribution channels and negatively impacts the ability of our sales force to sell our products. It also creates a negative impression regarding the viability of the business opportunity for our sales force, which can harm our ability to recruit new people to join our sales force. Product diversion schemes may also involve illegal importation, investment or other activities and harm our brand if gray market or counterfeit goods are passed off as our own. If we are unable to effectively address this issue or if diversion increases, our business could be harmed.\nChanges to our sales compensation plans could be viewed negatively by some of our sales force, could fail to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative impact on revenue.\nOur sales compensation includes some components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our sales compensation from time to time to keep our sales compensation plans and business models competitive and attractive to our existing sales force and people interested in joining our sales force, to address changing market dynamics, to provide incentives to our sales force that we believe will help grow our business, to conform to local regulations and to address other business needs. Because of the size of our sales force and the complexity of our sales compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how such changes will be viewed by our sales force and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. Certain changes we have made to our global sales compensation plan in the past, which were successful in several markets, did not achieve anticipated results in certain other markets and negatively impacted our business. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to implement significant changes to our global sales compensation plan, which we have now rolled out across all of our markets with the exception of Mainland China which operates under a different business model. Although we believe these changes have yielded some positive results in many of our markets to date, they have not been viewed positively by some segments of our sales force, and it is difficult to predict the long-term impacts of these changes.\nAmong the recent changes to our global sales compensation program is a change in the way that Sales Leaders who have developed larger sales organizations qualify for advancement in the plan. While we anticipate that these changes will result in Sales Leaders developing more sustainable and progressing sales teams over time, we have seen a corresponding reduction in directly developed Sales Leaders for this group of Sales Leaders with larger sales organizations during the transition. We also have introduced a new bonus program for our sales force, funded in part by slightly increased prices for some of our products. These price increases could decrease consumer demand, causing the bonus program to result in higher selling expenses without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Changes to reduce sales compensation have had a negative impact on the sales force in the past and could in the future.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been, and may again become in the future, party to litigation, investigations, audits or other legal matters. For example, in 2014, we were named as a defendant in a purported class action complaint relating to negative media and regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China and as a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative suit relating to the same issues. Also, beginning in 2014, we were in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which discussions were focused on a charitable donation we made in Mainland China in 2013 and issues related thereto. In April 2015, the SEC informed us that it was initiating a non-public, formal investigation into these issues. We also have been involved in two separate disputes with customs authorities in Japan with respect to customs assessments on several of our products. Although we settled the purported class action, shareholder derivative action and SEC investigation during 2016 and the Japan courts reached final decisions on the customs disputes in 2013 and 2018, these matters were, and any future matters that we may become involved in may be, expensive and time consuming. In general, litigation claims or other legal matters could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect financial results. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of any litigation to which we may become party, and the impact of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nOur international operations are subject to various anti-corruption laws, including principally the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions where we operate generally prohibit companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and they require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal accounting controls. We dedicate time and resources to internal investigations of any allegation that we are not or may not be in compliance with anti-corruption laws. Additionally, such allegations, even if untrue, may result in a government investigation, particularly given the trend in recent years of increased anti-corruption law enforcement activity and regulatory investigative actions by regulators in numerous jurisdictions, including the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the SEC. Our corporate policies require all employees to comply with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA\u2019s books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls requirements. Any regulatory determination, however, that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines and other penalties from U.S. or other regulatory entities.\nWe have in the past been found to have violated various aspects of the FCPA, and we may face similar fines or sanctions in the future. For example, in 2016, we reached a resolution with the SEC, in which the SEC found that our books and records and internal controls related to a charitable contribution in Mainland China in 2013 were insufficient, and we agreed to pay $765,688 to the SEC. In agreeing to this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings. Although we have implemented additional anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to prevent similar situations from arising in the future, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective or prevent future fines or penalties under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. Our competitors operating in China have also faced similar allegations from U.S. regulators and been fined accordingly in some circumstances. For example, in 2014, one of our competitors entered into a large settlement with U.S. regulators related to allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in Mainland China and other markets.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or new laws might be administered or interpreted. Alleged or actual violations of any such existing or future laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others) may result in criminal or civil sanctions or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations, including:\n\u25cf the possibility that a government might ban or severely restrict our sales compensation and business models;\n\u25cf the possibility that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in one or more markets-for example, the ongoing social incidents in Hong Kong, which began in 2019, have negatively affected our business in that market;\n\u25cf the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u25cf the presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax, customs, or other financial burdens on us or our sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and\n\u25cf the possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash.\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior and regional management, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our senior and regional management employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. In addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth in our markets. If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nGovernment authorities may question our tax or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business globally, we are subject to applicable tax and customs laws, including those relating to intercompany pricing regulations and transactions between our corporate entities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Periodically, we are audited by tax and customs authorities around the world. If authorities challenge our tax or customs positions, including those regarding transfer pricing and customs valuation and classification, we may be subject to penalties, interest and payment of back taxes or customs duties. The tax and customs laws in each jurisdiction change from time to time and are further subject to interpretation by the local government agencies. We have experienced increased efforts by customs authorities in some markets to reclassify our products or otherwise increase the level of duties we pay on our products. Despite our best efforts to be aware of and comply with tax and customs laws, including changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a potential risk that the local authorities may argue that we are out of compliance. Such situations may require that we defend our positions and/or adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes. Any or all of these potential risks may increase our effective tax rate, increase our overall tax or customs expense or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our sales force, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security, withholding or other taxes with respect to payments to our sales force. In addition, authorities in some jurisdictions have challenged the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of distributors of some multi-level marketing companies, and they may continue to do so. In the event that local laws and regulations, or the interpretation of local laws and regulations, change to require us to treat members of our sales force as employees rather than independent contractors, or that our independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including social security, withholding and related taxes, minimum wage laws, and any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. This risk increases as our sales force increases its use of social sharing, as several jurisdictions\u2019 regulations protect in-person or in-home sales demonstrations from creating an employment relationship but are less protective of online demonstrations. If our independent distributors were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors, we would also face the risk of increased liability for their actions.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where our subsidiaries are organized. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to change, with or without notice, due to economic, political and other conditions. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, changes in our business operations, acquisitions and dispositions, entry into new markets, the amount of our foreign earnings and where earned, losses incurred in jurisdictions, the inability to realize tax benefits, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, uncertain tax positions, allocation and apportionment of state taxes, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In addition, a number of countries are pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, as the U.S. did with its tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d). Foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the Tax Reform Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and may materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Tax Reform Act made significant changes to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Tax Reform Act changes are complex and subject to additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. As future guidance related to the Tax Reform Act is issued, adjustments to previously recorded amounts may be necessary, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. In addition, the individual states\u2019 reactions to the federal tax changes are evolving. As a result, the overall impact of the Tax Reform Act is uncertain. It is possible that the application of any new rules may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the outcome of audits, investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions.\nThe loss of or a disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal properties consisted of our corporate headquarters and other office locations, distribution centers and warehouses, research and development centers, and manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we also use third party manufacturers to manufacture many of our key products. As a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, import and export restrictions or delays, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. These risks may be heightened if we consolidate certain of our manufacturing, distribution or supply facilities or if we are unable to successfully enhance our disaster recovery planning. The loss of, or damage to, any of our facilities or centers, or that of our third-party manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets.\nWe may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability.\nOur markets are intensely competitive and market conditions and the strengths of competitors may harm our business.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. Our results of operations may be harmed by market conditions and competition in the future. Many competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we have, which may give them a competitive advantage. For example, our Nu Skin products compete directly with branded, premium retail products and with the products of other direct selling companies. Because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of personal care products and dietary supplements, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 products, and competing products entering the personal care and nutritional market could harm our revenue. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately adapt to trends in consumer behavior and technologies.\nWe also compete with other direct selling companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors have also adopted and could continue to adopt some of our successful business strategies, including our global sales compensation plan. Consequently, to successfully compete in this industry, and attract and retain our sales force and consumers, we must ensure that our business opportunities and sales compensation plans are financially rewarding. Although we believe we have significant competitive advantages, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete in this industry.\nWe may incur product liability claims that could harm our business.\nWe sell a variety of different products for human consumption and use, including cosmetics, dietary supplements, conventional foods, OTC drugs and devices. Our cosmetics, dietary supplements and conventional foods are not generally subject to pre-market approval or registration processes so we cannot rely upon a government safety panel to qualify or approve our products for use, and some ingredients may not have long histories of human consumption or use. We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products and conduct our own clinical and safety studies on some key ingredients and products, but not all products. A product may be safe for the general population when consumed or used as directed but could cause an adverse reaction for some individuals, such as a person who has a health condition or allergies or who is taking a prescription medication. While we include what we believe are adequate instructions and warnings and we have historically had low numbers of reported reactions, previously unknown adverse reactions could occur. If we discover that our products are causing adverse reactions, or if we determine that any of our employees have not properly handled reports of adverse reactions, we could suffer further adverse publicity or government sanctions.\nAs a result of the type of products that we sell, we may be subject to various product liability claims, including that the products fail to meet quality or manufacturing specifications, contain contaminants, include inadequate instructions as to their proper use, include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances or for persons with health conditions or allergies, or cause adverse reactions or side effects. Consumer protection laws and regulations governing our business continue to expand, and in some states such as California, class-action lawsuits based on increasingly novel theories of liability are expanding. Product liability claims could increase our costs, and adversely affect our business and financial results. As we continue to offer an increasing number of new products through larger scale, limited-time offers our product liability risk may increase.\nIf our sales force or employees provide improper or inappropriate advice regarding our products, their use or safety, we may be subject to additional product liability.\nWe have generally elected to self-insure our product liability risks. We continue to periodically evaluate whether we can and should obtain product liability insurance. Based upon our current approach to product liability risk management, if any of our products are found to cause any injury or damage or we become subject to product liability claims, we will be subject to the full amount of liability associated with any injuries or damages. This liability could be substantial and may exceed our existing reserves and harm our business.\nOur intellectual property may infringe on the rights of others, resulting in costly litigation.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, there has been an increase in the filing of suits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, which pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements quickly to dispose of such suits, regardless of their merit. Other companies or individuals may allege that we, or our sales force, consumers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, defending such intellectual property litigation can be costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Any of these results may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other markets, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, sales force, consumers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. In addition, the laws of certain foreign markets where we have significant business, including markets such as Mainland China, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our patents and trademarks may be substantial or even not practical. We have filed patent and trademark applications to protect our intellectual property rights in our new technologies, however, there can be no assurance that our patent and trademark applications will be approved and issue, that any patents and trademarks issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents and trademarks will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, many of our products rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as patent and trademark infringement suits or interference proceedings and seek indemnification by contract or otherwise. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and we may ultimately fail to prevail or recover on any indemnification claim. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our financial condition or diminish our investments in this area.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. Our employees may leave to work for competitors. Our distributors or Sales Leaders may seek other opportunities. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our current or former employees, distributors, Sales Leaders, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims that we, or our employees, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other personal care product or nutritional supplement companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent that our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those in which they were involved with their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\nAny acquired companies or future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.\nWe have acquired certain businesses, and we may continue to do so in the future as we encounter acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. The financing for any of these acquisitions could dilute the interests of our stockholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Our past acquisitions have, and future acquisitions could, entailed numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf increased fixed costs;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with our suppliers, sales force or consumers; and\n\u25cf risks associated with entering markets or industries in which we have limited or no prior experience, including limited expertise in running the business, developing the technology, and selling and servicing the products.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, or a failure to adjust our fixed costs quickly enough or sufficiently to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.\nA failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our regulatory compliance efforts could harm our stock price and our financial and operating results or could result in fines or penalties.\nWe have implemented internal controls to help ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting, including to detect and prevent fraudulent actions within our financial and accounting processes, and we have implemented compliance policies and programs to help ensure that our employees and sales force comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal audit team regularly audits our internal controls and various aspects of our business and compliance program, and we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. There can be no assurance, however, that our internal or external assessments and audits will identify all fraud, misstatements in our financial reporting, and significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. Material weaknesses have in the past, and may in the future, resulted in a material misstatement of our financial results, requiring us to restate our financial statements, as occurred in 2014, when our management concluded that we did not maintain effective controls over the presentation and disclosure of hyper-inflationary accounting for our Venezuela subsidiary.\nFrom time to time, we initiate further investigations into our business operations to further bolster our regulatory compliance efforts or based on the results of our internal and external audits or on complaints, questions or allegations made by employees or other parties regarding our business practices and operations. In addition, our business and operations may be investigated by applicable government authorities. In the event any of these investigations identify material violations of applicable laws by our employees, sales force or affiliates, we could be subject to adverse publicity, fines, penalties or loss of licenses or permits.\nSystem failures, capacity constraints and other information technology difficulties could harm our business.\nWith global operations and a complex sales compensation plan, our business is highly dependent on efficiently functioning information technology systems, including websites, mobile applications, data centers, databases, networks and other systems. We rely on these systems for accepting and processing sales orders, operating our sales force and customer support operations, tracking and compensating our sales force, conducting our corporate and regional operations, and other aspects of our business. Accordingly, the performance, reliability and availability of our systems are critical to our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain our sales force and customers.\nOur systems may be damaged or disrupted by fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, human error, telecommunications failures, power loss, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, cyber attacks, changes in our information technology systems or organization, and other events. We have, and may in the future, experienced system failures and outages. We cannot guarantee that the preventive measures we take, including redundancies, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent or remedy system failure or interruption, data loss, security breaches or other data security incidents. Furthermore, any mitigation process could take several days or more, thus resulting in a loss of revenue, loss of confidence of our sales force and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, we make significant expenditures on our information technology infrastructure and other technology initiatives, and these items could become obsolete or impaired, which has and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenses to address. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we engaged a chief transformation officer, who was charged with reviewing and evaluating our information technology infrastructure and organization and our social sharing and digital initiatives. Following this review, we determined to alter our strategic direction with respect to some of our systems and tools, resulting in impairment charges of approximately $49 million. We also incurred approximately $22 million in severance payments and other expenses related to the reorganization of our Information Technology Department and other corporate and regional offices. In addition to these charges, additional cash outlay and new personnel were necessary for execution of new plans and strategy.\nOur systems could also be strained by growth in our business. Although we work to expand and enhance our ecommerce features, network infrastructure and other technologies to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic to our ecommerce channels, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Our failure, or our suppliers\u2019 failure, to achieve or maintain system capacity could significantly reduce our ability to fulfill orders and could harm our business, reputation, revenue and financial condition.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of company, employee, sales force or guest data could expose us to data loss, litigation, liability and harm to our reputation.\nWe collect, store and transmit large volumes of company, employee, sales force and guest data, including payment card information, personally identifiable information and other personal information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business.\nWe are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the payment card industry. For example, during 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in the European Union, imposing increased data protection regulations, the violation of which could result in fines of up to 4% of our annual revenue. Many other jurisdictions have similarly enacted security and privacy regulations, including California and Mainland China, and we believe this trend will continue. In the United States, congressional committees have held preliminary hearings about the advisability of a federal data privacy law, but it is uncertain whether the federal government will adopt such a law and whether it would preempt state data privacy laws. The prospect of new data privacy laws and ambiguity regarding the interpretation of existing laws has resulted in significant uncertainty and compliance costs. In addition to laws specifically governing privacy and data security, in some cases, federal and state regulators and state attorneys general and administrative agencies have interpreted more general consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Although we monitor regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant penalties, lawsuits and negative publicity and require changes to our business practices. In particular, maintaining compliance with these and other evolving regulations and requirements around the world often requires changes to our information system architecture and data storage processes. Making these changes is, and will likely continue to be, difficult and expensive. Investigations by the regulators of data security laws could also result in the payment of fines and harm our reputation. Private actions by affected individuals could also result in significant monetary or reputational damage.\nSimilarly, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could cause us to incur penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, litigation and adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release, misuse or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, sales force or guest data. Although we take measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of our data systems, we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees and types on a regular basis. Our infrastructure may be vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases it could take time to discover them. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of sensitive information and lead to significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory inquiries or investigations, loss of confidence by our sales force and customers, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, and costs associated with remediating the incident. These risks are heightened as we work with third-party partners, including providers of mobile and cloud technologies, and as our sales force uses social media, as the partners and social media platforms could be vulnerable to the same types of breaches. Acquisition activity, which we have engaged in and which we may continue to engage in, may also heighten these risks, as the systems of the companies we acquire are not under our control prior to the acquisitions and it may take time to evaluate these systems and implement appropriate modifications to them.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control.\nOur Class A common stock closed at $71.84 per share on January 31, 2018 and closed at $32.59 per share on January 31, 2020. During this two-year period, our Class A common stock traded as low as $32.52 per share and as high as $88.68 per share. Many factors, including some we may be unable to control, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall. Some of these factors include:\n\u25cf fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf government investigations of our business;\n\u25cf trends or adverse publicity related to our business, products, industry or competitors;\n\u25cf the sale of shares of Class A common stock by significant stockholders;\n\u25cf demand, and general trends in the market, for our products;\n\u25cf acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf economic or currency exchange issues in markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf speculative trading, including short selling and options trading; and\n\u25cf general economic, business, regulatory and political conditions.\nBroad market fluctuations could also lower the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have currency controls in place, which change from time to time and may restrict our repatriation of cash.\nIf foreign governments restrict transfers of cash out of their country and control exchange rates, we may be limited as to the timing and amount of cash we can repatriate and may not be able to repatriate cash at beneficial exchange rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the United States through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of intangible property, and corporate services. However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends. For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the form of dividends until we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period. As of December 31, 2019, we had $76.6 million in cash denominated in Chinese RMB. Currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela also impeded our Venezuela subsidiary\u2019s ability to obtain U.S. dollars to pay for imported products or to repatriate dividends to the United States. We ceased business operations in Venezuela in 2016.", "PERMNO": 84172, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "NUS"}
