Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nIf one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which have been volatile at times, may adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms.\nOur future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 91% of our Proved Reserves were natural gas and approximately 89% of our production was natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that affect the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas include:\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of domestic production;\n\u2022\nthe availability of imported oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nfederal regulations generally prohibiting the export of U.S. crude oil;\n\u2022\nfederal regulations applicable to the export of, and construction of export facilities for natural gas and NGLs.\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations, including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of other competitive fuels;\n\u2022\nfluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;\n\u2022\nconcerns about global warming or other conservation initiatives and the extent of governmental price controls and regulation of production;\n\u2022\nregional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nforeign and domestic government relations; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions.\nIn the past, prices of oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. During 2014, the NYMEX price for natural gas fluctuated from a high of $6.15 per Mmbtu to a low of $2.89 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $53.27 per Bbl. For the five years ended December 31, 2014, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $6.15 per Mmbtu to a\nlow of $1.91 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price ranged from a high of $113.93 per Bbl to a low of $53.27 per Bbl. On December 31, 2014, the spot market price for natural gas at Henry Hub was $2.89 per Mmbtu, a 32% decrease from December 31, 2013. On December 31, 2014, the spot market price for crude oil at Cushing was $53.27 per Bbl, a 46% decrease from December 31, 2013. For 2014, our average realized prices (before the impact of derivative financial instruments) for oil and natural gas were $87.80 per Bbl and $3.79 per Mcf, respectively, compared with 2013 average realized prices of $93.80 per Bbl and $3.35 per Mcf, respectively.\nOur revenues, cash flow and profitability and our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices.\nChanges in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reference or regional index prices that we use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have recently experienced significant volatility in our price differentials including crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale and natural gas production from certain areas in Appalachia. Our crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale is currently sold at a price based on the Phillips 66 West Texas Intermediate index plus or minus the differential to the Argus Louisiana Light Sweet index. During 2014, this differential ranged from a high of $7.93 per barrel to a low of $2.21 per barrel. Our natural gas production from the Marcellus shale in Northeast Pennsylvania is sold at a price based on a Platts index that represents value into the Transco Leidy Pipeline. Due to the increased production in this region without an offsetting increase in pipeline capacity or infrastructure to the Northeast United States markets, this differential in 2014 ranged from a low of NYMEX less $1.32 per Mmbtu to a high of NYMEX less $2.94 per Mmbtu. These differentials vary depending on factors such as supply, demand, pipeline capacity, infrastructure, and weather.\nWe may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues.\nOur ability to market our oil and natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. We are primarily dependent upon third parties to transport our production. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We have experienced production curtailments in our producing regions resulting from capacity restraints, offsetting fracturing stimulation operations and short term shutdowns of certain pipelines for maintenance purposes. As we have increased our knowledge of our shale properties, we have begun to shut in production on adjacent wells when conducting completion operations. Due to the high production capabilities of these wells, these volumes can be significant. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. If market factors dramatically change, the impact on our revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas and the value of our common shares.\nWe have entered into marketing agreements with third-parties to sell a significant percentage of our anticipated oil and natural gas production in the East Texas/North Louisiana and South Texas regions. If these third-parties are unable or otherwise fail to market the oil and natural gas we produce, we would be required to find alternate means to market our production, which could increase our costs, reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our oil and natural gas production or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas.\nOur ability to collect payments from the sale of oil and natural gas to our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. In addition, in recent years, it has become more difficult to maintain and grow a customer base of creditworthy customers because a number of energy marketing and trading companies have discontinued their marketing and trading operations, which has significantly reduced the number of potential purchasers for our oil and natural gas production. As a result, we may experience a material loss as a result of the failure of our customers to pay us for prior purchases of our oil or natural gas. In addition, the loss of any significant customer may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments, such as lack of available transportation or infrastructure, may hinder our production or adversely impact our ability to receive market prices for our production or to achieve expected drilling results.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements or infrastructure may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and oil and condensate trucking operations owned and operated by third-parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines, gathering systems or trucking capacity. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, excessive pressures, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or other disruptions of service. Curtailments and disruptions may last from a few days to several months, and we have no control over when or if third-party facilities are restored.\nIn the past we have experienced production curtailments due to infrastructure and market constraints in the Eagle Ford shale formation, which has caused natural gas production to either be shut in or flared. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transportation would interfere with our ability to market our oil and natural gas production, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation and marketing agreements primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers or marketers regardless of quantities actually shipped or marketed. If we are unable to deliver the necessary quantities of natural gas, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into significant natural gas firm transportation contracts primarily in East Texas and North Louisiana that require us to pay fixed amounts of money to the shippers regardless of quantities actually shipped. The use of firm transportation agreements allows us priority space in a shippers\u2019 pipeline.\nWe have entered into an agreement to deliver an aggregate minimum volume commitment of natural gas production from the Holly and Shelby fields to certain gathering systems over a five year period. If there is a shortfall to the minimum volume commitment in any year, then we are severally responsible with a joint venture partner to pay fixed amounts of money to the gatherer regardless of quantities actually produced in to the systems.\nIn addition, we have also entered into a marketing agreement with respect to our Haynesville production whereby we are required to deliver a minimum amount of natural gas from the Haynesville shale. We will be required to make material expenditures for these agreements if we fail to deliver the required quantities of natural gas in the future.\nWe anticipate the deliveries of natural gas in future periods will not meet the minimum quantities set forth in certain of these agreements and will require us to make payments for the shortfall below the minimum quantities. In the event the quantities delivered under these arrangements are significantly below the minimum volumes within the agreements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to develop properties in new or emerging formations may be subject to more uncertainties than drilling in areas that are more developed or have a longer history of established production.\nOur drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs, obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials, which result in increased costs to drill wells. Also, we may experience issues with the availability of water and sand used in our drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, including our properties in shale formations, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are developed, have established production or where we have a longer history of operation. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict future drilling results. Our experience with horizontal drilling in these areas to date, as well as the industry\u2019s drilling and production history, while growing, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. We plan to implement several initiatives to manage our base production and minimize the decline from our shale properties. If these initiatives are not successful and we are required to incur significant expenditures to manage our base production, this could negatively impact our production and cash flows from operations.\nIf our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material impairments of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures, and our failure to continue such joint ventures or resolve any material disagreements with our partners could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Furthermore, the actions taken by other working interest owners could prevent or alter our development plans.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint ventures with third parties, principally BG Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (\"KKR\"), and as a result, the continuation of such joint ventures is vital to our continued success. We may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. In many instances we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as agreed payments of substantial development costs pertaining to the joint venture and their share of other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our joint venture partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations, these joint ventures and/or our ability to enter into future joint ventures.\nSuch joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our joint venture partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partners;\n\u2022\njoint venture partners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;\n\u2022\ndisputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business;\n\u2022\nthat under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture, and an impasse could be reached which might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture; and\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may decide to terminate their relationship with us in any joint venture company or sell their interest in any of these companies and we may be unable to replace such joint venture partner or raise the necessary financing to purchase such joint venture partner\u2019s interest.\nThe failure to continue some of our joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with our joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe owners of working interests may not consent to the development of certain properties that we operate which may require us to assume their share of the working interest during the development and a period after the well is on production. This may require us to expend additional capital not already anticipated as part of our development plans and assume additional risks associated with the development and future performance of the properties. The owners of working interests in certain properties that we operate may also hold rights within the respective operating agreements that could prevent us from performing additional development activities on the properties such as recompletions and other workovers without their consent.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to implement our growth strategy.\nThe growth of our business will require substantial capital on a continuing basis. Due to the amount of debt we have incurred, it may be difficult for us in the foreseeable future to obtain additional debt financing or to obtain additional secured financing other than purchase money indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms and conditions or at all, we may lose opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and businesses and, therefore, be unable to implement our growth strategy.\nWe may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital.\nOur success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. In addition, if our reserves and production decline, then the amount we are able to borrow under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement will also decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves.\nAcquisitions, development drilling and exploratory drilling are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploratory drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected. The planned reduction in our development program in 2015 compared to prior years could negatively impact our ability to replace our reserves in the future.\nWe may not identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, and any indemnification we receive from sellers may be insufficient to protect us from such risks, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to us.\nGenerally, it is not feasible for us to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. Our business strategy focuses on acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas properties. Any future acquisitions will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards and liabilities, potential tax and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 liabilities, other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher-valued properties. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well that we acquire. Potential problems, such as deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions that may require significant remedial expenditures, are not necessarily observable even when we inspect a well. Any unidentified problems from acquisitions could result in material liabilities and costs that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to identify problems with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnify us against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnification, the indemnification may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnification.\nIf we are unable to complete the joint development of our assets in the Eagle Ford shale formation with KKR, we may need to find alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOn July 31, 2013, we closed the acquisition of certain producing and non-producing oil, natural gas and mineral leases and wells in the Eagle Ford shale located in Zavala, Dimmit and Frio counties in South Texas. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets, we sold an undivided 50% interest in the undeveloped acreage to affiliates of KKR for approximately $130.9 million. With respect to each well drilled, we will assign half of our undivided 50% interest in such well to KKR such that KKR will fund and own 75% of each well drilled and we will fund and own 25% of each well drilled. There can be no assurance that KKR will elect to proceed with subsequent phases of the development of our Eagle Ford assets. If we cannot identify an alternative joint venture partner or partners for our Eagle Ford assets, sell assets at acceptable valuations or are unable to complete the joint development of our Eagle Ford assets, we will need to utilize cash flow from other operations or will need to find alternative sources of capital to finance the development of the Eagle Ford assets, which may slow the development of these assets and have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.\nWhile we are required to make offers to purchase KKR\u2019s interest in certain wells, we may not have sufficient funds or borrowing capacity under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to complete the acquisitions pursuant to the KKR Participation Agreement. In the event we fail to purchase a group of wells that KKR is obligated to sell, there are remedies available to KKR which allow KKR to reject future EXCO offers, terminate the KKR Participation Agreement, or pursue other legal remedies. This could require us to seek alternative financing to make offers to preserve KKR\u2019s obligation to sell to us, or negatively impact our ability to increase our Eagle Ford assets through acquisitions of KKR\u2019s producing properties.\nWe may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. These decisions could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of acquisitions with our operations and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.\nIntegration of our acquisitions with our business and operations has been a complex, time consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully assimilate our past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u2022\nthe risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe loss of significant key employees from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nOur estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves, our financial condition and the value of our common shares.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our Proved Reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure of our Proved Reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue and such estimates prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially.\nOur actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, decisions and assumptions made by engineers and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may negatively affect the value of our common shares.\nWe may have impairments of our asset values, which could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, and at the end of each quarterly and annual period when we are required to test the carrying value of our assets using full cost accounting rules, we may be required to record an impairment to the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the past experienced, and may experience in the future, ceiling test impairments with respect to our oil and natural gas properties.\nOur evaluation of impairment is based upon estimates of Proved Reserves. The value of our Proved Reserves may be lowered in future periods as a result of a decline in prices of oil and natural gas, a downward revision of our oil and natural gas reserves or other factors. As a result, our evaluation of impairment for future periods is subject to uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because several of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot accurately predict or control\nthe amount of ceiling test impairments in future periods. Future ceiling test impairments could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not recognize any impairments to our proved oil and natural gas properties. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized impairments of $108.5 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, to our proved oil and natural gas properties. We may have additional impairments of our oil and natural gas properties in future periods if the cost of our unamortized proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the limitation under the full cost method of accounting. As a result of recent decline in oil and natural gas prices, we expect to recognize additional impairments to our oil and natural gas properties in 2015 if prices do not increase.\nWe also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting units exceeds the estimated fair value of those reporting units, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. As a result of our testing of goodwill for impairment, we did not record an impairment charge for the periods ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and blowouts;\n\u2022\npipe failures;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination).\nWe have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling, production and midstream operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigation;\n\u2022\npenalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u2022\nattorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nAs is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.\nOur operations are conducted primarily in Texas, North Louisiana and Appalachia. The weather in these areas can be extreme and can cause interruption in our exploration and production operations. Severe weather can result in damage to our facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment.\nLikewise, our operations are subject to disruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, winter storms and severe cold, which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to our facilities. Additionally, many municipalities in Appalachia impose weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to our jobsites due to the conditions caused by spring thaws.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain\nnumerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s budget proposals for fiscal year 2016 contain numerous proposed tax changes, and from time to time, legislation has been introduced that would enact many of these proposed changes. The proposed budget and legislation would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and natural gas companies and impose new fees. Among others, the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas properties; repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. The passage of legislation containing some or all of these provisions or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe EPA\u2019s implementation of climate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our oil and natural gas production.\nAlthough federal legislation regarding the control of emissions of GHGs for the present appears unlikely, the EPA has been implementing regulations under existing CAA authority, some of which may affect our operations. GHGs are certain gases, including carbon dioxide, a product of the combustion of natural gas, and methane, a primary component of natural gas, that may be contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, resulting in climatic changes. These GHG regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our oil and natural gas production.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA established GHG reporting requirements for sources in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. Although this rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it requires us to incur costs to monitor, record and report GHG emissions associated with our operations. The EPA recently announced its intention to take measures to require or encourage reductions in methane emissions, including from oil and natural gas operations. The measures include the development of NSPS regulations in 2016 for reducing methane from new and modified oil and natural gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. In addition, some states have considered, and notably California has adopted, a state specific GHG regulatory program that may limit GHG emissions or may require costs in association with the control of GHG emissions.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. Most hydraulic fracturing (other than hydraulic fracturing using diesel) is exempted from regulation under the SDWA. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal SDWA to remove the exemption from regulation and permitting that is applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Sponsors of bills previously introduced before the Senate and House of Representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. Many states have adopted or are considering legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing, including the disclosure of chemicals used in the process. Such bills or similar legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance. At the state and local levels, some jurisdictions have adopted, and others are considering adopting, requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, as well as bans on hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent state or local legal\nrestrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we have properties, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program (\"UIC\"). Further, in March 2010, the EPA announced that it would conduct a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. Interim results of the study were expected in 2012; although final results are not yet available. The agency also announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for 2014 through 2016 would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector. This study and enforcement initiative could result in additional regulatory scrutiny that could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Consequently, these studies and initiatives could spur further legislative or regulatory action regarding hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations.\nIn addition, the EPA has issued guidance under the SDWA providing direction on how it will address the use of diesel in hydraulic fracturing activities and how its UIC will be applied to such hydraulic fracturing activities. Moreover, the EPA has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed draft rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and the EPA has announced an initiative under the Toxic Substances Control Act to develop regulations governing the disclosure and evaluation of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. If hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operations restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce.\nOur business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures.\nOur operations are subject to numerous complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Laws, rules and regulations protecting the environment have changed frequently and the changes often include increasingly stringent requirements. We could incur material costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions (including injunctive relief) and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own activities, but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by us that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent, for example, the regulation of GHG emissions under the federal CAA, or state or regional regulatory programs. Regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA, or various states in the United States in areas in which we conduct business, for example, could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Moreover, the EPA has shown a general increased scrutiny on the oil and gas industry through its GHG, CAA and SDWA regulations.\nThe EPA has adopted rules subjecting oil and natural gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (\"NSPS\"), and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, (\"NESHAPS\"), programs under the CAA, and imposing new and amended requirements under both programs. Among other things, the rule amends standards applicable to natural gas processing plants and expands the NSPS to include all oil and natural gas operations, imposing requirements on those operations. The rule also imposes NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These standards include the reduced emission completion techniques. Additionally, the EPA recently announced its intention to take measures to require or encourage reductions in methane emissions, including from oil and natural gas operations. The measures include the development of NSPS regulations in 2016 for reducing methane from new and modified oil and natural gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. The NESHAPS also includes maximum achievable control technology standards for certain glycol dehydrators and storage vessels, and revises applicability provisions, alternative test protocols and the availability of the startup, shutdown and maintenance exemption. The implementation of these new requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and we may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have greater financial and technical resources and a larger headcount than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant expense/cost increases. We may experience difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how such shortages and price increases will affect our development and exploitation program. Competition has also been strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in petroleum engineering, geoscience, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land professions. In addition, competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. We are often outbid by competitors in our attempts to acquire properties or companies. All of these challenges could make it more difficult to execute our growth strategy.\nWe are currently involved in a search for a new chief executive officer and if this search is further delayed or if we were to lose the services of other key personnel, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe have been engaged in a search for a new chief executive officer since November 2013. To the extent there is a further delay in choosing a new chief executive officer, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, our future success depends in part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. Our senior management team is critical to our management and they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments is subject to risks that our counterparties may default on their contractual obligations to us and may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in us making cash payments.\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of oil and natural gas, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, derivative financial instrument arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Our derivative financial instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment. The change in the fair market value of these instruments is reported as a non-cash item in our consolidated statements of operations each quarter, which typically results in significant variability in our net income. Derivative financial instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following:\n\u2022\nmarket prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments;\n\u2022\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative financial instrument agreement and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative financial instrument contract may default on its contractual obligations to us.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments could have the effect of reducing our revenues and the value of our securities. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we paid cash settlements on our derivative financial instrument contracts totaling $19.0 million and during the year ended December 31, 2013, we received cash receipts of $42.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, a $1.00 increase in the average commodity price per Mcfe would have resulted in an increase in cash settlement payments (or a decrease in settlements received) of approximately $94.1 million. As of December 31, 2014, our oil and natural gas derivative financial instrument contracts were in the net asset position of $98.5 million. The ultimate settlement amount of these unrealized derivative financial instrument contracts is dependent on future commodity prices. We may incur significant realized and unrealized losses in the future from our use of derivative financial instruments to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nOur net operating loss and other tax attribute carryovers (\"NOLs\") may be limited if we undergo an ownership change. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points looking back over a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs to reduce income taxes is limited to an annual amount, or the Section 382 limitation, equal to the fair market value of our common shares immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax-exempt interest rate, which is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). In the event of an ownership change, NOLs can be used to offset taxable income for years within a carryforward period subject to the Section 382 limitation. Any excess NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year will continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the carryforward period. Whether or not an ownership change occurs, the carryforward period for NOLs is 20 years from the year in which the losses giving rise to the NOLs were incurred. If the carryforward period for any NOL were to expire before that NOL had been fully utilized, the unused portion of that NOL would be lost. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected by the Section 382 limitation (unless there is another ownership change after the new NOLs arise).\nWe exist in a litigious environment.\nAny constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. In addition, we are defendants in numerous cases involving claims by landowners for surface or subsurface damages arising from our operations and for claims by unleased mineral owners and royalty owners for unpaid or underpaid revenues customary in our business. We incur costs in defending these claims and from time to time must pay damages or other amounts due. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas production company, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal control over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of our company or\nincreased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had approximately $1.5 billion of indebtedness, including $202.5 million of indebtedness subject to variable interest rates and $750.0 million and $500.0 million of indebtedness under the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectfully. Our total interest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs, on an annual basis based on currently available interest rates would be approximately $102.6 million and would change by approximately $2.0 million for every 1% change in interest rates.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes (\"Indenture\"), and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty borrowing money in the future for acquisitions (including obligations to acquire interests in wells pursuant to the Participation Agreement with KKR), capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nwhen oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult and our borrowing base is subject to reductions, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required but unable to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all and may be required to surrender assets pursuant to the security provisions of the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantially more debt, which may intensify the risks described above, including our ability to service our indebtedness.\nTogether with our subsidiaries, we may incur substantially more debt in the future in connection with our exploration, exploitation, development, acquisitions of undeveloped acreage and producing properties. The restrictions in our debt agreements on our incurrence of additional indebtedness are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness, the risks described above could substantially increase. Significant additions of undeveloped acreage financed with debt may result in increased indebtedness without any corresponding increase in borrowing base, which could curtail drilling and development of this acreage or could cause us to not comply with our debt covenants.\nTo service our indebtedness, fund our planned capital expenditure programs and fund acquisitions under the KKR Participation Agreement, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and other resources in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our 2018 Notes, 2022 Notes and the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, to fund planned capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and capital expenditure programs, we may be forced to sell assets, issue additional equity or debt securities or restructure our debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nOur borrowing base under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is subject to semi-annual redeterminations. The borrowing base redetermination process considers assumptions related to future commodity prices; therefore, our borrowing capacity could be negatively impacted by further declines in oil and natural gas prices. This was evidenced by our recent borrowing base redetermination in February 2015 which reduced the borrowing base to $725.0 million primarily as a result of the recent declines in commodity prices as compared to commodity prices at the time of the prior borrowing base redetermination. If our borrowing base were to be reduced to a level which was less than the current borrowings, we would be required to reduce our borrowings to a level sufficient to cure any deficiency. We may be required to sell assets or seek alternative debt or equity which may not be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIn addition, we conduct certain of our operations through our joint ventures and subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our joint ventures and subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes or our other indebtedness, our joint ventures and subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our joint ventures and subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each joint venture and subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our joint ventures and subsidiaries. While the Indenture and the agreements governing certain of our other existing indebtedness limit the ability of certain of our joint ventures and subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our joint ventures and subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the 2018 Notes and 2022 Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nThe EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale or leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into specified investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or\n\u2022\npursue other corporate activities.\nAlso, the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these financial covenants. These financial covenants could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and the Indenture. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. When oil and/or natural gas prices decline for an extended period of time, our ability to comply with these covenants becomes more difficult. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and could result in acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. An event of default under the Indenture would permit the lenders under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing during general economic, business or industry downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with our hedges and insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under the credit agreement.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\nOur common share price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common shares trade on the NYSE but an active trading market for our common shares may not be sustained. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nconditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nthe success of our operating strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe operating and share price performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common shares. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations.\nOur articles of incorporation permit us to issue preferred shares that may restrict a takeover attempt that you may favor.\nOur articles of incorporation permit our board to issue up to 10,000,000 preferred shares and to establish by resolution one or more series of preferred shares and the powers, designations, preferences and participating, optional or other special rights of each series of preferred shares. The preferred shares may be issued on terms that are unfavorable to the holders of our common shares, including the grant of superior voting rights, the grant of preferences in favor of preferred shareholders in the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation and the designation of conversion rights that entitle holders of our preferred shares to convert their shares into common shares on terms that are dilutive to holders of our common shares. The issuance of preferred shares in future offerings may make a takeover or change in control of us more difficult.\nOaktree Capital Management, WL Ross & Co. LLC and/or their respective affiliates have significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval because of their ownership of our common shares.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d), and WL Ross & Co. LLC (\u201cWL Ross\u201d), directly or through certain affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 16.6% and 18.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common shares. The beneficial ownership of Oaktree and WL Ross and/or their affiliates provides them with significant influence regarding matters submitted for shareholder approval, including proposals regarding:\n\u2022\nany merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe election of members of our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nany amendment to our articles of incorporation.\nThe current or increased ownership position of Oaktree, WL Ross and/or their respective affiliates could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares. The interests of Oaktree, WL Ross, and/or their respective affiliates may significantly differ from the interests of our other shareholders and they may vote the common shares they beneficially own in ways with which our other shareholders disagree.", "PERMNO": 91109, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EXCE"}
