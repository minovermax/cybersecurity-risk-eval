{"cik": "798081", "company": "LAKELAND INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks before investing in our common stock. These are not the only risks that we may face. If any of the events referred to below actually occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information in this Form 10-K and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nWhile as a smaller reporting company disclosure of risk factors is not required, the Company is voluntarily including such disclosures.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry and Other Matters\nCovenants in our credit facilities may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs a result of the refinancing on June 28, 2013 and as amended on March 31, 2015 and June 3, 2015, we currently have a $15 million revolving credit facility, expiring June 2017. Our new credit facility requires, and any future credit facilities may also require, among others that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage, minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and maximum capital expenditures. Our ability to satisfy these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the requirements of these covenants. These restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business, including a limitation on annual investments and advances we can make to foreign subsidiaries. Default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. Our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our current credit facilities, and it is likely that our future lenders will have security interests in our assets. If our lenders declare amounts outstanding under any credit facility to be due, the lenders could proceed against our assets. Any event of default, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be exposed to continuing and other liabilities arising from our discontinued Brazilian operations.\nOn July 31, 2015, we completed the sale of our Brazilian subsidiary (\u201cLakeland Brazil\u201d) to a current officer of that company pursuant to the Shares Transfer Agreement. As part of the sale, in order to enable Lakeland Brazil to have sufficient funds to continue to operate for a period of at least two years following the closing date, we paid an aggregate of US $717,000, in cash, to Lakeland Brazil in the form of a capital raise, and agreed to fund an additional R$1,574,000(approximated $508,000), in cash, in form of a capital raise, all of which has been paid.\nIn addition, we may continue to be exposed to certain liabilities arising in connection with the prior operations of Lakeland Brazil, including, without limitation, from lawsuits pending in the labor courts in Brazil in which plaintiffs were seeking, as at July 31, 2015, a total of nearly US $8,000,000 in damages from our then Brazilian subsidiary. We believe many of these labor court claims are without merit and the amount of damages being sought is significantly higher than any damages which may have been incurred. Pursuant to the shares purchase agreement, we are required to fully fund amounts owed by Lakeland Brazil in connection with the then existing labor claims by Lana dos Santos and to pay amounts potentially owed for future labor claims up to an aggregate amount of $375,000 plus 60% of the excess of such amount until the earlier of (i) the date all labor claims against Lakeland Brazil deriving from events prior to the sale are settled, (ii) by our mutual agreement with Lakeland Brazil or (iii) on the two (2) year anniversary of closing of the sale. As of January 31, 2016, the Lana dos Santos claim was settled for $272,000 and $79,000 was paid in respect of other labor claims. With respect to continuing claims, $278,000 is being sought, of which management estimates the aggregate liability will be less than that amount.\nWe may also be exposed to VAT tax liabilities. On December 11, 2015, we entered into a Loan Agreement for VAT Payment with Lakeland Brazil pursuant to which we agree to provide Lakeland Brazil an amount of up to R$ 8,584,012 (approximately US $2.29 million) to settle Lakeland Brazil\u2019s two largest outstanding VAT claims with the State of Bahia. The State of Bahia declared an amnesty beginning November 1, 2015 and expiring December 18, 2015 and we believe that settlement of the VAT claims under amnesty would benefit us in that it would eliminate these large VAT claims, which could render the continued viability of Lakeland Brazil immaterial to us. Such settlement may also eliminate the possibility of our sale of Lakeland Brazil being found fraudulent on the basis of evading VAT claims as well as eliminate the possibility of future encumbrance of our real estate by the State of Bahia subsequent to VAT claims. Lakeland Brazil completed the amnesty agreement with the State of Bahia on December 18, 2015.\nWe claimed a worthless stock deduction in connection with our exit from Brazil which has generated a tax benefit of approximately US $9.5 million. While along with our tax advisors we believe that this deduction is valid, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge it and, if challenged, there is no assurance that the Company will prevail.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls or are unable to remediate a material weakness in our internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis involves substantial effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have documented and tested our internal controls and procedures for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO). Based upon an evaluation performed, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2016 based on the remediation of the material weakness discussed in Item 9AControls and Procedures.\nSince the Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company, an attestation report of management\u2019s assessment of internal control by our independent auditors is not required.\nWe may need additional funds, and if we are unable to obtain these funds, we may not be able to expand or operate our business as planned.\nOur operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to seek additional capital, whether from sales of equity or by borrowing money, to fund acquisitions for the future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn.\nA number of factors could affect our ability to access future debt or equity financing, including:\n\u00b7 Our financial condition, strength and credit rating;\n\u00b7 The financial markets\u2019 confidence in our management team and financial reporting;\n\u00b7 General economic conditions and the conditions in the homeland security sector; and\n\u00b7 Capital markets conditions.\nEven if available, additional financing may be more costly than our current facility and may have adverse consequences. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. Although management believes it currently has sufficient capital following our equity financing in October 2014, if we do need additional capital in the future and are unsuccessful, it could reduce our net sales and materially adversely impact our earning capability and financial position.\nBecause we have incurred losses for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 and 2014 and for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2016, there can be no assurance we will not incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in prior years, including net losses of $26.3 million for FY13 and $0.1 million for FY14. Such losses in FY13 and FY14 resulted mainly from losses sustained by us in Brazil, including for FY13 (a) the write-down in Brazil of goodwill and other intangibles, (b) a $7.9 million charge from our arbitration settlement in Brazil, and (c) the termination of our supply agreement with DuPont de Nemours. As a result of the losses we suffered from our Brazilian operations, in July 2015, we transferred all of our ownership of those operations to an officer of that company. Although we were profitable in FY15 and the first three quarters of FY16, we suffered a loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of FY16 due to soft sales demand in the Energy sector, strengthening of the USD globally and overall slow economic conditions. As a result there can be no assurances that profitability will continue in the future.\nWe are subject to risk as a result of our international manufacturing operations.\nBecause most of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in China and Mexico, our operations are subject to risk inherent in doing business internationally. Such risks include the adverse effects on operations from corruption, war, international terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, governmental activities, deprivation of contract and property rights and currency valuation changes.\nSince 1978, the Chinese government has been reforming its economic and political systems, and we expect this to continue. Although we believe that these reforms have had a positive effect on the economic development of China and have improved our ability to successfully operate our facilities in China, we cannot assure you that these reforms will continue or that the Chinese government will not take actions that impair our operations or assets in China. In addition, periods of international unrest may impede our ability to manufacture goods in other countries, such as Mexico presently, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our assembly arrangements with our foreign-based subsidiaries or third-party suppliers require payment to be made in US dollars or Euros. Any decrease in the value of the US dollar or the Euro in relation to foreign currencies could increase the cost of the services provided to us upon contract expirations or supply renegotiations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase product prices to offset any such cost increases, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks as a result of our sales to customers in foreign countries in the amount of $43.1 million in FY16. Our sales in these countries are usually denominated in the local currency. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to these local currencies, and we are unable to raise our prices proportionally, then our profit margins could decrease because of the exchange rate change.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries. To manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates, we seek to limit, to the extent possible, our non-US dollar denominated purchases and sales.\nIn connection with our operations in China, we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the United States. However, our purchases in China are primarily made in the Chinese RenminBi. (\u201cRMB\u201d), the value of which had been largely pegged to the US dollar for the last decade. However, the Chinese RMB has been decoupled from the US dollar and allowed to float by the Chinese government and, therefore, we have been exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our Chinese raw material and component purchases.\nOur primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non-US dollar denominated sales in Canada and Europe and, to a smaller extent, in other South American countries. Our sales to customers in Canada are denominated in Canadian dollars, in Europe in Euros and British pounds and in China in RMB. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to the Canadian dollar, the Pound or the Euro, then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange. Our sales from China are denominated in the Chinese RMB, US dollar and Euros. We manage the foreign currency risk through the use of rolling 90-day forward contracts against the Canadian dollar and Euros and through longer term cash flow hedges in China against the Euro. We do not hedge other currencies at this time. In the event that non-US dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur results of operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results of operations have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future. These fluctuations may be caused by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 Currency volatility;\n\u00b7 Global crisis, such as the Ebola outbreak or oil spills;\n\u00b7 Our expansion of international operations;\n\u00b7 Competitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 Seasonal buying patterns resulting from the cyclical nature of the business of some of our customers;\n\u00b7 Changes in the mix of products and services sold;\n\u00b7 The timing of introductions and enhancements of products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 Market acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7 Technological changes in fabrics or production equipment used to make our products;\n\u00b7 Changes in the mix of domestic and international sales;\n\u00b7 Personnel changes; and\n\u00b7 General industry and economic conditions.\nThese variations could negatively impact our stock price.\nRapid technological change could negatively affect sales of our products and our performance.\nThe rapid development of fabric technology continually affects our apparel applications and may directly impact the performance of our products. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain or improve the effectiveness of our existing products, nor can we assure you that we will successfully identify new opportunities or continue to have the needed financial resources to develop new fabric or apparel manufacturing techniques in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, products manufactured by others may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. If any of these events occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause we do not have long-term commitments from many of our customers, we must estimate customer demand, and errors in our estimates could negatively impact our inventory levels and net sales.\nOur sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, which may later be modified or canceled by the customer, rather than on long-term commitments. We have historically been required to place firm orders for fabrics and components with our suppliers prior to receiving an order for our products, based on our forecasts of customer demands. Our sales process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates, causing excess inventory to accrue or a lack of manufacturing capacity when needed. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to or not at all. As a result, we would have excess inventory, which would negatively impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would lose sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to delivery dates required by our customers because of the lead time needed for us to obtain required materials or to send fabrics to our assembly facilities in China and Mexico. We must recruit and retain skilled employees, including our senior management, to succeed in our business.\nOur operations are substantially dependent upon key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel, including Christopher J. Ryan, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, Teri Hunt, our Chief Financial Officer, and Stephen Bachelder, our Chief Operating Officer. The loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any future expansion of our business will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, marketing, customer service and manufacturing personnel, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for specific fabrics, and we may not be able to obtain substitute suppliers and manufacturers on terms that are as favorable, or at all, if our supplies are interrupted.\nOur business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with vendors and our ability to purchase raw materials at competitive prices. The loss of key vendor support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not have multiyear supply contracts with any of our finished goods or fabric suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire raw materials and components at competitive prices or on competitive terms in the future.\nOther than our purchases of Kevlar\u00ae and Nomex\u00ae fabrics, both of which we bought either directly and indirectly from DuPont since 1986, we generally use standard fabrics and components in our products. We rely on nonaffiliated suppliers and manufacturers for the supply of these fabrics and components that are incorporated in our products. If such suppliers or manufacturers experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity or quality assurance difficulties, or if there is a disruption in our relationships, we will be required to locate alternative sources of supply. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate such alternative sources. In addition, we do not have any long-term contracts with any of our suppliers for any of these components. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components, if and as required in the future, may result in:\n\u00b7 Interruptions and delays in manufacturing and resulting cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u00b7 Increases in fabrics or component prices that we may not be able to pass on to our customers; and\n\u00b7 Our holding more inventory than normal because we cannot finish assembling our products until we have all of the components.\nWe deal in countries where corruption is an obstacle.\nWe must comply with American laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Sarbanes-Oxley and also with recently passed anticorruption legislation in the U.K. Some of our competitors and customers in foreign jurisdictions may not adhere to such legislation. As a result, we believe that we lose sales orders due to our strict adherence to such regulations.\nWe face competition from other companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources than we do.\nThree of our competitors, DuPont, Honeywell and Kimberly Clark, have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do. In addition, we believe that the barriers to entry in the disposable and reusable garments and gloves markets are relatively low. We cannot assure you that our present competitors or competitors that choose to enter the marketplace in the future will not exert significant competitive pressures. Such competition could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.\nSome of our sales are to foreign buyers, which exposes us to additional risks.\nWe derived approximately 43.3% of our net sales from customers located in foreign countries in FY16. We intend to seek to increase the amount of foreign sales we make in the future. The additional risks of foreign sales include:\n\u00b7 Potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 Higher credit risks;\n\u00b7 Restrictive trade policies of foreign governments;\n\u00b7 Currency hyperinflation and weak banking institutions;\n\u00b7 Changing economic conditions in local markets;\n\u00b7 Political and economic instability in foreign markets; and\n\u00b7 Changes in leadership of foreign governments.\nSome or all of these risks may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant reduction in government funding for preparations for terrorist incidents could adversely affect our net sales.\nAs a general matter, a significant portion of our sales growth to our distributors is dependent upon resale by those distributors to customers that are funded in large part by federal, state and local government funding. Specifically, depending on the year, approximately 20% of our high-end chemical suit sales are dependent on government funding. Congress passed the 2001 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Both of these Acts provide for funding to fire and police departments and medical and emergency personnel to respond to terrorist incidents. Appropriations for these Acts by the federal government could be reduced or eliminated altogether. Any such reduction or elimination of federal funding, or any reductions in state or local funding, could cause sales of our products purchased by fire and police departments and medical and emergency personnel to decline.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these claims.\nWe manufacture products used for protection from hazardous or potentially lethal substances, such as chemical and biological toxins, fire, viruses and bacteria. The products that we manufacture are typically used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury. Failure to use our products for their intended purposes, failure to use our products properly or the malfunction of our products could result in serious bodily injury to or death of the user. In such cases, we may be subject to product liability claims arising from the design, manufacture or sale of our products. If these claims are decided against us, and we are found to be liable, we may be required to pay substantial damages, and our insurance costs may increase significantly as a result. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim. In addition, we cannot assure you that this or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, that we will be able to obtain it at a reasonable cost. Any material uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur US operations, including our manufacturing facilities, are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. Any violation of any of those laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial liability to the Environmental Protection Agency, the state environmental agencies in any affected state or to any individuals affected by any such violation. Any such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur directors and executive officers have the ability to exert significant influence on our Company and on matters subject to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned or could vote approximately 8.06% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of their ownership of common stock and their positions in our Company, our directors and executive officers are able to exert significant influence on our Company and on matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. In particular, as of January 31, 2016, Christopher J. Ryan, our chief executive officer, president and secretary and a director, beneficially owned or votes approximately 5.9% of our common stock. The ownership interests of our directors and executive officers, including Mr. Ryan, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company that may be favored by our stockholders generally.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation contains classified board provisions, authorized preferred stock that could be utilized to implement various \u201cpoison pill\u201d defenses and a stockholder authorized, but as yet unused, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d), all of which may have the effect of discouraging a takeover of Lakeland, which is not approved by our board of directors. Further, we are subject to the antitakeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner.\nAcquisitions could be unsuccessful.\nIn the future, subject to capital constraints, we may seek to acquire selected safety products lines or safety-related businesses which will complement our existing products. Our ability to acquire these businesses is dependent upon many factors, including our management\u2019s relationship with the owners of these businesses, many of which are small and closely held by individual stockholders. In addition, we will be competing for acquisition and expansion opportunities with other companies, many of which have greater name recognition, marketing support and financial resources than us, which may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, as well as higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, pursue or acquire any targeted business and, if acquired, there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired business into our Company without substantial costs, delays and other operational or financial problems.\nIf we proceed with additional acquisitions for cash, we may use a substantial portion of our available line of credit (if available) in order to consummate any such acquisition. We may also seek to finance any such acquisition through debt or equity financings, and there can be no assurance that such financings will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If consideration for an acquisition consists of equity securities, our stockholders could be diluted. If we borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, such indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business as we currently intend because of restrictions placed on us under the terms of the indebtedness and because we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on the debt instead of to our operations, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks in addition to those mentioned above, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, potential exposure to unknown liabilities, adverse effects on our reported operating results and the amortization or write-down of acquired intangible assets. We cannot assure you that any acquisition by us will or will not occur, that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business. To the extent that we are unable to manage growth efficiently and effectively or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results, announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and other events or factors. For example, a shortfall in net sales or net income, or an increase in losses, from levels expected by securities analysts or investors, could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nOur common stock is an equity interest and therefore subordinated to our indebtedness.\nPayments of the principal and interest under the notes issued under the loan agreements entered into in connection with our senior financing are secured by liens on, and security interests in, substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 present and after-acquired assets. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock would rank below all debt and creditor claims against us. As a result, holders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up until after all of our obligations to our debt holders and creditors have been satisfied.\nWe are precluded from paying and do not anticipate paying any dividends to our common stockholders in the near future.\nWe are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends to our common stockholders without the prior consent of our senior and junior lenders. Further, we have not paid dividends on our common stock since August 2006 and we do not anticipate, if permitted, paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations.", "PERMNO": 10645, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "LAKE"}
