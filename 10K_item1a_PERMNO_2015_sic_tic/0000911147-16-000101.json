{"cik": "911147", "company": "CENTURY CASINOS INC /CO/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur short and long-term success is subject to many factors beyond our control. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this report, actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nWe face significant competition, and if we are not able to compete successfully, our results of operations will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other casinos in jurisdictions in which we operate and from destination venues. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players\u2019 clubs and other marketing efforts. For example, for our casino in Edmonton, Canada we emphasize the casino\u2019s showroom, heated parking, players\u2019 club program, and superior service. These marketing efforts may not be successful, which could hurt our competitive position.\nThe markets in which we operate are generally not destination resort areas and rely on a local customer base as well as tourists during peak seasons. The number of casinos in our markets may exceed demand, which could make it difficult for us to sustain profitability. New or expanded operations by other entities in any of the markets in which we operate will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. We are particularly vulnerable to competition in Colorado and Poland. Currently, Internet gaming is not allowed in the jurisdictions in which we operate; however, Internet gaming or other gaming opportunities that become available in our markets could attract players that might otherwise have visited our casinos. Capital expenditures, such as room refurbishments, amenity upgrades and new gaming equipment may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our properties. If we are not successful in making these improvements, our facilities may be less attractive to our visitors than those of our competitors, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, which involve considerable expense and could harm our business.\nAs owners and operators of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local, and international provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. Various regulatory authorities may, for any reason set forth in applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. In Canada, our licenses must be renewed every five years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018 for our casinos in both Edmonton and Calgary. At Century Downs and in Colorado, our licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2016 for Century Downs and 2017 for our casinos in Central City and Cripple Creek. In Poland, our licenses must be renewed every six years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2016 for both the Lim Center casino in Warsaw and the Katowice casino. We may not be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities may also levy substantial fines against us or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could force us to terminate operations at an existing gaming facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, could result in us being fined or could prohibit us from successfully completing a project in which we invest. Closing facilities or an inability to expand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPotential changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nFrom time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or that may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of the gaming industry that results in increased competition and any restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to record an impairment of our assets. In particular, in Colorado, there have been repeated attempts to expand gambling beyond Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek to other towns, racetracks, bingo halls, and tribal gaming through legislation, ballot initiatives, and administrative action by state or local agencies and this is a continuing competitive threat to us. Periodic changes in the membership of the Colorado Gaming Commission and turnover in the office of the Governor of Colorado (who appoints both the members of the Gaming Commission and the executive director of the Department of Revenue, which oversees the Gaming Commission) also could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, in Alberta, Canada, a new government was elected in May 2015. A portion of the gross gaming revenue that CDR receives from HRA is subject to conditions in an agreement between the Albertan government and HRA that expires on March 31, 2016. While HRA, as representative of the horse racing industry, is working diligently to extend this agreement, there can be no assurance that such an extension will be adopted or that it will have terms and conditions that are as favorable to us as those in the current agreement. If the agreement between the Albertan government and HRA is not extended or is extended on terms that are less favorable to us, our results of operations at CDR may be adversely affected.\nWe face extensive taxation from gaming and regulatory authorities. Potential changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue to a jurisdiction through taxation and fees is one of the primary reasons jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, provincial, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. For instance, the Colorado constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds. The current gaming tax in Colorado established by the Colorado Gaming Commission is a graduated rate of 0.25% to 20% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds, where casinos pay a higher percentage as their adjusted gross proceeds increase. At our Edmonton and Calgary casinos, the AGLC retains 85% of slot machine net sales, of which the AGLC allocated 15% to licensed charities. For all table games in Alberta, Canada, excluding poker and craps, we are required to allocate 50% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC. For poker and craps in Alberta, Canada, we are required to allocate 25% of our net win to the charity. At CDR, the AGLC retains 33% of slot machine net sales, which are allocated to the Alberta Lottery Fund. During the first five years of CDR\u2019s operations, HRA retains 23.25% of slot machine net sales to fund animal welfare programs, purses, breed improvement programs, marketing, and administration and backstretch programs. After the first five years of operations at CDR, HRA will retain 26.25% of slot machine net sales. The Polish Minister of Finance assesses a gaming tax rate on gross gaming revenue of 50%. In addition, negative economic conditions could intensify the efforts of federal, state, provincial and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes or introduction of additional gaming opportunities.\nWe may be unable to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.\nOur operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos and most of our revenue is essentially cash-based. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development. While we have a significant amount of cash currently on hand, we may not be able to obtain funding when we need it on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our bank credit facility. In addition, the amount of capital that we are able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control, such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume. Funding may be impacted by the global economic, credit and stock market conditions. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, in a timely manner or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs and may be highly dilutive to our current stockholders. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to reduce, dispose of or eliminate certain operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur financing agreements in Canada and Poland impose restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility, and a default could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur various credit agreements require us to adhere to a number of significant financial covenants. These restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries in Canada and Poland to incur additional debt, obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. A breach of any covenant in any of our credit agreements would result in an event of default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. An event of default, if not waived or cured, could cause the lender to accelerate the repayment of all outstanding amounts due under the agreement, foreclose on the security granted under the agreement and enforce the Company\u2019s obligations under its guarantee. There can be no assurances that we or our subsidiaries would be able to obtain a waiver of an event of default or modification of a covenant if necessary, or otherwise obtain alternative sources of funding to repay the obligation if a default occurred. Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDifficulties in managing our worldwide operations may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn 2015, we derived our revenue principally from operations located on two continents and on cruise ships operating around the world. Our management is located in the United States and Europe. Our worldwide operations pose risks to our business, especially for a smaller company such as ours. Risks associated with international operations include:\n\u00b7\ndifferent time zones;\n\u00b7\nculture, management and language differences;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and policies that govern our foreign operations;\n\u00b7\npossible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in establishing staffing and managing non-United States operations;\n\u00b7\ndifferent labor regulations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7\neconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\nuncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.\nThese factors make it more challenging to manage and administer a globally-dispersed business and, as a result, we must devote greater resources to operating under several regulatory and legislative regimes (See \u201cGovernmental Regulation and Licensing\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d). This business model also increases our costs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe intend to develop and operate additional properties in the future and if our development efforts are not successful, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe regularly review opportunities to develop new properties. We may not be successful in obtaining the rights to develop such properties, and as a result, we may incur significant costs for which we will receive no return. Even if we are successful in obtaining the rights to develop new casino properties, commencing operations at new casino projects may require substantial development capital. Additional risks before commencing operations include the time and expense incurred and unforeseen difficulties in obtaining suitable sites, liquor licenses, building permits, materials, competent and able contractors, supplies, employees, gaming devices and related matters.\nWe may engage in construction projects as part of our development of additional properties in the future. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Most of these factors are beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects. This could materially adversely affect our plan of operations, financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nWe may pursue gaming opportunities that would require us to obtain a gaming license. While our management believes that we are licensable in any jurisdiction that allows gaming operations, each licensing process is unique and requires a significant amount of funds and management time. The licensing process in any particular jurisdiction can take significant time and expense through licensing fees, background investigation costs, fees of counsel and other associated preparation costs. Moreover, if we proceed with a licensing approval process with industry partners, such industry partners would be subject to regulatory review as well. We seek to find industry partners that are licensable, but cannot assure that such partners will, in fact, be licensable. Certain licenses include competitive situations where, even if we and our industry partners are licensable, other factors such as the economic impact of gaming, financial and operational capabilities of competitors must be analyzed by regulatory authorities. In addition, political factors may make the licensing process more difficult. If any of our gaming license applications are denied, we may have to write off costs related to our investment in such application processes, which could be significant. In addition, our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for any new location is critical to our success. One or more of these risks may result in any new gaming opportunity not being successful. If we are not able to successfully commence operations at these properties, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed by cyber security breaches, and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers', our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes, is a critical element of our operations. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws as well as the applicable laws in other countries in which we operate. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests.\nOur information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, or our employee or business information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or by actions or inactions by our employees. As a result, information of our customers, third party service providers or business partners or our business information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their or our consent. Non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in a loss of customers and subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. If a cyber security breach were to occur, it could have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be adversely affected by reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of consumer concerns over economic conditions, homeland security, terrorism and war.\nOur business may be adversely affected by international, national and local economic and political conditions. The volatile global economic environment has had and is continuing to have negative effects on our business because our business is largely impacted by discretionary consumer spending. Reductions in discretionary consumer spending or changes in consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, housing market instability, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and may adversely affect our revenue and operating cash flow. We are unable to predict the frequency, length or severity of economic circumstances.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including gaming, lodging and tourism. For example, our locations in Poland are in close proximity to Ukraine and Russia. While we have not experienced any material impact from the acts of hostility between the two countries, an increase in those hostilities could adversely affect our casinos in Poland. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts or war, or hostilities in countries throughout the world will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results.\nInclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business, which may hamper our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reductions in the number of customers who visit our properties because of severe weather conditions. If weather conditions limit access to our casino properties or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casinos at full capacity, our revenue will suffer, which will negatively impact our operating results. High winds, flooding, blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, such as those experienced in Colorado, Alberta and Poland from time to time, can limit access to our properties.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance, that insurance is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitations on the coverage period for business interruption. Due to these variables, we may not be able to fully insure such losses, or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from severe weather conditions. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage or self-insure. Among other factors, regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed by work stoppages and other labor issues.\nThere are 152 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland who belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at our casino properties in Poland could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our employees in the U.S. and Canada and in our Corporate and Other segment are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we have experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. If a union seeks to organize any of our employees, we could experience disruption in our business and incur significant costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. If a union were successful in organizing any of our employees, we could experience significant increases in our labor costs which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency controls in foreign countries could adversely affect our business.\nOur casinos in Canada and Poland represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty, respectively. Decreases in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar have decreased the operating profit from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars, which has adversely affected our consolidated results of operations, and such decreases may occur in the future. In addition, we may expand our operations into other countries and, accordingly, we could face similar exchange rate risk with respect to the costs of doing business in such countries as a result of any increases in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of such countries. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations of these foreign currencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge any future foreign currency exposure.\nWe have invested $1.0 million in capital in the MCE project located in Argentina. In addition, we have a Consulting Services Agreement with MCE in which CCE will receive a service fee consisting of of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE\u2019s EBITDA. Argentina has implemented currency controls within the country that could limit our ability to repatriate our initial capital, the consulting service fee, or other funds.\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger, our Co Chief Executive Officers, and other members of our senior management team. The employment agreements with Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger provide that, under some circumstances, the departure of one executive could allow the other to leave for cause. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.\nWe have $188 million of tangible and intangible assets, including $10 million of goodwill, $3 million in casino licenses, $2 million in trademarks and $132 million in property and equipment as of December 31, 2015. Accounting rules require that we make certain estimates and assumptions related to our determinations as to the future recoverability of these assets. If we were to determine that the values of these assets carried on our balance sheet are impaired due to adverse changes in our business or otherwise, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the value of these assets, which would adversely affect our results during the period in which we recorded the impairment charge.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe current U.S. administration has made public statements indicating that international tax reform is a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed a wide variety of potential changes. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the U.S. until those earnings are repatriated to the U.S., could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, the cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the U.S. could be affected. Due to our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn Poland, tax laws and other Polish laws and regulations change from time to time and often there is no reference to established regulations or cases. The current Polish laws and regulations also have ambiguities that lead to differences in interpretations between authorities and between authorities and companies. Taxes or other payments may frequently be inspected by Polish authorities that are authorized to impose significant fines, extra liabilities and interest for underpayments. As a result, the tax risk is higher in Poland than in countries with better-developed tax systems. For example, we have open tax audits currently in litigation with the Polish Internal Revenue Service (\u201cPolish IRS\u201d) (see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d). Polish tax payments may be inspected for up to five years. As a result, the amounts included in the financial statements for Polish taxes may change at a later date after the final amounts are determined, and other Polish laws and regulations may lead to additional liabilities.\nWe are dependent upon technology services and electrical power to operate our business, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. Without electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers, we may be unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Additionally, substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may decline significantly and unexpectedly.\nOur common stock trades in the U.S. on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which consists of relatively small issuers and a lack of significant trading volumes relative to other U.S. markets. These factors may result in volatility in the price of our common stock. For instance, the trading price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market in 2014 and 2015 varied from a high of $8.21 to a low of $4.71.\nCertain anti-takeover measures we have adopted may limit our ability to consummate transactions that some of our security holders might otherwise support.\nWe have a fair price business combination provision in our certificate of incorporation, which requires approval of certain business combinations and other transactions by holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions generally have the effect of requiring that any party seeking to acquire us negotiate with our board of directors in order to structure a business combination with us. This may have the effect of depressing the price of our common stock due to the possibility that certain transactions that our stockholders might favor could be precluded by these provisions.\nRegulation Risk Related to Stockholders\nStockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by U.S. gaming authorities.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. and Canada generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner's suitability, and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming regulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities, and the price we pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 79791, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CNTY"}
