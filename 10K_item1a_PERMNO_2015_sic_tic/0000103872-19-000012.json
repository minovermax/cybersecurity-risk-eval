{"cik": "103872", "company": "VOLT INFORMATION SCIENCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-01-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nWe maintain a risk management program which incorporates assessments by our officers, senior management and board of directors, as periodically updated. The following risks have been identified. You should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report. The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock. Other risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently do not recognize as material could also materially adversely affect our business and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.\nThe contingent staffing industry is very competitive with few significant barriers to entry\nThe markets for Volt\u2019s staffing services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of dollars in annual revenue. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. Some of our competitors are larger than us, have substantial marketing and financial resources and may be better positioned in certain markets than we are. These companies may be better able than we are to attract and retain qualified personnel, to offer more favorable pricing and terms, or otherwise attract and retain the business that we seek. Any inability to compete effectively could adversely affect our business and financial results. Clients may also take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party. In addition, some of our staffing services customers, generally larger companies, are mandated or otherwise motivated to utilize the services of small or minority-owned companies rather than large corporations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in our business segments.\nOur business is adversely affected by weak economic and other business conditions\nDuring periods of elevated unemployment levels, demand for contingent and permanent personnel decreases, which adversely impacts our staffing services. During slower economic activity, many companies tend to reduce their use of contingent workers and reduce their recruitment of new employees. Decreased demand and higher unemployment levels result in lower levels of pay rate increases and increased pressure on our markup of staffing service rates, direct margins and higher unemployment insurance costs.\nOur credit facility contains financial covenants that may limit our ability to take certain actions\nWe remain dependent upon our financing agreement which includes certain financial covenants. These covenants could constrain the execution of our business strategy and growth plans. Our ability to continue to meet these financial covenants is not assured. If we default under any of these requirements, our lenders could restrict our ability to access funds in our customer collections account, declare all outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due and payable, or significantly increase the cost of the facility. Under such circumstances, there could be no assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the indebtedness at favorable rates or at all. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. As of October 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nThe inability to renew our credit facility could negatively affect our operations and limit our liquidity\nWe rely on financing for future working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. The structure of our financing requires us to renew our arrangements periodically. There can be no assurance that refinancing will be available to us or that we will be able to negotiate replacement financing at reasonable costs or on reasonable terms. The volatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to our business in the future. Turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit may make it more difficult for us to meet our working capital requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to execute successfully on our business strategies or achieve the intended results\nOur business strategy focuses on growing revenues and driving growth in higher margin services. We have made targeted investments, adjusted our operating models and increased the resources necessary for driving sustainable growth within our targeted higher-margin service offerings. If we are unsuccessful in executing on our business strategies, we may not achieve either our stated goal of revenue growth or the intended productivity improvements, which could negatively impact profitability and liquidity and require us to alter our strategy.\nWe could incur liabilities or our reputation could be damaged from a cyber-attack or improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate, candidate or client data, including personal data.\nOur business involves the use, storage and transfer of certain information about our full-time and contingent employees, customers and other individuals. We rely upon multiple information technology systems and networks, some of which are web-based or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. This information contains sensitive or confidential employee and customer data, including personally identifiable information. The secure and consistent operation of these systems, networks and processes is critical to our business operations. Our systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, the target of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs, and other cyber-security incidents that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 sensitive and personal data. Successful cyber-attacks or other data breaches, as well as risks associated with compliance with applicable data privacy laws, could harm our reputation, divert management attention and resources, increase our operating expenses due to the employment of consultants and third party experts and the purchase of additional infrastructure, and/or subject us to legal liability, resulting in increased costs and loss of revenue.\nWhile we proactively safeguard our data and have enhanced security software and controls, it is possible that our security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party service providers follow may not prevent improper access to, or disclosure of, such information. Any such disclosure or security breach could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, social engineering, cyber-attacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach.\nAs cyber-attacks increase in frequency and sophistication, our cyber-security and business continuity plans may not be effective in anticipating, preventing and effectively responding to all potential cyber-risk exposures. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which are not uniform and may possibly conflict in jurisdictions and countries where we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nAdditionally, our employees and certain of our third-party service providers may have access or exposure to sensitive customer data and systems. The misuse or unauthorized disclosure of information could result in contractual and legal liability for us due to the actions or inactions of our employees or vendors.\nWe are subject to employment-related claims, commercial indemnification claims and other claims and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business\nOur staffing services business employs or engages individuals on a contingent basis and places them in a customer\u2019s workplace. Our ability to control the customer\u2019s workplace is limited, and we risk incurring liability to our employees for injury (which can result in increased workers\u2019 compensation costs) or other harm that they suffer in the scope of employment at the customer\u2019s workplace or while under the customer\u2019s control.\nAdditionally, we risk liability to our customers for the actions or inactions of our employees, including those individuals employed on a contingent basis that may cause harm to our customers or other employees. Such actions may be the result of errors and omissions in the application of laws, rules, policies and procedures, discrimination, retaliation, negligence or misconduct on the part of our employees, damage to customer facilities or property due to negligence, criminal activity and other similar claims. In some cases, we must indemnify our customers for certain acts of our employees, and certain customers have negotiated broad indemnification provisions. We may also incur fines, penalties and losses that are not covered by insurance or negative publicity with respect to these matters. There can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have in place will be effective or that we will not experience losses due to such risks. In addition, we may face claims related to violations of wage and hour regulations, Fair Credit Reporting Act violations, discrimination, harassment, negligence or misconduct by our employees, and claims relating to the misclassification of independent contractors, among other types of claims.\nCosts related to litigation, legal proceedings and investigations could adversely impact our financial condition\nWe may be involved in pending and threatened legal proceedings brought by third parties and investigations by government and regulatory agencies from time to time, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. It is uncertain at what point any such matters may materially affect us, and there can be no assurance that our financial resources or insurance policies are sufficient to cover the cost of any or all of such claims. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such matters would not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe loss of major customers could adversely impact our business\nWe experience revenue concentration with large customers within certain operating segments. Although we have no customer that represents over 10% of our consolidated revenue, there are customers that exceed 10% of revenues within both the International Staffing and North American MSP segments. The deterioration of the financial condition or significant change to the business or staffing model of these customers or multiple customers in a similar industry, or similar customers that are interdependent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any reductions, delays or cancellation of contracts with any of our key customers, or the loss of one or more key customers, could materially reduce our revenue and operating income. There can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to do business with us or that contracts with existing customers will continue at current or historical levels.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements in a timely fashion, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements. These circumstances could lead to a significant decrease in the trading price of our shares, or the delisting of our shares from the NYSE AMERICAN, which would harm our shareholders.\nNew or increased government regulation, employment costs or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially for our contingent staffing business\nCertain of our businesses are subject to licensing and regulation in some states and most foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these requirements, or that the cost of compliance will not become material. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we do or intend to do business may:\n\u2022\ncreate new or additional regulations that mandate additional requirements or prohibit or restrict the types of services that we currently provide;\n\u2022\nchange regulations in ways that cause short-term disruption or impose costs to comply;\n\u2022\nimpose new or additional employment costs that we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services;\n\u2022\nrequire us to obtain additional licenses; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes (especially payroll and other employment-related taxes) or enact new or different taxes payable by the providers or users of services such as those offered by us, thereby increasing our costs, some of which we may not be able to pass on to customers or that could cause customers to reduce their use of our services especially in our staffing services, which could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn some of our foreign markets, new and proposed regulatory activity may impose additional requirements and costs, which could have an adverse effect on our contingent staffing business.\nOur operational results could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and other global business risks\nOur global operations subject us to risks relating to our international business activities, including global economic conditions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and numerous legal and regulatory requirements placed upon the Company\u2019s international clients.\nVariation in the economic condition or unemployment levels in any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business may severely reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nOur business is exposed to fluctuation in exchange rates. Our operations outside the United States are reported in the applicable local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rates for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Exchange rates for currencies of these countries may fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar and these fluctuations may have an adverse or favorable effect on our operating results when translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\nIn addition, the Company faces risks in complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, including U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences, difficulty in staffing and managing international operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) referendum to exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The terms of Brexit and the resulting U.K./E.U. relationship are uncertain for companies doing business both in the U.K. and the overall global economy. The U.K. vote has impacted global markets, including various currencies, and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British Pound as compared to the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. The fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions. Volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact from Brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations the U.K. conducts.\nFluctuations in interest rates and turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations\nWhile we have access to global credit markets, credit markets may experience significant disruption or deterioration, which could make future financing difficult or more expensive to secure. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board, which recently increased rates and may continue to do so. Increases in interest rates would increase our borrowing costs over time and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf a financial institution that is party to our credit facility were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreement with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our contracts provide no minimum purchase requirements, are cancellable during the term, or both\nIn our staffing services business, most of our contracts, even those with multi-year terms, provide no assurance of any minimum amount of revenue, and under many of these contracts we still must compete for each individual placement or project. In addition, many of our contracts contain cancellation provisions under which the customer can cancel the contract at any time or on relatively short notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Therefore, these contracts do not provide the assurances that typical long-term contracts often provide and are inherently uncertain with respect to the amount of revenue and earnings we may recognize.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow may be negatively affected if we are not able to keep pace with rapid changes in technology\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. We must innovate and evolve our services and products to satisfy customer requirements, attract talent and remain competitive. There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to foresee changes needed to identify, develop and commercialize innovative and competitive services and products in a timely and cost-effective manner to achieve customer acceptance in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product and service introductions.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems which are vulnerable to damage and interruption\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and cloud services, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, manage a variety of business processes and activities, and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities, collection and retention of customer data, employee information and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. While we take various precautions and have enhanced controls around our systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial\nresults, if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner.\nWe are dependent upon the quality of our personnel\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, for temporary assignments and projects, as well as internally, including in the areas of maintenance and protection of our systems. The availability of such skilled personnel is dependent upon a number of economic and demographic conditions. We may, in the future, find it difficult or costlier to hire such personnel in the face of competition from our competitors.\nIn addition, variations in the unemployment rate and higher wages sought by contingent workers in certain technical fields that continue to experience labor shortages could affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands in these fields and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are also dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management and the performance and productivity of our managers and in-house field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by the quality of services rendered. The loss of high quality personnel and members of management with significant experience in our industry without replacement by personnel with similar quality and experience may cause a significant disruption to our business. Moreover, the loss of key managers and field personnel could jeopardize existing customer relationships which may be based upon long-standing relationships with those managers and field personnel.\nOur ability to retain acceptable insurance coverage limits at commercially reasonable cost and terms may adversely impact our financial results\nWe cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and at commercially reasonable cost, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies. Our coverage under certain insurance policies is limited and the losses that we may face may not be covered, may be subject to high deductibles or may exceed the limits purchased.\nSome customers require extensive insurance coverage and request insurance endorsements that are not available under standard monoline policies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable compromises with customers or negotiate appropriate changes in our insurance contracts. This may adversely affect our ability to take on new customers or accepted changes in insurance terms with existing customers.\nUnexpected changes in workers' compensation and other insurance plans may negatively impact our financial condition\nWe purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance through mandated participation in certain state funds, and the experience-rated premiums in these state plans relieve the Company of any additional liability. Liability for workers\u2019 compensation in all other states as well as automobile and general liability is insured under a paid loss deductible casualty insurance program for losses exceeding specified deductible levels. We are financially responsible for losses below the specified deductible limits.\nThe Company is self-insured for a portion of its medical benefit programs. The liability for the self-insured medical benefits is limited on a per-claimant basis through the purchase of stop-loss insurance. The Company\u2019s retained liability for the self-insured medical benefits is determined by utilizing actuarial estimates of expected claims based on statistical analysis of historical data.\nUnexpected changes related to our workers\u2019 compensation, medical and disability benefit plans may negatively impact our financial condition. Changes in the severity and frequency of claims, state laws regarding benefit levels and allowable claims, actuarial estimates, or medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly higher. If future claims-related liabilities increase beyond our expectations, or if we must make unfavorable adjustments to accruals for prior accident years, our costs could increase significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover the increased costs that result from any changes in claims-related liabilities.\nDecline in our operating results could lead to impairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets\nWe regularly monitor our International Staffing goodwill as well as company-wide long-lived assets for impairment indicators. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur stock price could be volatile and, as a result, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them\nOur stock price has in the past, and could in the future, fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the expectations of the investment community or our estimates of our future results of operations;\n\u2022\nindustry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of one or more key customers;\n\u2022\nstrategic moves by our competitors, such as product or service announcements or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nother domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022\nany of the other previously noted risk factors.\nThe stock market has experienced, and is likely to in the future experience, volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain shareholders, whose interests may differ from those of other shareholders, own a significant percentage of our common stock and are able to exercise significant influence over Volt\nOwnership of a significant amount of our outstanding common stock is concentrated among certain substantial shareholders, including related family members and certain funds. Although there can be no assurance as to how these shareholders will vote, if they were to vote in the same manner, certain combinations of these shareholders might be able to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval and could have significant influence over our affairs. The interests of our substantial shareholders may not align with those of our other shareholders.\nFurthermore, the provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law, to which we are subject, require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of all of our outstanding shares entitled to vote to adopt a plan of merger or consolidation between us and another entity and to approve any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets not made in our usual and regular course of business. Accordingly, our substantial shareholders, acting together, could prevent the approval of such transactions even if such transactions are in the best interests of our other shareholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting or other shareholder activism\nA proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. The potential of a proxy contest or other shareholder activism could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key business partners, result in the loss of potential business opportunities or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties related to stockholder activism.\nNew York State law and our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain provisions that could make corporate ownership changes at Volt more difficult\nCertain provisions of New York State law and our articles of incorporation and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring Volt, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws include:\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees;\n\u2022\npermitting removal of directors only for cause; and\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on the Board of Directors will be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office.", "PERMNO": 81190, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "VOLT"}
