{"cik": "890491", "company": "BARNES & NOBLE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-06-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations. Management\u2019s strategies are subject to the risks described herein and elsewhere, and may be subject to other risks that have not yet been identified, and management cannot make assurances that its business strategies will be successful. If any of the following risks occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nUnless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references below to (1) \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to Barnes & Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (2) \u201cRetail business\u201d refer to the Company\u2019s business included in the Retail segment, and (3) \u201cDigital business\u201d refer to the Company\u2019s business included in the NOOK segment, including the sales of digital content, devices and accessories.\nRisks related to the Merger.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees, suppliers, customers and other third parties may disrupt our sales, merchandising or other key business activities and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger and this may have an effect on our corporate culture. There can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees. Any loss or distraction of such employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management and other internal resources towards the completion of the Merger and planning for integration, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe failure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock as well as adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to several conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way, including those described below. The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied or, even if satisfied, that no event of termination will take place. In the event that the Merger is not completed for any reason, the holders of Company Common Stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and the holders of Company Common Stock will continue to own their shares of Company Common Stock.\nThe completion of the Merger will be conditioned on certain mutual conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, voting together as a single class; (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; and (iii) the absence of any order or law that has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (ii) the compliance by the other party in all material respects with its pre-closing obligations under the Merger Agreement. Parent\u2019s and Merger Sub\u2019s respective obligations to consummate the Merger are also conditioned upon the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of Company Common Stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. We could be required to pay Parent termination fees of up to $17.5 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the Merger Agreement. The failure to complete the Merger also may result in negative publicity and negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees, collaborators, customers, regulators and other business partners. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or deter a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to effect an alternative transaction with us.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are generally not permitted to solicit or discuss takeover proposals with third parties, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, provide non-public information to third parties and engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions.\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger Agreement.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger Agreement. A material portion of these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed. There are a number of factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses.\nIntense competition, including from the Internet and other retail sources, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThe book business is highly competitive in every channel in which the Company operates. The Company competes with mass merchandisers, such as Costco, Target and Wal-Mart. The Company faces competition from many online distributors, notably Amazon.com. The Company also competes with other large bookstores, including Books-A-Million, and smaller format bookstores, including new Amazon retail stores and independent store operators. In addition, the Company faces competition from digital distributors, such as Amazon.com and Apple, including through digital books or \u201ceBooks\u201d and eBook readers. The Retail business\u2019s stores also compete with specialty retail stores that offer books in particular subject areas, variety discounters, drug stores, warehouse clubs, mail-order clubs and other retailers offering books, music, toys, games, gifts and other products in its market segments.\nSome of the Company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial and other resources and different business strategies than the Company does. New and enhanced technologies, including new digital technologies and new web services technologies, may increase the Company\u2019s competition. Competition may also intensify as the Company\u2019s competitors enter into business combinations or alliances or established companies in other market segments expand into its market segments. Increased competition may reduce the Company\u2019s sales and profits.\nThe Retail business\u2019s stores compete primarily on the quality of the shopping and store experience and the price and availability of products. The importance of price varies depending on the competitor, with some of the Retail business\u2019s competitors engaging in significant discounting and other promotional activities.\nBecause of shifting consumer preferences and demographic shifts, coupled with the maturity of the market for traditional retail stores, the Company\u2019s sales or net income may decline unless it successfully implements its business strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary business is its operation of the Retail business\u2019s stores across the United States, and it derived a substantial majority of its sales and profits from the Retail business\u2019s stores in its most recent fiscal year. Continued increases in consumer spending via the Internet, and the disintermediation of information, may significantly affect its ability to generate sales in the Retail business\u2019s stores and the Company\u2019s other channels of sale. The Retail business\u2019s stores have experienced declining sales trends primarily due to lower traffic. Failure of the Company to implement successful strategies to account for such changing consumer preferences may result in the decline in the Company\u2019s sales and/or net income.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent on the overall economic environment and consumer spending patterns.\nA deterioration of the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to fund its growth or its strategic business initiatives.\nThe Retail and Digital businesses\u2019 sales are primarily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending, which is affected by the overall economic environment, consumer confidence and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. In addition, the Retail and Digital businesses\u2019 sales are dependent in part on the strength of new release products, which are controlled by publishers and other suppliers.\nThe Company faces the risk of disruption of supplier relationships and/or supply chain and/or inventory surplus.\nThe products that the Company sells originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During fiscal 2019, the Retail business\u2019s five largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the dollar value of merchandise purchased. While the Company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are strong, suppliers may modify the terms of these relationships due to general economic conditions or otherwise. The Company does not have long-term arrangements with most of its suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components or services, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. If the Company\u2019s current suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content, components or services to it on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions or otherwise as a result of decisions to exit or decrease its wholesale and/or distribution businesses, the Company may be unable to procure the same merchandise, content, components or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe Retail business is dependent on the continued supply of trade books. A significant disruption in the publishing industry generally could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. A significant unfavorable change in the Company\u2019s relationships with key suppliers could materially adversely affect its sales and profits. In addition, any significant change in the payment terms that the Company has with its key suppliers, including payment terms, return policies, the discount or margin on products or changes to the distribution model could adversely affect its financial condition and liquidity. In addition, changes to the Company\u2019s merchandise assortment, such as a higher volume of non-returnable non-book categories, may place a strain on its supply chain practices, which are primarily built for book offerings.\nThe Company has arrangements with third-party manufacturers with respect to digital devices. These manufacturers procure and assemble unfinished parts and components from third-party suppliers based on forecasts provided by the Company. Given production lead times, commitments may be made far in advance of finished product delivery. In addition, certain of our merchandise, including electronic readers and certain book, gift and other non-book product, are sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, including, without limitation, from suppliers in China. General trade tensions between the U.S. and China began escalating in 2018, with multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect. Furthermore, China or other countries may institute retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future tariffs imposed by the U.S. that could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. If any of these events continue as described, the Company may need to seek alternative suppliers or vendors, raise prices, or make changes to its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales and profitability, results of operations and financial condition. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of foreign-sourced merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to manage its inventory effectively, the Company\u2019s merchandise margins could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends upon its ability to manage appropriate inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns. The Company must properly execute its inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among its stores and online, timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores and online, adjusting its merchandise mix, appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and\nmarkdowns. If the Company overestimates customer demand for its non-returnable merchandise, it will likely need to record inventory markdowns and sell the excess inventory at clearance prices which would negatively impact its merchandise margins and operating results. If the Company underestimates customer demand for its merchandise, the Company may experience inventory shortages which may result in missed sales opportunities and have a negative impact on customer loyalty. Higher than expected levels of lost or stolen inventory (called shrinkage) could result in write-offs and lost sales, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nIf the Retail business is unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, or at all, or fails to maintain the upkeep of its stores, its sales and earnings may decline.\nSubstantially all of the Retail business\u2019s stores are located in leased premises. The Retail business\u2019s profitability depends in part on its ability to continue to optimize its store lease portfolio as to the number of retail stores, store locations and lease terms and conditions. Its ability to do so depends on, among other things, general economic and business conditions and general real estate development conditions, which are beyond its control. The Retail business has 341 leases up for renewal by April 30, 2022. If the cost of leasing existing retail stores increases, the Retail business may not be able to maintain its existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, the Retail business may not be able to enter into new leases on acceptable terms, or at all, or it may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new retail stores in a timely manner. The Retail business\u2019s sales and earnings may decline if it fails to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, renew leases or relocate to alternative sites, in each case on attractive terms. The Company is opening newly designed prototype stores, which may negatively impact its earnings and cash flows if the performance of such stores falls short of forecasted expectations. In addition, the Retail business\u2019 sales and earnings may decline if the Company fails to maintain the upkeep of its stores, such that the Company\u2019s stores fail to attract customers to browse and buy the Company\u2019s products.\nIn addition to the bookstores, the Company leases two distribution centers for its B&N Retail operations: one in Monroe Township, New Jersey and the other in Reno, Nevada. The Retail business\u2019s profitability depends in part on its ability to continue to optimize its distribution centers. Its ability to do so depends on, among other things, general economic and business conditions and general real estate development conditions, which are beyond its control. The Reno distribution center lease is up for renewal in 2020 and the Monroe distribution center lease is up for renewal in 2025. If the cost of leasing these distribution centers increases, the Retail business may not be able to maintain its existing distribution centers as leases expire. In addition, the Retail business may not be able to enter into new leases on acceptable terms, or at all, or it may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or in a timely manner. The Retail business\u2019s earnings may decline if it fails to maintain existing distribution centers, enter into new leases, renew leases or relocate to alternative sites, in each case on attractive terms.\nHarm to the Company\u2019s reputation could adversely impact its ability to attract and retain customers and employees.\nNegative publicity or perceptions involving the Company or its brands, products, vendors, spokespersons, or marketing and other partners may negatively impact its reputation and adversely impact its ability to attract and retain customers and employees. Failure to detect, prevent, or mitigate issues that might give rise to reputational risk or failure to adequately address negative publicity or perceptions could adversely impact its reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Issues that might pose a reputational risk include an inability to achieve its omni-channel goals, including providing an eCommerce and delivery experience that meets the expectations of consumers; failure of our cyber-security measures to protect against data breaches; product liability and product recalls; changes in executive management; the Company\u2019s social media activity; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; public stances on controversial social or political issues; and any of the other risks enumerated in these risk factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of any negative publicity the Company might receive and could increase the negative impact of these issues on its reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent upon access to capital, including bank credit facilities and short-term vendor financing, for its liquidity needs.\nThe Company must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its working capital requirements and indebtedness. The Company believes that the combination of its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow received from operations, funds available under the Company\u2019s credit facility and short-term vendor financing will be sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s normal working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of liquidity do not satisfy the Company\u2019s requirements, the Company may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and the Company\u2019s credit rating, as well as the Company\u2019s reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fund its working capital requirements, costs of borrowing, and the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s expansion into new products, services and technologies subjects it to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.\nThe Company may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s gross profits and margins in its newer activities may be lower than in its traditional activities, and it may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup its investments in them. In addition, the Company may have limited or no experience in newer products and services, and its customers may not adopt to any such new product or service offerings. Some of these offerings may present new and difficult challenges. The Company may be subject to claims or recalls if customers of technology offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. If any of these were to occur, it could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, limit its growth and negatively affect its operating results.\nThe complexity of the Company\u2019s businesses could place a significant strain on its management, operations, performance and resources.\nThe complexity of the Company\u2019s businesses could place a significant strain on its management, operations, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. The Company operates two different businesses: the Retail business and the Digital business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to manage the complexity of its businesses effectively. The Company\u2019s current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage its future operations, especially as it employs personnel in multiple geographic locations. The Company may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage the required personnel, which may limit its growth. If any of these were to occur, it could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, limit growth, negatively affect operating results and harm its business. Additionally, the Company\u2019s inability to maintain recent cost rationalizations in its Digital and Retail businesses, or to further streamline costs in its businesses, may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, if the Company was to reduce costs too deeply or too quickly, unintended consequences may adversely impact its operations, resources and financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s relationship with strategic partners could have adverse impacts on the Company and its business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide certain services for its business. The Company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted if such third parties fail to meet their obligations or to provide high levels of service to the Company\u2019s customers. Further, the Company could be subject to claims as a result of the activities, products or services provided by these third-party service providers even though the Company was not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims. These claims could include, among other things, claims by the Company\u2019s customers and claims relating to data security. Even if these claims do not result in liability to the Company, defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from the Company\u2019s business and result in adverse publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond its control. These factors include the timing of new product releases, announcements relating to strategic decisions such as the Merger, supply chain execution, the level of success of the Company\u2019s product releases, the timing of store openings and closings, weather, shifts in the timing of certain promotions and the effect of impairments on the Company\u2019s assets. These and other factors could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, and this makes the prediction of the Company\u2019s financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. The Company\u2019s quarterly financial results have been and may in the future be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are generally highest in the third fiscal quarter and lowest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Operating results in the Company\u2019s businesses depend significantly upon the holiday selling season in the third fiscal quarter.\nLess than satisfactory net sales during the Company\u2019s peak fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results for the year, and the Company\u2019s results of operations from those quarters may not be sufficient to cover any losses, which may be incurred in the other fiscal quarters of the year.\nThe Company faces data security risks with respect to personal information.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the receipt, storage, processing and transmission of personal information about customers and employees. Personal information about customers is obtained in connection with the Company\u2019s membership programs, eCommerce operations, digital media businesses, as well as through retail transactions in stores operated by the Company. The Company\u2019s online operations and the Digital business depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. We may share such information with vendors and third parties that assist with certain aspects of our business.\nThe Company\u2019s handling and use of personal information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. Privacy and information security laws, regulations, and standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and the California Consumer Privacy Act, change from time to time, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes and may be difficult to achieve. If the Company fails to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, it could be subjected to legal risk. Also, hardware, software or applications developed or procured internally or from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. In addition, even if the Company fully complies with all laws, regulations, and standards and even though the Company has taken significant steps to protect personal information, the Company could experience a data security breach, and its reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future sales or decreased usage of credit and debit card products. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A\nparty that is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures could misappropriate the Company\u2019s or its users\u2019 proprietary information and cause interruption in its operations. Any compromise of the Company\u2019s data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage, increased operating costs associated with remediation, negative publicity, equipment acquisitions or disposal and added personnel, and a loss of confidence in its security measures, which could harm the business or investor confidence. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe Company regards its trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as important to its success, and it relies on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements to protect its proprietary rights. Laws and regulations may not adequately protect its trademarks and similar proprietary rights. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nThe Company may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of its proprietary rights. The protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps it takes to protect its intellectual property may not adequately protect its rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating its proprietary rights. The Company also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that the Company infringes their proprietary rights. Because of the changes in Internet commerce, the electronic reader and digital content business, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. Because the Company\u2019s products include complex technology, much of which is acquired from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software, the Company and its suppliers and customers are and have been involved in or have been impacted by assertions, including both requests for licenses and litigation, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. The Company has been and is currently subject to, and expects to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by it of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against the Company prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or the payment of damages. The Company may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that it has infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to it, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property it does not own in providing services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose primary business appears to be to assert such claims. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against the Company by any third-party is successful, if the Company is required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if the Company is unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, the Company\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s digital content offerings, including NOOK\u00ae, depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that it uses is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, the Company could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in its service.\nThe concentration of the Company\u2019s capital stock ownership with certain executive officers, directors and their affiliates limits its stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may involve other risks.\nMr. Riggio is currently the beneficial owner of an aggregate of approximately 19.2% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock as of April 27, 2019.\nThis concentrated control may limit the ability of the Company\u2019s other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take certain actions, with which its other stockholders do not agree. In addition, there may be risks related to the relationships Leonard Riggio and other members of the Riggio family have with the various entities with which the Company has related party transactions.\nPursuant to the Voting Agreement, the Significant Stockholders agreed, among other things and subject to certain conditions, to, at any meeting of stockholders of the Company called to vote upon the approval of the Merger, vote all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such significant stockholders in favor of the Merger, and to vote against certain other matters, so long as such obligations have not terminated in accordance with the terms set forth therein. The Voting Agreement may be amended in connection with an amendment to the Merger Agreement, as discussed above in Item I \u201cBusiness-Merger Agreement,\u201d to provide that the shares of Company Common Stock held by the Significant Stockholders be tendered in any tender offer contemplated by such amendment to the Merger Agreement.\nChanges in sales and other tax collection regulations or inability of the Company to utilize tax credits or assets, could harm the Company\u2019s businesses or financial performance.\nThe Retail business and the Digital business collected sales tax on the majority of the products and services that they sold in their respective prior fiscal years that were subject to sales tax, and they generally have continued the same policies for sales tax within the current fiscal year. While management believes that the financial statements included elsewhere herein reflect management\u2019s best current estimate of any potential additional sales tax liability based on current discussions with taxing authorities, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any discussions with any taxing authority will not result in the payment of sales taxes for prior periods or otherwise, or that the amount of any such payments will not be materially in excess of any liability currently recorded. In the future, the Company\u2019s businesses may be subject to claims for not collecting sales tax on the products and services it currently sells for which sales tax is not collected. There is a risk that existing tax credits and tax assets may not be utilized or may expire.\nThe Spin-Off of Barnes & Noble Education could result in significant tax liability to the Company and its stockholders.\nThe Spin-Off was conditioned on the Company\u2019s receipt of written opinions from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and KPMG LLP to the effect that the Spin-Off would qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss to the Company and its stockholders, which were received. These opinions do not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the Spin-Off. These opinions assume that the Spin-Off will be completed according to the terms of the Separation Agreement and rely on the facts as stated in the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, the prospectus for the Spin-Off and a number of other documents. In addition, these opinions are based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, the Company and Barnes & Noble Education. The opinions cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the courts, and we cannot assure you that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. If the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, U.S. holders could be subject to tax. In this case, each U.S. holder who receives the Barnes & Noble Education common stock in the Spin-Off would generally be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of Barnes & Noble Education common stock received, which would generally result in (i) a taxable dividend to the U.S. holder to the extent of that U.S. holder\u2019s pro rata share of the Company\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the U.S. holder\u2019s basis (but not below zero) in the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder\u2019s share of the Company\u2019s earnings and profits; and (iii) a taxable gain from the exchange of the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. holder\u2019s share of the Company\u2019s earnings and profits and the U.S. holder\u2019s basis in its common stock.\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, then the Company would recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the Barnes & Noble Education stock held by the Company immediately before the Spin-Off.\nThe Company\u2019s Shareholder Rights Plan and other anti-takeover defenses could deter acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third-party to acquire control of the Company. This could have a negative effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company adopted a short-term Shareholder Rights Plan (Rights Agreement) on October 3, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated as of June 6, 2019, expiring on the earliest of (i) the Close of Business (as defined in the Rights Agreement) on October 2, 2019, (ii) the time at which all Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) are redeemed, and (iii) immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and also has other anti-takeover defenses in its certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Additionally, pursuant to the stockholder proposal that was approved at the Company\u2019s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the declassification of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is being phased in, such that the Class II directors stood for election for a one-year term at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, and the Class II directors and the Class III directors will stand for election for a one-year term at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and all directors will stand for election for one-year terms at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and at each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter. Until declassification is complete, the Company\u2019s classified Board of Directors could serve as an anti-takeover defense. Each of the Company\u2019s defenses could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. These deterrents could adversely affect the price of Company common stock and make it difficult to remove or replace members of the Board of Directors or management of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses could be impacted by changes in international, federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations.\nThe Company is subject to general business regulations and laws relating to all aspects of its business, including regulations and laws relating to the Internet, online commerce, digital content and products as well as its other lines of business. Changes in international, federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations, including, but not limited to, laws, rules or regulations related to employment, wages, data privacy, information security, intellectual property, taxes, products, product safety, health and safety, imports and exports, anti-corruption, and anti-competition could diminish the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business, decrease the Company\u2019s margins or otherwise materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. Existing and future laws and regulations and their application and/or enforcement may impede the growth of the Internet, digital content distribution or other online services and impact digital content pricing, including requiring modifications or elimination of related pricing models, including the agency pricing model.\nThe Company faces additional operating risks through the operation of the Digital business and as an Internet retailer.\nThe Company faces risks related to the operation of the Digital business. The Digital business\u2019s content sales decreased during fiscal 2019 and may continue to decline in the future, which could affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and liquidity. Also, the sales of digital devices and accessories declined during fiscal 2019, and there is no guarantee that the possible introduction of future NOOK\u00ae digital devices will increase future sales of digital devices or content or the earnings of the Digital business. NOOK\u00ae competes primarily with other tablets and eBook readers on functionality, consumer appeal, availability of digital content and price. The Digital business faces certain risks associated with its business, including protection of digital rights and uncertainties relating to the regulation of digital content.\nBusiness risks related to the Company\u2019s online business include risks associated with the need to keep pace with rapid technological change, risks associated with the adoption of new products or platforms.\nInternet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, supply chain risks, government regulation and legal uncertainties with respect to the Internet, risks related to data privacy and collection of sales or other taxes by one or more states or foreign jurisdictions. If any of these risks materializes, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S.\nNOOK\u00ae and other Company products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, many of which are located outside the United States. While the Company\u2019s arrangements with these manufacturers may lower costs, they also reduce its direct control over production. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, if reimbursement from such manufacturers is unenforceable or insufficient, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company, including the Digital business, may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components and parts that are free of minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC), which could result in a shortage of such components and parts or reputational damages if the Company is unable to certify that its products are free of such minerals. The Company filed its Conflict Minerals Report for the calendar year 2018 with the SEC on May 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on certain key personnel.\nManagement believes that the Company\u2019s continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain key personnel of the Company. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company does not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of its officers or other employees. On October 3, 2018, the Company announced a review of strategic alternatives. While the Company has implemented measures to retain key employees, such as retention and change in control plans, the uncertainty such a review presents may increase the risk of turnover of key personnel throughout the organization.\nThe Company relies on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content, including on NOOK\u00ae and through its eBookstore. Its licensing arrangements with these third parties do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, its financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 79667, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "BKS"}
