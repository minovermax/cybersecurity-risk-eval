RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully review and consider the following risk factors and the other information contained in this 2020 Form 10-K. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business or financial condition. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.\nSummary of Risk Factors:\nThe following list provides a summary our risk factors discussed in further detail below:\nIndustry-related risks including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in the prices of gold and silver;\n\u2022Uncertainties concerning estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources;\n\u2022Uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022The intense competition within the mining industry;\n\u2022The inherently hazardous nature of mining activities, including environmental risks;\n\u2022Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all risks associated with our business, or cover the replacement costs of our assets or may not be available for some risks;\n\u2022Potential effects on our operations of U.S. federal and state governmental regulations, including environmental regulation and permitting requirements;\n\u2022Cost of compliance with current and future government regulations;\n\u2022Uncertainties relating to obtaining or retaining approvals and permits from governmental regulatory authorities;\n\u2022Potential challenges to title in our mineral properties;\n\u2022Risks associated with proposed legislation in Nevada that could significantly increase the costs or taxation of our operations; and\n\u2022Changes to the climate and regulations and pending legislation regarding climate change.\nBusiness-related risks including:\n\u2022Risks related to our liquidity and going concern considerations;\n\u2022Risks related to our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022Risks related to the proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process at the Hycroft Mine and estimates of production;\n\u2022Our ability to achieve our estimated production and sales rates and stay within our estimated operating and production costs and capital expenditure projections;\n\u2022Risks related to a decline in our gold and silver production;\n\u2022Our ability to successfully eliminate or meaningfully reduce processing and mining constraints; the results of our planned 2021 technical efforts and how the data resulting from such efforts could adversely impact processing technologies applied to our ore, future operations and profitability.\n\u2022Risks related to our reliance on one mine with a new process;\n\u2022Risks related to our limited experience with a largely untested process of oxidizing and heap leaching sulfide ore;\n\u2022Uncertainties and risks related to our reliance on contractors and consultants;\n\u2022Availability and cost of equipment, supplies, energy, or commodities;\n\u2022The commercial success of, and risks relating to, our development activities;\n\u2022Risks related to slope stability;\n\u2022Risks related to our substantial indebtedness, including cross acceleration and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022Uncertainties resulting from the possible incurrence of operating and net losses in the future;\n\u2022Uncertainties related to our ability to replace and expand our mineral reserves;\n\u2022The costs related to our land reclamation requirements;\n\u2022The loss of key personnel or our failure to attract and retain personnel;\n\u2022Risks related to technology systems and security breaches; and\n\u2022Risks that our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nRisks related to our common stock and warrants, including:\n\u2022Volatility in the price of our common stock and warrants;\n\u2022Risks that warrants may expire worthless;\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult; and\n\u2022Risks related to limited access to our financial information, as we have elected to take advantage of the disclosure requirement exemptions granted to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies.\nIndustry-Related Risks\nThe market prices of gold and silver are volatile. A decline in gold and silver prices could result in decreased revenues, decreased net income, increased losses and decreased cash inflows which may negatively affect our business.\nGold and silver are commodities. Their prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, central bank activities, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. The prices of gold and silver, as quoted by The London Bullion Market Association on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, were $1,888 and $1,515 per ounce for gold, respectively, and $26.49 and $18.04 per ounce for silver, respectively. The prices of gold and silver may decline in the future. A substantial or extended decline in gold or silver prices would adversely impact our financial position, revenues, net income and cash flows, particularly in light of our current strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or silver. In addition, sustained lower gold or silver prices may:\n\u2022reduce revenue potential due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at the then-prevailing gold or silver price;\n\u2022reduce or eliminate the profit, if any, that we currently expect from mining operations;\n\u2022halt, delay, modify, or cancel plans for the mining of oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores or the development of new and existing projects;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy and/or service our debt obligations;\n\u2022reduce existing mineral reserves by removing ores from mineral reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices; and\n\u2022cause us to recognize an impairment to the carrying values of long-lived assets.\nMineral reserve and mineral resource calculations are estimates only and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices, inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of metal in the mining process.\nThe calculation of mineral reserves, mineral resources and grades are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of mineral reserves and mineral resources, and corresponding grades. Until mineral reserves and mineral resources are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineral reserves and mineral resources may vary depending on metal prices, which largely determine whether mineral reserves and mineral resources are classified as ore (economic to mine) or waste (uneconomic to mine). A decline in metal prices may result in previously reported mineral reserves (ore) becoming uneconomic to mine (waste). Current mineral reserve estimates were calculated using sales prices of $1,200 per ounce of gold price and $16.50 per ounce of silver. A material decline in the current price of gold or silver or material changes in our processing methods could require a reduction in our mineral reserve estimates. Any material change in the quantity of mineral reserves, mineral resources, mineralization, grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, we can provide no assurance that gold and silver recoveries experienced in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have led to a significant decline of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. An outbreak could adversely affect our operations if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work or travel effectively for a prolonged period because of government-mandated quarantines, closures, or other restrictions, then our business and financial operations will be significantly impacted and could result in a temporary shutdown of the Hycroft Mine. The continued spread of coronavirus without any impact from effective vaccines or therapeutic treatments may cause further financial instability, and disruptions to our supply chain, which could increase supply costs or prevent us from procuring the supplies necessary to operate the Hycroft Mine. We cannot at this time predict the duration of the coronavirus pandemic or the impact of government regulations that might be imposed in response of the pandemic; however, the coronavirus pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in the mining industry.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive, some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial mining capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours. We compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees and in acquiring attractive mining claims. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees, our development programs and/or our operations may be slowed down or suspended, which may adversely impact our development, financial condition and results of operations.\nMining development and processing operations pose inherent risks and costs that may negatively impact our business.\nMining development and processing operations involve many hazards and uncertainties, including, among others:\n\u2022metallurgical or other processing problems;\n\u2022ground or slope failures;\n\u2022industrial accidents;\n\u2022unusual and unexpected rock formations or water conditions;\n\u2022environmental contamination or leakage;\n\u2022flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of nature;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022seismic activity;\n\u2022organized labor disputes or work slow-downs or civil disturbances, including road closures or blockades;\n\u2022pandemics adversely affecting the availability of workforces and supplies;\n\u2022mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems; and\n\u2022the availability of critical materials, equipment and skilled labor.\nThese occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, our properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, increased production costs, asset write downs, monetary losses and legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our projected development and production estimates.\nOur insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with our business.\nThe mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including, but not limited to, construction risks, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, slide-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties mining equipment or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many of these risks is not generally available to us and if it is, we may elect not to obtain it because of the high premium costs or commercial impracticality. We do not currently carry business interruption insurance, but may obtain such insurance in the future. Any liabilities incurred for these risks and hazards could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nEnvironmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability.\nTo the extent we become subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur, including costs to remedy environmental pollution, would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental violation or release of hazardous substances, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy or corrective action. The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site can vary and may impact the cost of remediation. Actual remedial costs may exceed the financial accruals that have been made for such remediation. Additionally, the timing of the remedial costs may be materially different from the current remediation plan. The potential exposure may be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property or natural resources and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations, which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties, injunctive relief and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including those required to restore the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot provide any assurance that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which could result in operational delays, penalties and costs.\nAll phases of our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation, including those enacted under the following laws:\n\u2022Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act;\n\u2022Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;\n\u2022Clean Air Act;\n\u2022National Environmental Policy Act;\n\u2022Clean Water Act;\n\u2022Safe Drinking Water Act;\n\u2022Federal Land Policy and Land Management Act; and\n\u2022Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act;\nAdditional regulatory authorities also have jurisdiction over some of our operations and mining projects including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, BLM, and the Nevada Department of Wildlife.\nThese environmental regulations require us to obtain various operating permits, approvals and licenses and also impose standards and controls relating to development and production activities. For instance, we are required to hold a Nevada Reclamation Permit with respect to the Hycroft Mine. This permit mandates concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and requires the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Changes to the amount required to be posted for reclamation bonds for our operations at the Hycroft Mine could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity following consummation of the business combination. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for our development. For example, we had to obtain certain permits associated with mining in the area of an eagle habitat. Failure to obtain such required permits or failure to comply with federal and state regulations could also result in delays in beginning or expanding operations, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of penalties for non-compliance or discharge of pollutants, and post-mining closure, reclamation and bonding, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity.\nCompliance with current and future government regulations may cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal and state legislation governing matters such as mine safety, occupational health, labor standards, prospecting, exploration, production, exports, toxic and hazardous substances, explosives, management of natural resources, land use, water use, air emissions, waste disposal, environmental review and taxes. Compliance with this and other legislation could require us to make significant financial outlays. The enactment of new legislation or more stringent enforcement of current legislation may increase costs, which could have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, to federal laws or regulations may be adopted or imposed by the new Biden Administration. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to adapt to these regulatory developments on a timely or cost-effective basis. Violations of these laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements could lead to substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, including possible shutdown of the Hycroft Mine or future operations, as applicable.\nChanges in environmental regulations could adversely affect our cost of operations or result in operational delays.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. New environmental laws and regulations or changes in existing environmental laws and regulations could have a negative effect on exploration activities, operations, production levels and methods of production.\nWe cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, to federal laws or regulations may be adopted or imposed by the new Biden Administration. We cannot provide any assurance that future changes in environmental laws and regulations will not adversely affect our current operations or future projects. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or financial assurance requirements.\nOur operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed.\nIn the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our operations, including in connection with our plans for heap leaching our sulfide ore at the Hycroft Mine. We will also need additional governmental permits to accomplish our long-term plans to mine sulfide ores, including without limitation, permits to allow construction of additional leach pad space. Obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving costly undertakings by us. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations on a timely basis or at all, and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates. Failure to comply with the terms of our permits may result in injunctions, fines, suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties. We can provide no assurance that we have been, or will at all times be, in full compliance with all of the terms of our permits or that we have all required permits. The costs and delays associated with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could alter all or a portion of our life of mine plan, delay or stop us from proceeding with the operation or development of the Hycroft Mine or increase the costs of development or production, any or all of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThere are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations.\nOur mineral properties consist of private mineral rights, leases covering private lands, leases of patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims. Areas of the Hycroft Mine are unpatented mining claims located on lands administered by the BLM, Nevada State office to which we have only possessory title. Because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims. These uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper location and posting and marking of boundaries, and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. We believe a substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, and this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry.\nThe present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the right to mine and remove valuable minerals, such as precious and base metals, from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs. We also are generally allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. However, legal ownership of the land remains with the United States. We remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the United States or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements. Prior to 1994, a mining claim locator who was able to prove the discovery of valuable, locatable minerals on a mining claim, and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims, had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the mining claim from the Federal government. The right to pursue a patent, however, has been subject to a moratorium since October 1994, through federal legislation restricting the BLM from accepting any new mineral patent applications. If we do not obtain fee title to our unpatented mining claims, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain compensation in connection with the forfeiture of such claims.\nThere may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest. If there are title defects with respect to any properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management\u2019s time from ongoing production and development programs.\nLegislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of our operations on our unpatented mining claims or the amount of Net Proceeds of Mineral Tax we pay to the State of Nevada.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress have periodically introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the Mining Law of 1872. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims. Such proposed legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims. A majority of our mining claims are unpatented claims. Although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be, the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of our unpatented mining claims and the economics of our existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe are subject to Net Proceeds of Mineral Tax, which we refer to as \u201cNPT,\u201d to the State of Nevada on up to 5% of net proceeds generated from our Hycroft Mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals. From time to time Nevada legislators introduce bills which aim to increase the amount of NPT mining companies operating in the state pay. As of the date of this filing, there are two proposed amendments to the NPT that would change the calculation of the NPT. Both of the amendments increase the rate of the tax, but one of the amendments would base NPT on gross proceeds instead of net proceeds. If legislation is passed that increases the NPT we pay to the State of Nevada, our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such regulations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.\nClimate change could have an adverse impact on our cost of operations.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the area in which we operate. These climate changes may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages and changing temperatures. These changes in climate could adversely affect our mining operations, including by affecting the moisture levels and pH of ore on our leach pads, increase the cost of production at the Hycroft Mine and materially and adversely affect the financial performance of our operations.\nBusiness-Related Risks\nDue to uncertainty surrounding our ability to achieve sales, production, cost and other operating targets, as well as our ability to consummate a future financing transaction to provide additional working capital and to fund capital projects in the future, substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful, and we may be forced to limit our business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a \u201cgoing concern\u201d basis, which contemplates the presumed continuation of the Company even though events and conditions exist that, when considered individually or in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because it is probable that, without additional capital injections, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date of this 2020 Form 10-K.\nWe restarted operations in 2019 and have incurred net losses, negative operating cash flow and required cash flow from financing to meet our operating and capital spending needs for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Based on our internal cash flow projection models, we currently forecast we will likely require additional cash from financing activities in less than 12 months from the filing date of this 2020 Form 10-K to meet our operating and investing requirements and future obligations as they become due. Our current cash flow projection models include the cash payments required pursuant to the Sprott Credit Agreement, which are currently estimated at $9.0 million over the next 12 months including interest payments.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon increasing sales, by achieving higher cost-effective operating tonnages and recovery rates as planned as well securing additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate expenses. You are cautioned that management\u2019s expectations regarding our liquidity and capital resources are based on a number of assumptions that we believe are reasonable but could prove to be incorrect. For example, our expectations are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, gold and silver recovery percentages and rates, production estimates, timing of oxidation, anticipated costs and other factors that are subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may require additional financing sooner than we expect to continue to operate our business, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, but such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nThe continuing operation of our Hycroft Mine and future development for mining and processing our mineral reserves and mineral resources will require significant investment. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of development or production at the Hycroft Mine. The covenants in the Sprott Credit Agreement could significantly limit our ability to secure new or additional credit facilities, increase our cost of borrowing, and make it difficult or impossible to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.\nOur primary future cash requirements for 2021 will be to fund capital projects, leases for mining equipment, technical work, augment or recommission process plant equipment, and pay for corporate costs including debt service requirements under the Sprott Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $56.4 million. Using current metal prices and our estimates of future metal sales volumes and costs, we currently expect to fund negative net cash flows from cash on hand during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Future development of the Hycroft Mine may require additional capital to fund expenditures including refurbishing and commissioning the North Merrill-Crowe plant, additional leach pad expansions, additional process plant operations, mining fleet additions, material handling equipment, a rail spur, and working capital. You are cautioned that management\u2019s expectations regarding our liquidity and capital resources are based on a number of assumptions that we believe are reasonable but could prove to be incorrect. For example, our expectations are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, gold and silver recovery percentages and rates, production estimates, anticipated costs and other factors that are subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may require additional financing sooner than we expect to continue to operate our business, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe estimation of the ultimate recovery of gold and silver from the Hycroft Mine, is based on standard industry sampling and estimating methods, which are subjective. Our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position may be negatively impacted if actual recoveries of gold and silver are lower than estimations.\nWe use several integrated steps to estimate the metal content of ore placed on the leach pad and the ultimate recovery of gold and silver based on the process projected to be applied to the various ore types. Although we refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the process, the final amounts are not determined until a third-party smelter refines the dor\u00e9 or metal-laden carbon and determines the final ounces of gold and silver available for sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production process. Based on this review, we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate. Due to the complexity of the estimation process and the number of steps involved, among other things, actual recoveries can vary from estimates, and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThere is only limited experience of recovering gold and silver from sulfide ores using a proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process and we may not be able to economically recover gold and silver.\nThe Hycroft Technical Report reflects extracting gold and silver from transitional and sulfide ores using a proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process on transitional and sulfide ores using soda ash to manage pH and alkalinity during the oxidation process. However, the economic parameters described in the Hycroft Technical Report include a number of assumptions and estimates that could prove to be incorrect. Additionally, this proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process to oxidize transitional and sulfide ores before heap leaching to extract gold and silver is a new and relatively untested process and it has not been widely accepted as a viable process. We cannot provide any assurance that the development and advancement of the Hycroft Mine using our proprietary two-stage heap and leach process will result in economically viable mining operations, yield new mineral reserves or mineral resources, enable us to convert other mineralized material (included within mineral resources identified by the Hycroft Technical Report), or be implemented on an economic and profitable basis.\nCost estimates of operating our Hycroft Mine are uncertain, which may adversely affect our expected production and profitability.\nThe expenditures to implement our proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process, and access our sulfide ore, are considerable and changes in processing requirements, costs, construction schedules, commodity prices and other factors can adversely affect project economics and expected production and profitability. There are a number of factors that can affect process requirements, costs and construction schedules and result in our assumptions and estimates about the anticipated benefits of a project being incorrect, including, among others:\n\u2022changes in input commodity prices and labor costs;\n\u2022process requirements vary by mineralogy and ore types;\n\u2022changes in estimates of prices and quantities of required reagents for processing, including cyanide, soda ash and lime;\n\u2022recovery rates of gold and silver from ore;\n\u2022availability and terms of financing;\n\u2022availability of labor, energy, transportation, equipment, and infrastructure;\n\u2022changes in anticipated tonnage, grade and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed;\n\u2022difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of years;\n\u2022delays in completing any environmental review or in obtaining environmental or other governmental permits;\n\u2022weather and severe climate impacts; and\n\u2022potential delays related to civil disturbances or social and community issues.\nWe have previously recovered gold and silver from oxide and transitional ores at the Hycroft Mine through our heap leach operations. In connection with our restarted mining operations, in addition to mining oxide ore, the Hycroft Technical Report reflects mining gold and silver sulfide ore using a modified heap leach process, in which soda ash is used in a two-stage heap oxidation and leach process. However, it is important to note that the economic parameters described in a feasibility study, such as the Hycroft Technical Report, include a number of assumptions and estimates that could prove to be incorrect. We use feasibility studies to make a reasoned determination of whether to proceed with a project and to support the required financing for a project, but you should not assume that the economic analysis contained in a feasibility study is a guarantee of future performance as projected in the feasibility study or that the estimated net present value or internal rates of return will be achieved. Actual results may differ materially. In particular, the processing of sulfide ore at the Hycroft Mine is uncertain and, therefore, the process requirements, recovery rates, reagent requirement assumptions, costs and timing of the commencement of the production of sulfide ore operations at the Hycroft Mine could vary greatly from our estimates. Further, we will continue to monitor and evaluate other processing technologies for their potential to process certain sulfide ores, but such technologies may not be economical.\nWe may not achieve our production and/or sales estimates and our costs may be higher than our estimates, thereby reducing our cash flows and negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe prepare estimates of future production, sales, and costs for our operations. We develop our estimates based on, among other things, mining experience, processing and mining fleet equipment reliability, operational efficiencies, recovery methods, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores (such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics), costs to construct new leach pads and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing. All of our estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Our actual production and/or sales may be lower than our estimates and our actual costs may be higher than our estimates, which could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable at the time they are made, actual results will vary and such variations may be material. These estimates are speculative in nature, and it may be the case that one or more of the assumptions underlying such projections and estimates may not materialize. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the projections and estimates set forth in this 2020 Form 10-K or any document incorporated by reference.\nPlans for eliminating or reducing processing and mining constraints and planned technical efforts in 2021, each aimed at positioning us for a future ramp up in production, may not be successful, could result in information which could adversely impact conclusions in the Hycroft Technical Report and/or could provide data, information or test results that could materially and adversely impact our processing technology, potential future output, results of operations and profitability.\nIn 2021, we expect to continue to more fully evaluate potential opportunities while we also position the Hycroft Mine for ramping up production at the appropriate time. We intend to focus much of our technical efforts for 2021 on, among other things, (1) using our internal technical team to complete a variety of technical analyses and studies; (2) further refine operating parameters of our proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process in order to position ourselves for large-scale application of the oxidation heap leach; and (3) engaging engineering firms to assess and evaluate potential design changes to the current leach pad and unit operations to better support the sulfide oxidation process. While each of these actions is intended to provide us with additional data on which we can assess potential efficiencies and operational improvements and such information provided from these activities could result in updates to the existing Hycroft Technical Report or a new Technical Report including consideration of multiple processing technologies, no assurances can be given that the results of this ongoing technical work in 2021 will enhance or improve our ability to efficiently and successfully access the ore within the Hycroft Mine. Further, while these technical efforts are intended to allow us to ramp up the Hycroft Mine at the appropriate time, that future ramp up is dependent on eliminating current mining and processing constraints. We expect that we will need to acquire an expanded mining fleet capable of mining targeted production rates, and recruit and train operators and maintenance staff. Additional resources must also be spent on enhancing our processing plant capabilities. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully eliminate these mining and processing constraints.\nAs information, test results, and data becomes available to us resulting from our 2021 technical efforts, that information may lead us to modify the scope, nature, and timing of technical, testing, engineering, and growth planning work actually performed. If the results of our technical efforts do not result in increased efficiencies and capabilities and/or if our attempts to eliminate mining and processing constraints are not successful, each of those events could have a material adverse impact on our potential future output, results of operations and profitability.\nWe currently depend on a single mine and there is no assurance that we will not incur any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Hycroft Mine is our only mining property. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in profitably operating the Hycroft Mine using the oxide leach process, the proprietary two-stage heap oxidization and leach process for sulfide ore, or alternative processing technologies. Further, any interruption in our ability to operate the Hycroft Mine, such as, but not limited to, a pandemic, natural disaster, loss of material permits, extended supply interruptions, processing interruptions or difficulties or labor strike would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce gold and silver and to generate revenue and liquidity.\nWe cannot be certain that our future development activities will be commercially successful.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to construct and operate the Hycroft Mine including additional equipment and infrastructure such as additional leach pads to extract gold and silver from our sulfide ore utilizing the new metallurgical processes described in the Hycroft Technical Report, to further develop our Hycroft Mine to identify new mineral reserves and mineral resources, and to expand or establish mineral reserves and mineral resources through drilling and analysis. We cannot provide assurance that our process to extract gold and silver from sulfide ore using a proprietary two-stage heap oxidation and leach process can be maintained on an economic and profitable basis, that any mineral reserves or mineral resources discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely or economic basis. A number of factors, including costs, actual mineralization, consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity and reagent quantities and prices affect successful project development. The efficient operation of processing facilities, the existence of competent operational management, as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development. We can provide no assurance that the development and advancement of the Hycroft Mine sulfide leaching operations will result in economically viable mining operations or yield new mineral reserves or resources.\nOur reliance on third party contractors and consultants to conduct our operations and construction projects exposes us to risks.\nIn connection with the operation of the Hycroft Mine, we contract and engage third party contractors and consultants to assist with aspects of our operations and related construction projects, including construction of new leach pads, maintenance, repair and improvements to our crushing and processing facilities, and mining of our ore and waste. As a result, our operations and construction projects are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022negotiating agreements with contractors and consultants on acceptable terms;\n\u2022the inability to replace a contractor or consultant and their operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u2022reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor or consultant;\n\u2022failure of a contractor or consultant to perform under their agreement or disputes relative to their performance;\n\u2022interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor or consultant ceases their business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u2022failure of a contractor or consultant to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent they are responsible for such compliance; and\n\u2022problems of a contractor or consultant with managing their workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors or consultants. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could decrease our gold and silver production, increase our costs, interrupt or delay our mining operations or our ability to access our ores, and adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nA shortage of equipment and supplies and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at our Hycroft Mine could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various supplies and equipment to engage in mining and development operations. The shortage of such supplies, equipment and parts and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at our Hycroft Mine could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and develop the Hycroft Mine, and therefore limit or increase the cost of production. Such shortages could also result in increased construction costs and cause delays in expansion projects.\nThe inability to obtain soda ash or delays in obtaining soda ash could adversely affect our ability to profitably operate our business.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers that produce and supply soda ash and to our knowledge, such suppliers do not typically mine soda ash in excess of what they believe they can sell. We entered into a three-year agreement with a soda ash supplier in April 2019 to provide soda ash for our operations. However, if the contracted supplier cancels the contract, is unable to produce and supply enough soda ash or ceases operations because of the large quantities of soda ash required in our operations, we may have to temporarily stop mining until we can obtain a new contract to purchase soda ash. Further, we cannot provide any assurance as to the costs that we might incur in obtaining soda ash from a substitute supplier which could materially and adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our mining operations.\nChanges in the cost or supply of energy or commodities used in operations may adversely affect the profitability of our operations and our financial condition.\nOur mining operation requires significant quantities of energy. Our principal energy sources are electricity and diesel fuel. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in our mining activities. Energy prices can be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including global and regional supply and demand, political and economic conditions, and applicable regulatory regimes. The prices of various sources of energy may increase significantly from current levels. An increase in energy prices could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to produce gold and silver or delay any expansion projects or plans. Our mining operation is in a remote location requiring the long-distance transmission of power. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations or expansion projects.\nOur production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we consume or use in our operations, such as diesel fuel, sodium cyanide, soda ash, lime, tires, and explosives. The prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control. Increases in the price for materials consumed in our mining and production activities could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by challenges relating to slope stability.\nOur open pit mine gets deeper and creates a larger footprint as we mine it, presenting certain geotechnical challenges including the possibility of slope failure. If we are required to decrease pit slope angles or provide additional road access to prevent such a failure, our stated mineral reserves could be negatively affected. Further, hydrological conditions relating to pit slopes, removal of material displaced by slope failures and increased stripping requirements could also negatively affect our stated mineral reserves. We cannot provide any assurances that we will not have to take additional action to maintain slope stability in the future or that our actions taken to date will be sufficient. Unexpected failure or additional requirements to prevent slope failure may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, as well as have the effect of diminishing our stated mineral reserves.\nThe Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries. These restrictions will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, as applicable:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other restricted payments, including certain investments;\n\u2022create or permit certain liens;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities.\nIn addition, the Sprott Credit Agreement will require us to comply with a number of customary covenants, including:\n\u2022covenants related to the delivery of monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements, budgets and annual projections;\n\u2022maintaining required insurance;\n\u2022compliance with laws (including environmental);\n\u2022compliance with ERISA;\n\u2022maintenance of ownership of 100% of Hycroft Mine;\n\u2022restrictions on consolidations, mergers or sales of assets;\n\u2022limitations on liens;\n\u2022limitations on issuance of certain equity interests;\n\u2022limitations on issuance of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022limitations on transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022other customary covenants.\nWe cannot assure you that we will satisfy these covenants or that our lenders will waive any future failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants under the Sprott Credit Agreement could result in a default. See Note 9 - Debt, Net to the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information. If a default occurs under the Sprott Credit Agreement and/or the Royalty Agreement among Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC and Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO) Inc., (\u201cSprott Royalty Agreement\u201d), the lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which, in the case of the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement, constitutes all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had substantial outstanding indebtedness under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. Subject to the limits and terms contained in the Sprott Credit Agreement, if we are able to incur additional debt or grant additional security interests from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes, then the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Our high level of debt and royalty payment obligations could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022require a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service and/or royalty payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to commodity price volatility, including increases in prices of commodities that we purchase and decreases in prices of gold and silver that we sell, each as part of our operations, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt, and the price of our common stock. The Sprott Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of nearly all of our debt.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay any of our indebtedness or otherwise default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, lenders could accelerate such debt and we may be subject to restrictions on the payment of our other debt obligations or cause a cross-acceleration.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of such indebtedness, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on other debt instruments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and royalty payment obligations, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in any agreement governing our indebtedness, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness and other indebtedness under the cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions of such agreements. In the event of such default:\n\u2022the lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to terminate any commitments thereunder, declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable and, if not promptly paid, in the case of our secured debt, institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022even if these lenders or holders do not declare a default, they may be able to cause all of our available cash to be used to repay indebtedness owed to them.\nAs a result of such default and any actions the lenders may take in response thereto, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and royalty obligations or refinance our debt obligations (if necessary) depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold and silver. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and our royalty obligations.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our royalty obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Sprott Credit Agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service and royalty payment obligations then due.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which in the future may not be guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt and royalty obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur lack of exploration activities will lead to our inability to replace depleted mineral reserves.\nTo maintain production levels over time we must replace depleted reserves by exploiting known ore bodies and locating new deposits. We have plans to continue exploration related to the mining and processing of gold and silver contained in ore within the Hycroft Mine, which may include areas surrounding the Hycroft Mine operating properties. There can be no assurance that such projects will be successful. Our mineral base will decline if reserves are mined without adequate replacement, and we may not be able to sustain production beyond the currently contemplated mine life, based on projected production rates. As a result, our revenues from the future sale of gold and silver may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. Further, we expect to encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing gold and silver. If or when we attempt to acquire new properties, we will face competition from many of these companies that have greater financial resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand current mineral reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable.\nLand reclamation requirements for the Hycroft Mine may be burdensome and expensive and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those requirements.\nLand reclamation requirements are generally imposed on companies with mining operations in order to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents, treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards, and reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance landforms and vegetation.\nIn order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our activities, we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further development programs. We have established a provision for our reclamation obligations on the Hycroft Mine property, as appropriate, but this provision may not be adequate. If we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected.\nWe are also required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved reclamation plans for the Hycroft Mine if we are unable to do so. Third party financial assurances may not be available to us or we may elect not to obtain it because of the high costs, associated collateral requirements may be too expensive or it may be commercially impractical which could adversely affect our financial position.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to develop our business.\nOur development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees, specifically, Diane Garrett, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Stanton Rideout, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John (Jack) Henris, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and other key employees that we may hire in the future. We will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons, our development and growth could be significantly curtailed.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems that are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, extortion to prevent or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, extortion, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe three largest stockholders of the Company are able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Mudrick Capital Management LP, (\u201cMudrick Capital\u201d), Whitebox Advisors LLC (\u201cWhitebox\u201d), and Highbridge Capital Management LLC, (\u201cHighbridge\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 42%, 20% and 13% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, respectively. Because of their significant stockholdings, each of Mudrick Capital, Whitebox and Highbridge could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise influence our business. This influence could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or entrenching management or the Board of Directors, which could conflict with the interests of other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of our shares of common stock and publicly traded warrants may fluctuate widely.\nThe trading price of our common stock and warrants listed for trading may fluctuate substantially and may be lower than current price. This may be especially true for companies like ours with a small public float. If an active market for our securities continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The trading price of our common stock and warrants depends on many factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock and/or warrants. Any of the factors listed below could have an adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to the Company;\n\u2022changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022the operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the market in general;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022the volume of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022any major change in the Board of Directors or management;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, \u201ctrade wars,\u201d reductions in precious metals prices, increases in fuel and other commodity prices used in the operation of our business, currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq Capital Market have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. Broad market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may seriously affect the market price of our common stock and warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock shortly following the business combination. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigations have often been instituted against these companies. Litigation of this type, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nThere is no guarantee that our outstanding public warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of warrants may be amended.\nWe have 34,289,898 publicly traded warrants outstanding that entitle holders to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share for a period of five years from the May 29, 2020 Recapitalization Transaction. On October 6, 2020, we issued 9,583,334 units in an underwritten public offering at an offering price to of $9.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.50 per share.\nAdditionally, as part of the Recapitalization Transaction, we assumed the obligations and liabilities under that certain warrant agreement, dated as of October 22, 2015, by and between Seller and Computershare Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a federally chartered trust company, collectively as initial warrant agent; and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC was named as the successor warrant agent (the \u201cSeller Warrant Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the assumption of the Seller Warrant Agreement, the warrants issued thereunder (the \u201cSeller Warrants\u201d) became exercisable into shares of our common stock. As of March 22, 2020, the exercise price for the Seller Warrants was $40.31 per share of our common stock.\nThere is no guarantee that any or all of the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make it more difficult to remove management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies our Board of Directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members our Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, the directors and officers; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and a \"smaller reporting company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as such may make our common stock less attractive to our stockholders.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of\u2009 (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 12, 2023, the fifth anniversary of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the Company\u2019s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $250 million or more measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements. Our stockholders may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and our reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements afforded to these companies.", "PERMNO": 91976, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "HYMC"}
