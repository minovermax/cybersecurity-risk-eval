Risk Factors\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and our overall financial performance. In addition to the matters discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the more significant of such risks and uncertainties include the following:\nWe have not realized an operating profit in fifteen years and there is no guarantee that we will realize an operating profit in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $226.4 million. We expect to continue to use cash and incur operating expenses to support our growth, including costs associated with recruiting, training, and managing our sales force, costs to develop and acquire new technology, and promotional costs associated with reaching new clients. These investments, which typically are made in advance of revenue, may not yield an offsetting increase in revenue. As a result of these factors, our future revenue and income potential is uncertain.\nOur financial results are subject to significant fluctuations because of many factors, any of which could adversely affect our stock price.\nIt is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our publicly-traded securities may fall. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are not in our control. We may incur an impairment of goodwill if our financial results are adversely impacted by these factors and we continue to incur financial losses or our stock price declines. These factors include:\n\u2022\nOur ability to continue to grow our revenue and meet anticipated growth targets;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain our current relationships, and develop new relationships, with clients, service providers, and business partners;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated cancellations or deferrals of, or reductions in the scope of, major Behavioral Analytics contracts;\n\u2022\nThe length of the sales cycle associated with our solutions;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully introduce new, and upgrade our existing, service offerings for clients; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to respond effectively to competition.\nIf we are unable to address these risks, our business, results of operations, and prospects could suffer.\nWe depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of a significant client or a substantial decline in the size or scope of deployments for a significant client, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future, a significant portion of our total revenue from a limited number of clients. See \u201cClients\u201d in Part I Item 1 and \u201cYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2013\u201d included in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent that any significant client uses less of our services or terminates its relationship with us, as may occur as clients respond to conditions affecting their own businesses, our total revenue could decline substantially and that could significantly harm our business. In addition, because a high percentage of our revenue is dependent on a relatively small number of clients, delayed payments by a few of our larger clients could result in a reduction of our available cash, which in turn may cause fluctuation in our Days Sales Outstanding (\u201cDSO\u201d).\nWe depend on good relations with our major clients, and any harm to these good relations may materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to compete effectively.\nTo attract and retain clients, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality analytics and related services. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be damaging to our reputation and business. Any defects or errors in our services or solutions or failure to meet our clients\u2019 expectations could result in:\n\u2022\nDelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\nObligations to provide additional services to a client at a reduced fee or at no charge;\n\u2022\nNegative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients; and\n\u2022\nClaims for damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure.\nIf we fail to meet our contractual obligations with our clients, then we could be subject to legal liability or loss of clients. Although our contracts include provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims related to the services and solutions we provide, these provisions may not protect us, or protect us sufficiently, in all cases.\nWe must maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition to remain competitive.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation and brand name is critical for attracting and expanding our targeted client base. This is particularly the case given that we relaunched our business under a new brand name in June 2011. We continue to invest substantially in marketing in order to make our new name known in the marketplace for our services and solutions. If potential clients do not know what solutions we provide, or if our reputation is damaged, then we may become less competitive or lose our market share. Promotion and enhancement of our name and brand will depend largely on both the efficacy of our relatively nascent marketing efforts and our success in providing high quality services, software, and solutions, neither of which can be assured.\nOur clients use our solutions for critical applications. If clients do not perceive our solutions to be effective or of higher quality than those available from our competitors, or if our solutions result in errors, defects, or other performance problems, then our brand name and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur industry is very competitive and, if we fail to compete successfully, our market share and business will be adversely affected.\nAlthough we view the manner in which we provide Behavioral Analytics, and its benefits, to be unique, nonetheless we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing market and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services that may be viewed as similar to ours. These competitive organizations include data analytics solutions providers, voice recording and voice analytic service providers and software licensors, call routing solution providers, and strategic consulting firms. We compete with these organizations on factors such as expertise, price, and capacity.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, more clients, longer relationships with their clients, greater brand or name recognition, more registered patents, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and public relations resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be in a better position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements. They may also develop and promote their products and services more effectively than we do. New market entrants also pose a threat to our business. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer solutions that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price.\nWe must keep pace with the rapid rate of innovation in our industry in order to build our business.\nThe data analytics market, and particularly behavioral analytics, is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Our future business depends in part upon continued growth in the acceptance and use of Behavioral Analytics by our current and prospective clients. Their acceptance and usage in turn may depend upon factors such as: the actual or perceived benefits of adoption of Behavioral Analytics and related methodologies and technologies, including the predictability of a meaningful return on investment, cost efficiencies, or other measurable economic benefits; the actual or perceived reliability, scalability, ease of use, and access to such new technologies and methodologies; and the willingness to adopt new business methods. Furthermore, our future growth depends on our continuing ability to innovate in the field of data analytics and to incorporate emerging industry standards.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in anticipating or responding to these challenges on a timely or competitive basis or at all, or that our ideas and solutions will be successful in the marketplace. In addition, new or disruptive technologies and methodologies by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive. Any of these circumstances could significantly harm our business and financial results.\nBecause our services and solutions are sophisticated, we must devote significant time and effort to our sales and installation processes, with significant risk of loss if we are not successful.\nBecause our services and solutions are not simple, mass-market items with which our potential clients are already familiar, it is necessary for us to devote significant time and effort to the process of educating our potential clients about the benefits and value of our services and solutions as part of the sales process. In addition, because our services and solutions are sophisticated and in most cases are not readily usable by clients without our assistance in integration and configuration, training, and analysis, we must devote significant time during the installation and ongoing analysis process in order for our services and solutions to be successfully deployed. These efforts during both the sales and installation processes increase the time and difficulty of completing transactions, make it more difficult to efficiently deploy our limited resources, and create risk that we will have invested in an opportunity that ultimately does not come to fruition. If we are unable to demonstrate the benefits and value of our services and solutions to clients and efficiently convert our sales leads into successful sales and installations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe unauthorized disclosure of the confidential customer data that we maintain could result in a significant loss of business and subject us to substantial liability.\nIn providing Behavioral Analytics, we record and analyze telephone calls and other interactions between our clients\u2019 call center and back office agents and their customers. These interactions may contain numerous references to highly sensitive confidential or personally-identifiable data of the customers of our clients, and many of our clients are required to comply with Federal and state laws concerning privacy and security, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. In addition, we have made certain contractual commitments to our clients regarding this confidential data.\nParticularly with regard to clients in highly-regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services, many of our clients demand that we agree not to limit our liability in the event of a security breach resulting in the loss of, or unauthorized access to, personally-identifiable data. As a result, the disclosure or loss of such data despite the extensive precautions we undertake could result in the considerable diminution of our business and prospects and could subject us to substantial liability.\nIn addition, the laws, regulations, and industry standards governing these matters are changing rapidly. It is possible that the resources we devote to comply with such laws, regulations, and industry standards, and our clients\u2019 particular requirements, could increase materially. In our contracts, we generally agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential data. These indemnity obligations are generally not subject to contractual limitations on liability. As a result, the amount of liability we could incur in connection with these indemnity obligations could exceed the revenue we receive from the client under the applicable contract.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients\u2019 businesses and levels of business activity.\nEconomic and political conditions in the U.S. affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients\u2019 financial conditions and the levels of business activity of our clients and the industries we serve. This may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in U.S. economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, these economic conditions may cause our clients to delay payments for services we have provided to them, resulting in a negative impact to our cash flow. If we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, then we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe rely heavily on our senior management team for the success of our business.\nGiven the highly specialized nature of our services, senior management must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage the organization. If one or more members of our senior management team leaves and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly, then we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly, and this could harm our business prospects, client relationships, employee morale, and results of operations. We recently announced that our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Iserloth, is resigning effective March 13, 2015. While his responsibilities are being assumed by our Executive Vice President of Product and Customer Operations, this change could be disruptive to our operations.\nOur ability to recruit talented professionals and retain our existing professionals is critical to the success of our business.\nWe believe that our success depends substantially on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain highly skilled management, strategic, technical, product development, data analysis, and other key professional employees. Our business straddles the information-technology and data analytics services industries, which are people-intensive and face shortages of qualified personnel, especially those with specialized skills or experience. We compete with other companies to recruit and hire from this limited pool, particularly in Austin, Texas, the location of our research and development team and in Chicago, Illinois, the location of our data science and analytics teams.\nIf we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, or if a significant number of our current employees should leave, and we have difficulty replacing such persons, then we could potentially suffer the loss of client relationships or new business opportunities and our business could be seriously harmed. In addition, there is no guarantee that the employee and client non-solicitation and non-competition agreements we have entered into with our senior professionals would deter them from departing us for our competitors or that such agreements would be upheld and enforced by a court or other arbiter across all jurisdictions where we engage in business.\nWe have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success and competitive position.\nOur ability to protect our software, algorithms, databases, methodologies, and other intellectual property is important to our success and our competitive position. We view as proprietary the software (including source code), algorithms, databases, analysis, and other ideas, concepts, and developments that we create in order to provide, improve, and enhance our service offerings, as well as the work product we create in the course of providing services for clients. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights in these developments and work product by applying for patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as appropriate, as well as by enforcing applicable trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on scope of use, disclosure, copying, reverse engineering, and assignment.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, others may attempt to disclose, obtain, or use our rights. The steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may not detect unauthorized use of, or take timely and effective actions to enforce and protect, our intellectual property rights.\nWe may be required to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market, and deliver current and new services and solutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that rights granted by these licenses ultimately will be valid and enforceable.\nOthers could claim that our services, products, or solutions infringe upon their intellectual property rights or violate contractual protections.\nWe or our clients may be subject to claims that our services, products, or solutions, or the products of our software providers or other alliance partners, infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Any such infringement claims may result in substantial costs, divert management attention and other resources, harm our reputation, and prevent us from offering some services, products, or solutions. A successful infringement claim against us could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringement by our services, products, or solutions, in most cases excluding third-party components, of the intellectual property rights of others. In some instances, the amount of these indemnity obligations may be greater than the revenue we receive from the client under the applicable contract. In addition, we may develop work product in connection with specific projects for our clients. Although our contracts with our clients generally provide that we retain the ownership rights to our work product, it is possible that clients may assert rights to, and seek to limit our ability to resell or reuse, our work product. Furthermore, in some cases we assign to clients the copyright and, at times, other intellectual property rights, in and to some aspects of the software, documentation, or other work product developed for these clients in connection with these projects, which limits our ability to resell or reuse this intellectual property.\nIncreasing government regulation could cause us to lose clients or impair our business.\nWe are subject not only to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, but we are also subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our service offerings, including, but not limited to, those related to data privacy and security, electronic commerce, and call recording. Laws and regulations enacted in the U.S., both at the state and Federal level, as well as significant new rules issued with respect thereto, impose substantial requirements relating to the privacy and security of personal data, as well as the reporting of breaches with respect to personal data. Legislation that may be enacted in the future may add further requirements in these and other areas. In addition, we may be affected indirectly by legislation that impacts our existing and prospective clients, who may pass along to us by contract their legal obligations in these and other areas. Any such laws and regulations therefore could affect our existing business relationships or prevent us from obtaining new clients.\nIt may be difficult for us to access debt or equity markets to meet our financial needs.\nIn the event, for any reason, we need to raise additional funds in the future, through public or private debt or equity financings, such funds may not be available or may not be available on terms favorable to us. The failure by us to obtain such financing, if needed, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87602, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "MATR"}
