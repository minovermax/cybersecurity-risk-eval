RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, the global economic climate and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may amplify many of the risks described below or their impact on us.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur ability to execute on our business strategy is subject to a number of risks, which are discussed more fully below in this section. You should carefully consider these risks before making an investment in our common stock. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u25cf Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could materially and adversely affect our preclinical and clinical trials, business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations;\n\u25cf We will need to raise additional capital to support our operations;\n\u25cf We have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and our future profitability is uncertain;\n\u25cf We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable;\n\u25cf Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members;\n\u25cf If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired and our public reporting may be unreliable;\n\u25cf If we fail to develop and maintain proper and effective processes and operating procedures as a non-traditional government contractor, our ability to adhere to the DoD and related entity standards could impact our ongoing and future development financing awards from the U.S. government;\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain FDA approval of our products, we will not be able to commercialize our products in the United States;\n\u25cf Results from preclinical studies and Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials of our product candidates or from single-patient expanded access treatments may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials;\n\u25cf We are seeking to develop antibacterial agents using bacteriophage and synthetic phage technology, a novel approach, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development. No bacteriophage products have been approved in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf Delays in our clinical trials could result in us not achieving anticipated developmental milestones when expected, increased costs and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf We have not completed formulation development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf Our product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, such clinical testing may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy and any of our product candidates could cause undesirable side effects, which would substantially delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization;\n\u25cf We must continue to develop manufacturing processes for our product candidates and any delay in or our inability to do so would result in delays in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf We may conduct clinical trials for our products or product candidates outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from such trials;\n\u25cf We are subject to significant regulatory approval requirements, which could delay, prevent or limit our ability to market our product candidates;\n\u25cf Failure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business;\n\u25cf A variety of risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf We may face risks associated with build activities related to the lease agreement entered into during 2021 for future research and manufacturing needs;\n\u25cf We depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time and we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order to obtain financing, pursue collaborations or develop and market our product candidates;\n\u25cf We must manage a geographically dispersed organization;\n\u25cf We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf We are dependent on patents, trade secrets and other forms of non-patent intellectual property protection. If we fail to adequately protect this intellectual property or if we otherwise do not have exclusivity for the marketing of our products, our ability to commercialize products could suffer;\n\u25cf If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or if we are forced to engage in an interference proceeding, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation or interference would have a material adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more affordable than ours, or obtain marketing approval before we do, our commercial opportunities may be limited;\n\u25cf There is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we do not obtain sufficient liability insurance, a product liability claim could result in substantial liabilities;\n\u25cf Even if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability;\n\u25cf The uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf Innoviva may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support;\n\u25cf The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile; and\n\u25cf We have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could materially and adversely affect our preclinical and clinical trials, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impinge upon the U.S. and global economies and has directly and indirectly impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition and is expected to continue to impact our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays in our clinical trials due to the implementation of COVID-19 protocols at investigator sites, which resulted in longer than anticipated site identification and initiation activities. In addition, while we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our supply chain, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing response efforts may have a future impact on our third-party suppliers and partners and the conduct of future clinical trials. It is possible that due to the continued development and manufacturing of vaccines for COVID-19, certain basic supply chain materials such as resins, vessels, vials and stoppers may be in high demand by the pharmaceutical companies developing and manufacturing vaccines and our ability to obtain these materials for our development activities could be negatively impacted. Although we have experienced some delays of this nature in 2021, such delays have not had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the operations of the FDA and other health authorities, resulting in delays of reviews and approvals with respect to our product candidates. While the full scope of the economic impact brought by, and the ultimate duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to assess or predict, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. In addition, the loss of any of our employees as a result of COVID-19 (including as a result of vaccine mandates), or another pandemic, may adversely affect our operations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain, and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts that COVID-19 may have on our business, financing or clinical trial activities.\nSome examples of potential disruptions that have resulted or may result from COVID-19 include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays or difficulties in initiating or expanding clinical trials, including delays or difficulties with clinical site initiation and recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf\nincreased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19 or other health conditions or being forced to quarantine;\n\u25cf\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring and efficacy, safety and translational data collection, processing and analyses, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state or local governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits, which may impact the collection and integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays or disruptions in preclinical experiments and IND-enabling studies due to restrictions of on-site staff and unforeseen circumstances at contract research organizations, or CROs, and vendors;\n\u25cf\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agency;\n\u25cf\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u25cf\ndelays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on employee or other resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials and pre-clinical work, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid travel or contact with large groups of people, an increased reliance on working from home, school closures or mass transit disruptions or a refusal to comply with vaccine mandates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf\ndelays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government or contractor personnel; and\n\u25cf\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agency;\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic remains volatile. The extent to which the pandemic may affect our clinical trials, business, financial condition and results of operations remains dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the evolution and spread of COVID-19 variants, such as the Delta variant, the ultimate duration of the pandemic, business closures or business disruptions, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and compliance with vaccine mandates. Future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our clinical trials, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may affect our ability to obtain future financing and may require us to curtail our operations. We will need to raise additional capital to support our operations.\nThe audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included disclosures and an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm stating that our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.3 million, and we have had recurring losses from operations and negative operating cash flows since inception.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to support our operations and product development activities. In the near term, we expect to continue to fund our operations, if at all, primarily through equity and debt financings. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions, including the current recession, and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We may also seek funds through arrangements with collaborators, grant agencies or others that may require us to relinquish rights to the product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. If we are unable to secure additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or other operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders, enter into arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates, technologies or potential markets, file for bankruptcy or cease\noperations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, we completed a private placement (\u201c2020 Private Placement\u201d) transaction in which we sold to Innoviva a total of 8,710,800 newly issued shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and warrants to purchase 8,710,800 shares of common stock, with an exercise price per share of $2.87. The 2020 Private Placement was closed in two tranches for total aggregate gross proceeds of $25.0 million.\nOn January 26, 2021, we entered into the 2021 Securities Purchase Agreement in connection with the 2021 Private Placement. See the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Recent Developments\u201d for a description of the 2021 Private Placement.\nOn October 28, 2021, we completed a private placement (the \u201cOctober 2021 Private Placement\u201d) transaction in which we sold to CFF and Innoviva Strategic Opportunities LLC, a total of 2,121,213 shares of our newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $7.0 million, before deducting transaction expenses.\nOn February 9, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement to sell our common stock and warrants to Innoviva (\u201cFebruary 2022 Private Placement\u201d). The gross proceeds from the transaction are expected to be $45 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses. Pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the securities purchase agreement and related agreements, Innoviva will purchase 9,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock, at a price of $5.00 per share, and warrants to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The stock purchases are expected to occur in two tranches. Upon execution, Innoviva purchased 3,614,792 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,807,396 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.1 million. At the closing of the second tranche, upon our stockholders voting in favor of the transaction, Innoviva will purchase 5,385,208 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 2,692,604 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $26.9 million. Subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the approval of our stockholders, the second closing contemplated by the securities purchase agreement is expected to occur near the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nWhile we believe that our existing resources and expected proceeds from the second tranche of the February 2022 Private Placement will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2023, we cannot provide assurances that our estimates are accurate, that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Developing drugs and conducting clinical trials is expensive. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the costs and timing of our research and development activities;\n\u25cf the progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u25cf manufacturing costs associated with our targeted phage therapies strategy and other research and development activities;\n\u25cf the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf whether and when we receive future Australian tax rebates, if any;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf the costs of lawsuits involving us or our product candidates.\nIn addition, raising additional capital through the sale of securities could cause significant dilution to our stockholders. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day to day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success of our product development activities, including our targeted phage therapies strategy and any clinical trials we initiate, regulatory events, our ability to identify and enter into in-licensing or other strategic arrangements, and other events or conditions that may affect our value or prospects, as well as factors related to financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurances that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was $202.9 million and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have devoted, and will continue to devote for the foreseeable future, substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had losses from operations of $23.8 million and $21.6 million, respectively. Additional information regarding our results of operations may be found in our consolidated financial statements and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Item 2 in this report.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nClinical trials and activities associated with discovery research are costly. We do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term, and we expect to continue to have significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to generate meaningful revenue and achieve profitability depends on successfully completing the development of, and obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to, commercialize our product candidates. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or if any of our product candidates do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u25cf completing research and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u25cf developing a sustainable, scalable, reproducible, and transferable manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u25cf launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either by establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure, or by collaborating with a partner;\n\u25cf obtaining market acceptance of any approved products;\n\u25cf addressing any competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure, as needed;\n\u25cf identifying and validating new product candidates;\n\u25cf negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u25cf maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u25cf attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), or other foreign regulatory authorities to perform clinical trials and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules of the NYSE American. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently.\nWe currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud.\nIn accordance with NYSE American rules, we are required to maintain a majority independent board of directors. The various rules and regulations applicable to public companies make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors will be significantly curtailed.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired and our public reporting may be unreliable.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Material weaknesses in\nour internal controls have been identified in the past, and we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective controls and procedures, or identify any future material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports and we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain proper and effective processes and operating procedures as a non-traditional government contractor, our ability to adhere to the Department of Defense and related entity standards could impact our ongoing and future development financing awards from the U.S. government.\nOn June 15, 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (\u201cMTEC Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which we have started to receive a $15 million grant and have entered into a three-year program administered by the DoD through MTEC with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. We plan to use the grant to partially fund a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical study of Armata's therapeutic phage-based candidate, AP-SA02, for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia infections.\nAs an organization, we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails. If we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and may result in the termination of our government contracts, including the MTEC Agreement.\nGovernment contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u25cf tracking of contract costs and maintenance of effective controls over tracking of such costs;\n\u25cf completion and submission of periodic reporting packages;\n\u25cf mandatory financial audits and potential liability for failing such audits; and\n\u25cf mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs, and environmental compliance requirements.\nWhile we believe we are in compliance with all requirements under the MTEC Agreement, potential failure to maintain such compliance could result in reduction of the grant or termination of the contract, which could in turn negatively impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited operating history, have incurred significant operating losses since inception and expects to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nTo date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placement offerings of equity securities. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.3 million. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our development programs for our product candidates.\nWe currently generate no revenue from product sales, and may never be able to commercialize our product candidates, or other future product candidates. We do not currently have the required approvals to market our product candidates and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any of our future development\npartners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when it will become profitable, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain FDA approval of our products, we will not be able to commercialize our products in the United States.\nWe need FDA approval prior to marketing our product candidates in the United States. If we fail to obtain FDA approval to market our product candidates, we will be unable to sell our products in the United States, which will significantly impair our ability to generate any revenues.\nThis regulatory review and approval process, which includes evaluation of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates as well as the evaluation of our manufacturing processes, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. To receive approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. Satisfaction of the approval requirements typically takes several years and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product. We do not know if or when we might receive regulatory approvals, including approval for an Investigational New Drug application (\u201cIND application\u201d), for any of our product candidates currently under development, other than for our product candidate AP-PA02, for which we received FDA clearance of our IND application. Moreover, approvals that we obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval, or could contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use. In such event, our ability to generate revenues from such products would be greatly reduced and our business would be harmed.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to consider any of our applications for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of our data that one or more of our applications are insufficient to approve if we our product candidates. If the FDA does not consider or approve any of our applications, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, pre-clinical or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before it will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other studies, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be successful or considered sufficient by the FDA for approval or even to make our applications approvable. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon one or more of our applications for approval, which might significantly harm our business and prospects.\nIt is possible that none of our products or any product we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence product sales. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our products, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability.\nResults from preclinical studies and Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials of our product candidates or from single-patient expanded access treatments may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials.\nPreclinical studies, including studies of our product candidates in animal disease models, may not accurately predict the result of human clinical trials of those product candidates. In particular, promising animal studies suggesting the efficacy of prototype phage products in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, may not predict the ability of these products to treat similar infections in humans. Despite promising data in our completed Phase 1 clinical trials, our phage technology may be found not to be safe or efficacious in treating bacterial infections alone or in combination with other agents, when studied in later-stage clinical trials.\nIn addition, we have used our bacteriophage technology in the area of targeted medicine under single-patient expanded access guidelines, which permit the use of phage therapy outside of clinical trials, in the United States and Australia. Despite prior single-patient expanded access successes, no assurance can be given that we will have similar\nsingle-patient expanded access treatment successes in the future. Single-patient expanded access is a term that is used to refer to the use of an investigational drug or therapy outside of a clinical trial to treat a patient with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition who has no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. Regulators often allow single-patient expanded access on a case-by-case basis for an individual patient or for defined groups of patients with similar treatment needs. In some countries, such as Australia, the treating physician can administer treatment under single-patient expanded access guidelines without pre-approval from the applicable regulatory authority.\nTo satisfy FDA or foreign regulatory approval standards for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate in adequate and controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Success in early clinical trials, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, or in our single-patient expanded access program does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Our initial results from early stage clinical trials or our single-patient expanded access program also may not be confirmed by later analysis or subsequent larger clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials and most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved for commercial sale.\nWe are seeking to develop antibacterial agents using bacteriophage and synthetic phage technology, a novel approach, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development. No bacteriophage products have been approved in the United States or elsewhere.\nWe are developing our product candidates with bacteriophage and synthetic phage technology. We have not, nor to our knowledge has any other company, received regulatory approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign agencies for a pharmaceutical drug based on this approach. While in vitro studies have characterized the behavior of bacteriophages in cell cultures and there exists a body of literature regarding the use of phage therapy in humans, the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in humans has not been extensively studied in well-controlled modern clinical trials. Most of the prior research on phage-based therapy was conducted in the former Soviet Union prior to and immediately after World War II and lacked appropriate control group design or lacked control groups at all. Furthermore, the standard of care has changed substantially during the ensuing decades since those studies were performed, diminishing the relevance of prior claims of improved cure rates. We cannot be certain that our approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable drugs.\nDeveloping phage-based therapies on a commercial scale will also require developing new manufacturing processes and techniques. We and our third-party collaborators may experience delays in developing manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates, and may not be able to do so at the scale required to efficiently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, or to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs based on these approaches, which could lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates.\nDelays in our clinical trials could result in us not achieving anticipated developmental milestones when expected, increased costs and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates.\nDelays in our ability to commence or enroll patients for our clinical trials could result in us not meeting anticipated clinical milestones and could materially impact our product development costs and delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Planned clinical trials may not be commenced or completed on schedule, or at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf delays in the development of manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates to enable their consistent production at clinical trial scale;\n\u25cf failures in our internal manufacturing operations that result in our inability to consistently and timely produce bacteriophages in sufficient quantities to support our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the availability of financial resources to commence and complete our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in reaching a consensus with clinical investigators on study design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on trial design or in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining clinical materials;\n\u25cf slower than expected patient recruitment for participation in clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure by clinical trial sites, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical trial agreements;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective sites or obtaining institutional review board approval;\n\u25cf changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether; and\n\u25cf adverse safety events experienced during our clinical trials.\nIf we do not successfully commence or complete our clinical trials on schedule, the price of our common stock may decline.\nCompletion of clinical trials depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients, which is a function of many factors, including:\n\u25cf the therapeutic endpoints chosen for evaluation;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf the perceived benefit of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf the size of the patient population required for analysis of the clinical trial\u2019s therapeutic endpoints;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators and sites with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials as a result of impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf competition for patients from clinical trials for other treatments.\nWe may experience difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials, which could increase the costs or affect the timing or outcome of these clinical trials. This is particularly true with respect to diseases with relatively small patient populations.\nWe have not completed formulation development of our product candidates.\nThe development of our bacteriophage product candidates requires that we isolate, select and combine a number of bacteriophages that target the desired bacteria for that product candidate. The selection of bacteriophages for any of our product candidates is based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the ability of the selected phages, in combination, to successfully kill the targeted bacteria, the degree of cross-reactivity of the individual phages with the same part of the bacterial targets, the ability of the combined phages to satisfy regulatory requirements, our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the phages, intellectual property rights of third parties, and other factors. While we have selected initial formulations of AP-SA02 for the treatment of S. aureus infections, and the initial formulations of AP-PA02 for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients. There can be no assurance that these initial formulations will be the final formulations of AP-SA02 or AP-PA02 for commercialization if approved. If we are unable to complete formulation development of our product candidates in the time frame that we have anticipated, then our product development timelines, and the regulatory approval of our product candidates, could be delayed.\nOur product candidates must undergo rigorous clinical testing, such clinical testing may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy and any of our product candidates could cause undesirable side effects, which would substantially delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials of new drug candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete.\nWe cannot be certain of successfully completing clinical testing within the time frame we have planned, or at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates, including the following:\n\u25cf our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing or to abandon programs;\n\u25cf the results obtained in earlier stage clinical testing may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials;\n\u25cf clinical trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf we, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u25cf our product candidates may have unintended or undesirable effects on patients that may delay or preclude regulatory approval of our product candidates or limit their commercial use, if approved.\nWe must continue to develop manufacturing processes for our product candidates and any delay in or our inability to do so would result in delays in our clinical trials.\nWe are developing novel manufacturing processes for our product candidates at our facility in Marina Del Rey (near Los Angeles), California. The manufacturing processes for our product candidates, and the scale-up of such processes for clinical trials, is novel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete this work in a timely manner, if at all. The manufacture of our product candidates requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up for commercial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the equipment and product candidates and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. If we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our products to patients in our clinical trials or to commercially launch a product would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption could postpone the\ncompletion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial program, and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the trials completely.\nAny delay in the development or scale up of these manufacturing processes could delay the start of clinical trials and harm our business. In the event our facility in Marina Del Rey does not receive a satisfactory cGMP inspection for the manufacture of our product candidates, we may need to fund additional modifications to our manufacturing process, conduct additional validation studies, or find alternative manufacturing facilities, any of which would result in significant cost to us as well as a delay of up to several years in obtaining approval for such product candidate.\nOur manufacturing facility will be subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP regulations. Compliance with these regulations and standards is complex and costly, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed (including fines, injunctions and civil penalties), failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nAny of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our products, entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Furthermore, if we fail to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis, pursuant to provided specifications and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and would lose potential revenues.\nWe may conduct clinical trials for our products or product candidates outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nWe completed an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of AP-SA01 at the University of Adelaide in Australia for CRS in December 2016. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the study must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, such studies would be subject to the applicable local laws and FDA acceptance of the data would be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. Further, with respect to AP-SA01, we have changed the product formulation to AP-SA02 and any work related to AP-SA01 may not be relevant to the FDA or other international regulatory authorities.\nWe may need to license additional intellectual property rights.\nThe development and commercialization of phage-based antibacterial agents may require us to obtain rights to intellectual property from third parties. We may also determine that it is necessary or advisable to license other intellectual property from third parties. There can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory approval requirements, which could delay, prevent or limit our ability to market our product candidates.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and the anticipated manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in Europe and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that our manufacturing facilities will satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. We require the approval of the relevant regulatory authorities before we may commence commercial sales of our product candidates in a given market. The regulatory approval process is expensive and time-consuming, and the timing of receipt of regulatory approval is\ndifficult to predict. Our product candidates could require a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than expected, or may never gain approval. We cannot be certain that, even after expending substantial time and financial resources, we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. A delay or denial of regulatory approval could delay or prevent our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve profitability.\nChanges in regulatory approval policies during the development period of any of our product candidates, changes in, or the enactment of, additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review practices for a submitted product application may cause a delay in obtaining approval or result in the rejection of an application for regulatory approval.\nRegulatory approval, if obtained, may be made subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market a product. These limitations could adversely affect our potential product revenues. Regulatory approval may also require costly post-marketing follow-up studies. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping related to the product will be subject to extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. Furthermore, for any marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, result in fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe and any potential collaborators may be subject to federal, state and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\u201cHITECH\u201d). Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nInternational data protection laws, including Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) may also apply to health-related and other personal information obtained outside of the United States. The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the European Union, as well as potential fines for non-compliant companies of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including more stringent requirements relating to consent and the information that must be shared with data subjects about how their personal information is used, the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches, extensive new internal privacy governance obligations and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfer. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Further, the United Kingdom\u2019s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nIn addition, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow\nfor a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA may impact (possibly significantly) our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.\nCompliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nA variety of risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we have operations and a subsidiary in Australia and a subsidiary company in the United Kingdom. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u25cf compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for the development, manufacture and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u25cf U.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u25cf changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u25cf challenges in enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks associated with build activities related to the lease agreement entered into during 2021 for future research and manufacturing needs\nOn October 28, 2021, we entered into a lease for office and research and development space under a non-cancellable lease in Los Angeles, CA (the \u201c2021 Lease\u201d). Under the 2021 Lease, together with the landlord, we are required to engage in significant construction activities prior to occupation of the leased premises, currently expected in 2022. While we are entitled to receive an allowance for tenant improvements of up to $7.3 million, we are required to expend our existing cash resources for construction costs in advance of the landlord reimbursing us for these costs and for all amounts above the agreed tenant improvement allowance. We are subject to potential construction delays and the resultant increased costs and risks, as well as uncertainties related to the contractors\u2019 ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs and timetables. If the contractors or developer fails to perform, we may modify the construction contract or resort to legal action to compel performance. A developer\u2019s or builder\u2019s performance may also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond that party\u2019s control, such as the supply chain delays. The landlord is also subject to uncertainties associated with obtaining permits for development, environmental and land use concerns of governmental entities. All the factors above could have a negative impact on our financial positions and development plans for our business. Moreover, as we rarely engage in construction activities, substantial renovation and construction activities could require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, diverting the attention of our management from other strategic matters.\nInnoviva, our principal shareholder, beneficially owns greater than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which will cause us to be deemed a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the rules of NYSE. In addition, Innoviva\u2019s interests in our business may be different than our other shareholders.\nUpon closing of both the first and second tranche of the February 2022 Private Placement, Innoviva expects to own approximately 70% of our outstanding shares and 19,364,647 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. If Innoviva were to exercise the warrants held by them, they would hold approximately 77.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. s a result, Innoviva owns more than 50% of our outstanding shares, and as such, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and, as such, may elect to be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe board of directors maintain a nominating and corporate governance comprised solely of independent directors and with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe board of director maintain a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors and with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we may elect to rely on some or all of these exemptions, however, we do not intend take advantage of any of these exemptions. Despite the fact we do not intend to take advantage of these exemptions, our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nWe depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time and we may need to hire additional qualified personnel in order to obtain financing, pursue collaborations or develop and market our product candidates\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, manufacturing, and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. Our success will depend on our ability to retain and motivate personnel\nand hire additional qualified personnel when required, including personnel with expertise in clinical trials, government regulation, cGMP manufacturing, and other areas. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. We face competition for personnel from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, public and private research institutions and other organizations. We also face competition from other more well-funded and well-established businesses, and we may also be viewed as a riskier choice from a job stability perspective due to our relative newer status than longer existing biotech and pharmaceutical companies. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and advisors, it may negatively affect our ability to successfully develop, test, commercialize and market our products and product candidates.\nWe must manage a geographically dispersed organization.\nWhile we are a small company, we currently have operations in the United States and Australia. In the future, we may also locate facilities in other locations based on proximity to personnel with the expertise needed to research, develop and manufacture phage-based therapeutics, costs of operations or other factors. Managing our organization across multiple locations and multiple time zones may reduce our efficiency, increase our expenses and increase the risk of operational difficulties in the execution of our plans.\nBecause the Merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code for Armata, Armata\u2019s pre-Merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations. The net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes of C3J may also be subject to limitations as a result of ownership changes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The Merger resulted in an ownership change for AmpliPhi and, accordingly, AmpliPhi\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to limitations (or disallowance) on their use after the Merger. C3J\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to limitation as a result of prior shifts in equity ownership and/or the Merger. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $127.7 million.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe use third parties, such as clinical research organizations, to assist in conducting our clinical trials. However, we may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion or if we are forced to change service providers. This risk is heightened for clinical trials conducted outside of the United States, where it may be more difficult to ensure that clinical trials are conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Any third party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials and in our plans to submit Biologics License Applications, the commercial prospects for product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented.\nOur clinical research operations could also be negatively impacted by delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are not able to predict the impact on the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials as a result of COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are dependent on patents and proprietary technology. If we fail to adequately protect this intellectual property or if we otherwise do not have exclusivity for the marketing of our products, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection sufficient to prevent others from marketing our product candidates, as well as to defend and enforce these patents against infringement and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Protection of our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties will depend on having valid and enforceable patents cover our product candidates or their manufacture or use, or having effective trade secret protection. If our patent applications do not result in issued patents, or if our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the inventions claimed therein. We have a limited number of patents and pending patent applications.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. This is due to inconsistent application of policy and changes in policy relating to examination and enforcement of biotechnology patents to date on a global scale. The laws of some countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of countries having well-established patent systems, and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. Also, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We are not able to guarantee that all of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents and we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed in our patent applications or in the patent applications we may license from others.\nCentral provisions of The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act went into effect on September 16, 2012 and on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are being filed, prosecuted and litigated. For example, the America Invents Act enacted proceedings involving post-issuance patent review procedures, such as inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d), and post-grant review, that allow third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cU.S. PTO\u201d) Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Each proceeding has different eligibility criteria and different patentability challenges that can be raised. IPRs permit any person (except a party who has been litigating the patent for more than a year) to challenge the validity of the patent on the grounds that it was anticipated or made obvious by prior art. Patents covering pharmaceutical products have been subject to attack in IPRs from generic drug companies and from hedge funds. If it is within six months of the issuance of the challenged patent, a third party can petition the U.S. PTO for post-grant review, which can be based on any invalidity grounds and is not limited to prior art patents or printed publications.\nIn post-issuance proceedings, U.S. PTO rules and regulations generally tend to favor patent challengers over patent owners. For example, unlike in district court litigation, claims challenged in post-issuance proceedings are given their broadest reasonable meaning, which increases the chance a claim might be invalidated by prior art or lack support in the patent specification. As another example, unlike in district court litigation, there is no presumption of validity for an issued patent, and thus, a challenger\u2019s burden to prove invalidity is by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to the heightened clear and convincing evidence standard. As a result of these rules and others, statistics released by the U.S. PTO show a high percentage of claims being invalidated in post-issuance proceedings. Moreover, with few exceptions, there is no standing requirement to petition the U.S. PTO for inter partes review or post-grant review. In other words, companies that have not been charged with infringement or that lack commercial interest in the patented subject matter can still petition the U.S. PTO for review of an issued patent. Thus, even where we have issued patents, our rights under those patents may be challenged and ultimately not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf we might not be the first to file patent applications for our inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative product candidates to any of our product candidates that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products that fall outside the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional patentable proprietary technologies related to our product candidates; and\n\u25cf we are dependent upon the diligence of our appointed agents in national jurisdictions, acting for and on our behalf, which control the prosecution of pending domestic and foreign patent applications and maintain granted domestic and foreign patents.\nAn issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing the same or related product candidates or could limit the length of the term of patent protection of our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Patent term extensions may not be available for these patents.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other forms of non-patent intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, other companies may be able to compete more effectively against us.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, including our proprietary processes for manufacturing and purifying bacteriophages. Trade secrets are difficult to protect, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, where much of the information about a product must be made public during the regulatory approval process. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secret information is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to or may not protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or if we are forced to engage in an interference proceeding, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation or interference would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of anti-infective products or in fields that otherwise may relate to our product candidates. If we are shown to infringe, we could be enjoined from use or sale of the claimed invention if we are unable to prove that the patent is invalid. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe, or which may trigger an interference proceeding regarding one of our owned or licensed patents or applications. There could also be existing patents of which\nwe are not aware that our product candidates may inadvertently infringe or which may become involved in an interference proceeding.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. For so long as our product candidates are in clinical trials, we believe our clinical activities fall within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our clinical investigational drug product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. While we attempt to ensure that our active clinical investigational drugs and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their use we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain they do not, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our product candidates, or the methods we employ to manufacture them, or the uses for which we intend to promote them, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Our ability to manufacture and commercialize our product candidates may depend on our ability to demonstrate that the manufacturing processes we employ and the use of our product candidates do not infringe third-party patents. If third-party patents were found to cover our product candidates or their use or manufacture, we could be required to pay damages or be enjoined and therefore unable to commercialize our product candidates, unless we obtained a license. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more affordable than ours, or obtain marketing approval before we do, our commercial opportunities may be limited.\nCompetition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and continues to increase. Some companies that are larger and have significantly more resources than we do are aggressively pursuing antibacterial development programs, including traditional therapies and therapies with novel mechanisms of action. In addition, other companies are developing phage-based products for non-therapeutic uses, and may elect to use their expertise in phage development and manufacturing to try to develop products that would compete with ours.\nWe also face potential competition from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions engaged in the discovery and development of drugs and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing, sales and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, have fewer side effects and are safer or more affordable than our product candidates, which would render our product candidates less competitive or noncompetitive. These competitors also compete with us to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel, establish clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as to acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Moreover, competitors that are able to achieve patent protection, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do, and competitors that have already done so, may enjoy a significant competitive advantage.\nThe Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products. These incentives may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics, and may cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts towards the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we do not obtain sufficient liability insurance, a product liability claim could result in substantial liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf delay or failure to complete our clinical trials;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf litigation costs;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards against us; and\n\u25cf diversion of management or other resources from key aspects of our operations.\nIf we succeed in marketing products, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs. An FDA investigation could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, or limitations on the indications, for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approval.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a $10.0 million annual per claim and aggregate limit. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates or any other compound that we may develop. However, insurance coverage is expensive and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all, and the insurance coverage that we obtain may not be adequate to cover potential claims or losses.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the effectiveness of the product;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf potential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf the price of the product, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; and\n\u25cf sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our product candidates receive regulatory approval but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate product revenues sufficient to attain profitability.\nThe uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the \u201cMMA\u201d), changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.\nThe United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect its ability to sell its products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d), became law in the United States, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA and any amendments thereto may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect the market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, our products that receive regulatory approval. We also cannot predict the impact of ACA and its amendments on us as many of the ACA, as amended, requires the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which have not yet been fully implemented.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nInnoviva may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nUpon closing of both the first and second tranche of the February 2022 Private Placement, Innoviva expects to own approximately 70% of our outstanding shares and 19,364,647 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. If Innoviva were to exercise the warrants held by them, they would hold approximately 77.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Innoviva\u2019s large ownership stake may allow it to exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our articles of incorporation, adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination involving us, and approval of other major corporate transactions. In addition, Innoviva\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Accordingly, our stockholders other than Innoviva may be unable to influence management and exercise control over our business.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding common warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,647,219 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.98 per share. As of December 31, 2021, in-the-money warrants included warrants issued to Innoviva during the January 2021 Private Placement which have an exercise price of $3.25, as well as warrants issued to Innoviva during the 2020 Private Placement which have an exercise price of $2.87 per share. We also have outstanding options to exercise 2,409,682 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $5.64 per share. Although we cannot determine when these warrants or options will ultimately be exercised, it is reasonable to assume that such warrants and options will be exercised only if the exercise price is below the market price of our common stock. To the extent any of our outstanding warrants or options are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued that will generally be eligible for resale in the public market (subject to limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act for certain of our warrants and with respect to shares held by our affiliates), which will result in dilution to our security holders. The issuance of additional securities could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business and operations might be adversely affected by security breaches, including any cybersecurity incidents.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and those of third parties with which we contract, which we use for, among other things, sensitive company data, including our financial data, intellectual property and other proprietary business information.\nWhile certain of our operations have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and other security measures intended to prevent and minimize the impact of IT-related interruptions, our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our consultants, contractors and vendors are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, ransomware and other malware incidents, computer viruses, unauthorized access, electrical failures and natural disasters, terrorism, war or other catastrophic events. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities, targeted phage therapies, bacteriophage product candidates and other business operations. The loss of data from completed or future studies or clinical trials could result in delays in our research, development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. For example, we are not insured against terrorist attacks or cyberattacks. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results. Moreover, any such event could delay the development of our product candidates.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We face\nrisks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk and the risk of being unable to adequately monitor our controls.\nThe U.S. Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services enforces the HIPAA privacy and security rules and may impose penalties for failure to comply with requirements of HIPAA. Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as whether failure to comply was due to willful neglect. These penalties include civil monetary penalties of $100 to $50,000 per violation, up to an annual cap of $1,500,000 for identical violations. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 per violation and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 per violation and up to five-years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 per violation and up to 10-years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, there are reporting requirements to the U.S. Office of Civil Rights under the HIPAA regulations as well as to affected individuals, and there may also be additional reporting requirements to other state and federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, and to the media. Issuing such notifications can be costly, time and resource intensive, and can generate significant negative publicity. Breaches of HIPAA may also constitute contractual violations that could lead to contractual damages or terminations.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations vary between states, may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. For example, we may be subject to privacy laws and regulations such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). These regulations mandate that companies satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection, and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, CCPA, and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, negative publicity, or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nInterruptions in the availability of server systems or communications with Internet or cloud based services, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility or integrity of data stored on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe rely upon a variety of Internet service providers, third-party hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers to support our business. Failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility or integrity of data stored on such systems could damage our reputation in the market, cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs, subject us to liability for damages and/or fines and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any damage to, or failure of, such systems, or communications to and between such systems, could result in interruptions in our operations. If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe do not have control over the operations of the facilities of our cloud service providers and our third-party providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks,\npower outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. In addition, any changes in our cloud service providers\u2019 service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet our requirements and operate our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have three securities analysts and may never obtain additional research coverage by other securities and industry analysts. If no additional securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If we obtain additional securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock by us, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating as a public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d), our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2016 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st of each year by up to 5% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31st of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, we may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d). The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st of each calendar year by the lessor of 1% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year and 30,000 shares, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan and ESPP each year. Increases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions of Washington law and our current articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Washington law and our current articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u25cf requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Washington, we are governed by the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act, which, among other things, restricts the ability of stockholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our profitability will be negatively affected.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), state and federal environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. OSHA, state governments or federal Environmental Protection Agency, may adopt regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations.\nAlthough we believe our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use,\nstorage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage.\nTaxing authorities could reallocate our taxable income among our subsidiaries, which could increase our overall tax liability.\nWe are organized in the United States, and we currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Australia. If we succeed in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased operations through our subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions pursuant to transfer pricing arrangements between us and our subsidiaries. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arm\u2019s length and that appropriate documentation is maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities.\nIf tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm\u2019s length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased scrutiny of our environmental, social or governance responsibilities will likely result in additional costs and risks and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, including corporate citizenship and sustainability. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies\u2019 ESG practices continues to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or stakeholders\u2019 evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, support for local communities, Board of Director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, corporate governance and transparency and employing ESG strategies in our operations, our brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us.\nIn addition, aligning our ESG practices with industry standards will likely require us to expand our disclosures in these areas. We also expect to incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with our various ESG practices. The standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. The disclosure frameworks we choose to align with, if any, may change from time-to-time and may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period. Ensuring there are systems and processes in place to comply with various ESG tracking and reporting obligations will require management time and expense. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\nIf we fail to adopt ESG standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire, fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Our business could be negatively impacted by such matters. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 80577, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARMP"}
