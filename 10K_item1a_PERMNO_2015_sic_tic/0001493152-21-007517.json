{"cik": "1021435", "company": "hopTo Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The risk factors described below include the considerable risks associated with the current economic environment and the related potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating and net losses.\nWe have experienced significant operating and net losses since we began operations. After years of losses, we had net income for 2019 of $554,300 and 2020 of $693,700; however, such improvement in our financial performance could reverse if our GO-Global business, our only source of revenue, declines or if we are unable to maintain control over our expenses.\nThe coronavirus pandemic could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe recent coronavirus pandemic throughout the United States and the world has resulted in the United States and other countries halting or sharply curtailing the movement of people, goods and services. All of this has caused extended shutdowns of businesses and the prolonged economic impact remains uncertain. At this point, we believe the conditions will have a material adverse effect on our business but given the rapidly changing developments we cannot accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our business, which will depend on, among other factors, the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the duration of the outbreak and travel restrictions and business closures imposed by the United States and various other governments.\nOur revenue is typically generated from a limited number of resellers.\nA material portion of our revenue, all of which is currently derived from our GO-Global products, during any reporting period is typically generated from a limited number of resellers in certain countries or geographic regions, all of which are unrelated third parties. We are seeking to expand the number of resellers of our GO-Global products to grow our revenues and diversify our revenue geographically. However, our inability to expand the number of resellers and/or a reduction in the orders from our current resellers could materially adversely impact our revenues.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by:\n\u25cf frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements;\n\u25cf rapid technological change;\n\u25cf evolving industry standards;\n\u25cf fluctuations in customer demand; and\n\u25cf changes in customer requirements.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and develop and introduce new features and capabilities that our customers choose to buy. If we are unable to satisfy our customers\u2019 demands and remain competitive with other products that could satisfy their needs by introducing new features, capabilities and enhancements, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. Our future success could be hindered by, among other factors:\n\u25cf the amount of cash we have available to fund investment in new products and enhancements;\n\u25cf the reduced level of research and development resources that we have available in the Company to perform the work necessary to develop new features and capabilities\n\u25cf delays in our introduction of new features, capabilities and/or enhancements of existing products;\n\u25cf disruptions in our operations or customer relations due to the coronavirus pandemic;\n\u25cf delays in market acceptance of new products and/or enhancements of existing products; and\n\u25cf a competitor\u2019s announcement of new products and/or product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products.\nFor example, sales of our GO-Global software could be affected by the announcement from Microsoft of an intended release, and the subsequent actual release, of a new Windows-based operating system, or an upgrade to a previously released Windows-based operating system version. These new or upgraded systems may contain similar features to our products or they could contain architectural changes that would temporarily prevent our products from functioning properly within a Windows-based operating system environment.\nWe are subject to various liquidity risks.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $79,240,700 and a working capital of $3,281,600. Our ability to continue to generate net profits and positive cash flows from operations is dependent on our ability to continue to generate revenue from our legacy GO-Global business, which in turn is subject to a variety of risks, some of which are described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a small company, we have limited ability to deploy new revenue increasing opportunities, and limited flexibility to respond to unforeseen adverse developments, such as customer losses, adverse market developments or unanticipated expenses. Although our current operating plan does not call for the raising of new capital, if we need to raise new capital, our ability to do so is extremely limited given our small market capitalization and the limited volume in the trading of our common stock.\nIf we do need to issue new equity, such issuances may be at a significant discount to market prices, would dilute existing stockholders and may give the purchasers of new capital stock additional rights, preferences and privileges relative to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional capital necessary for any execution of our operations will be available on a timely basis, on reasonable terms or at all.\nChallenges to develop new business may reverse the improvements in our finances.\nOur management believes that any significant improvement in our cash flow must result from increases in revenues from existing sources and from new revenue sources. Our ability to develop new revenues depends on many factors not in our control, or only partially in its control, including available capital resources which affect the extent of our marketing activities and our research and development activities, all of which are limited by our small size and revenue base. We cannot assure you that the resources that we can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable us to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future.\nSales of products within our GO-Global product families are likely to be our only source of revenue during 2021.\nSales of products within our GO-Global product families, and related enhancements, were our only source of revenue during 2020 and will continue to be our only source of revenue during 2021. The success, if any, of our new GO-Global releases may depend on a number of factors, including market acceptance of the new GO-Global releases and our ability to manage the risks associated with introducing such releases. Declines in demand for our GO-Global products could occur as a result of, among other factors:\n\u25cf lack of success with our strategic partners;\n\u25cf new competitive product releases and updates to existing competitive products;\n\u25cf decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels;\n\u25cf price competition;\n\u25cf technological changes;\n\u25cf disruptions in our operations or customer relations due to the coronavirus pandemic; or\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nIf our customers do not continue to purchase GO-Global products as a result of these or other factors, our revenue would decrease and our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur operating results in one or more future periods are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future on a quarterly and annual basis due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Factors that could cause our operating results and therefore our revenues to fluctuate include the following, among other factors:\n\u25cf variations in the size of orders by our customers;\n\u25cf increased competition;\n\u25cf disruptions in our operations or customer relations due to the coronavirus pandemic; and\n\u25cf the proportion of overall revenues derived from different sales channels such as distributors, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) and others.\nIn addition, our royalty and license revenues are impacted by fluctuations in OEM licensing activity from quarter to quarter, which may involve one-time orders from non-recurring customers, or customers who order infrequently. Our expense levels are based, in part, on expected future orders and sales; therefore, if orders and sales levels are below expectations, our operating results are likely to be materially adversely affected. Additionally, because significant portions of our expenses are fixed, a reduction in sales levels may disproportionately affect our net financial results. Also, we may reduce prices and/or increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. Because of these factors, our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected.\nWe will encounter challenges in recruiting, hiring and retaining new personnel and/or replacements for any members of key management or other personnel who depart.\nOur success and business strategy is dependent in large part on our ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel in certain areas of our business. If any of these employees were to leave, we would need to attract and retain replacements for them. We have lost employees, including at the officer level and in our new products engineering group, in the past. Without a successful replacement, the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management group and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and any officer or other employee can terminate their relationship with us at any time. We may also need to add key personnel in the future in order to successfully implement our business strategies. The market for such qualified personnel is highly competitive and it includes other potential employers whose financial resources for such qualified personnel are more substantial than ours. Consequently, we could find it difficult to attract, assimilate or retain such qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to successfully implement our business strategies.\nWe have sought to match our expenses structure with business opportunities, but this creates risks. We rely on the considerable expertise of our Board of Directors and the moderate use of professional advisors. This arrangement limits our ability to respond to challenges and develop opportunities. Should we revise our approach to management by hiring additional resources, this too, can create risks to the cost savings we have achieved, if any anticipated business opportunities are not realized.\nOur failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us.\nOur commercial success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. These measures afford only limited protection. We cannot assure you that measures we have taken or may take in the future will be adequate to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the existence of any proprietary rights will prevent the development of competitive products. The infringement upon, or loss of, any proprietary rights, or the development of competitive products despite such proprietary rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business significantly benefits from strategic relationships and there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue in the future.\nOur business and strategy rely to a significant extent on our strategic relationships with other companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or further develop any of these relationships or to replace them in the event any of these relationships are terminated. In addition, any failure to renew or extend any license between any third party and us may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels for our products and may not be able to retain existing reseller relationships or develop new reseller relationships.\nOur GO-Global products are primarily sold through several distribution channels. An integral part of our strategy is to strengthen our relationships with resellers such as OEMs, systems integrators, value-added resellers s, distributors and other vendors to encourage these parties to recommend or distribute our products and to add resellers both domestically and internationally. We currently invest, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to expand our sales and marketing capabilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and/or retain resellers to market our products effectively. Our inability to attract resellers and the loss of any current reseller relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that resellers will devote enough resources to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive and have more established competitors.\nThe markets we participate in with GO-Global are intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to continuous technological changes. We expect competition to increase in each of these markets as other companies introduce additional competitive products. In order to compete effectively, we must continually develop and market new and enhanced products and market those products at competitive prices. As markets for our products continue to develop, additional companies, including companies in the computer hardware, software and networking industries with significant market presence, may enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. A number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, sales, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. We cannot give any assurance that our competitors will not develop and market competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features, or that new competitors will not enter our markets and offer such products. We believe that we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to remain competitive in the future in each of the markets in which we compete. Such financial resources may not be available to us at the time or times that we need them, or upon terms acceptable to us, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and maintain a significant market position in the face of our competition and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock is thinly traded and its price has been historically volatile.\nOur stock is thinly traded. As such, holders of our stock are subject to a high risk of illiquidity, e.g., you may not be able to sell as many shares at the price you would like, or you may not be able to purchase as many shares at the price you would like, due to the low average daily trading volume of our stock. Additionally, the market price of our stock has historically been volatile; it has fluctuated significantly to date. The trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose some or all of its value.\nFuture sales of our common stock could adversely affect its price and our future capital-raising activities, and could involve the issuance of additional equity securities, which would dilute current stockholder investments in our common stock and could result in lowering the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our management team and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions and issue securities with rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock, and we may issue securities at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may make acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and seriously harm our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to make acquisitions in the future (although we do not currently have any probable acquisitions). Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate larger or more complex companies, products, and technologies is unproven. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, if we fail to successfully close transactions or integrate new teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into our company, our business could be seriously harmed. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired products, technology, and personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities that we assume as a result of acquiring companies. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition, any of which could seriously harm our business. Selling equity to finance any such acquisitions would also dilute our stockholders. Incurring debt would increase our fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.\nIn addition, on average, it is difficult to finalize the purchase price allocation and accounting. Therefore, it is possible that our valuation of an acquisition may change and result in unanticipated write-offs or charges, impairment of our goodwill, or a material change to the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with a particular acquisition, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are not likely to have the capital to acquire large businesses. Therefore, the businesses we acquire may require significant investment in corporate infrastructure, repositioning, incremental sales, marketing or product development.\nOur acquisition strategy may not succeed if we are unable to remain attractive to target companies or expeditiously close transactions.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of these shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding warrants for an aggregate of 248,216 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 93,076 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.03 per share. The holders may sell these shares exercisable under warrants or options in the public markets from time to time. In addition, if our stock price rises, more outstanding warrants and options will be \u201cin-the-money\u201d and the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is quoted on the FINRA OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is currently quoted under the symbol \u201cHPTO\u201d on the OTC Bulletin Board market (\u201cOTCBB\u201d) operated by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and on the OTC Markets Group QB tier (\u201cOTCQB\u201d). Neither the OTCBB nor the OTCQB is a \u201cnational securities exchange,\u201d and in general, each is a significantly more limited market than the markets operated by the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The quotation of our shares on the OTCBB and the OTCQB could result in a less liquid market being available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, which could depress the trading price of our common stock and have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. Because of the limited trading market for our common stock, and because of the significant price volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of common stock when they want to do so. We may not support any continued trading market for our shares.\nOur stock may lose access to a viable trading market.\nGiven the increasing cost and resource demands of being a public company, we may decide to \u201cgo dark,\u201d or discontinue our obligation to make periodic filings with the SEC, by deregistering our securities, for a period of time until our assets and stockholder base are sufficient to warrant public trading again. During such time, there would be a substantial decrease in disclosure by us of our operations and prospects, and a substantial decrease in the liquidity in our common stock even though stockholders may still continue to trade our common stock in the OTC market or \u201cpink sheets.\u201d The market\u2019s interpretation of a company\u2019s motivation for \u201cgoing dark\u201d varies from cost savings, to negative changes in the firm\u2019s prospects, to serving insider interests, which may affect the overall price and liquidity of a company\u2019s securities.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the operations and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon the earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and other factors as deemed necessary by our Board of Directors.\nFINRA\u2019s sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA\u2019s requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and our Rights Agreement may prevent or discourage third parties or our stockholders from attempting to replace our management or influencing significant decisions.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include, but are not limited to, authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders and providing that stockholders cannot take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting. In addition, our Rights Agreement, entered into by us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (as rights agent) on February 16, 2018, as amended on November 2, 2018 and February 16, 2021 (collectively, the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d), works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group (including a group of persons that are acting in concert with each other) that acquires five percent (5%) or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the rights thereunder may be to render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving that is not approved by our board of directors. The Rights Agreement is not intended to interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our board of directors. Nor does the Rights Agreement prevent the Board from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Rights Agreement expired at or prior to the earlier of (i) February 16, 2031 or (ii) the redemption or exchange of the rights thereunder, as provided for in the Rights Agreement. Together, these charter and contractual arrangements could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u25cf authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf providing our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u25cf limiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u25cf requiring a supermajority of two-thirds of stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or to amend our bylaws.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87163, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "HPTO"}
