{"cik": "1603923", "company": "Weatherford International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all the risk factors described below, the matters discussed herein under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K, were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, especially a substantial or extended decline, affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services and products is tied to the level of exploration, development and production activity and the corresponding capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. Therefore, declines in oil and natural gas prices or sustained low oil and natural gas prices or customer perceptions that oil and natural gas prices will remain depressed or will further decrease in the future could result in a continued reduction in the demand and pricing for our equipment and will likely continue at lower rates for our services.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are highly volatile and fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. Factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations include: excess supply of crude oil relative to demand; domestic and international drilling activity; global market uncertainty; the risk of slowing economic growth or recession in the United States, China, Europe or emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East; the ability or willingness of OPEC and other non-member nations, including Russia, to set and maintain production levels for oil; the decision of OPEC or other non-member nations to abandon production quotas and/or member-country quota compliance within OPEC agreements; oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries; the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation; technological advances affecting energy consumption; adverse weather conditions and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. For example, in March 2020, members of OPEC and Russia considered extending their previously agreed oil production cuts and potentially making additional oil production cuts. However, these negotiations were unsuccessful. Saudi Arabia has announced a significant reduction in its export prices effective immediately and Russia has announced that all agreed oil production cuts between members of OPEC and Russia will expire on April 1, 2020. Following these announcements, global oil and natural gas prices declined sharply and may continue to decline. Any perceived or actual further reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity and decrease spending by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSustained lower oil and natural gas prices have led to a significant decrease in spending by our customers over the past several years, which have led to significantly decreased revenues. Further decreases in oil and natural gas prices could lead to further cuts in spending and potential lower revenues for the company. Several large oil and gas exploration and production companies have recently announced reductions in their previously announced planned capital expenditures during 2020 in light of declining global oil and natural gas prices. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors when determining whether to pursue capital projects and higher perceived risks generally mandate higher required returns. Any of these factors have and could further affect the demand for oil and natural gas and has and could further have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers and reductions in capital spending by our customers has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSustained low oil and natural gas prices have led to lower spending by our customers. Most of our contracts can be cancelled by our customers at any time. Low commodity prices, the short-term tenor of most of our contracts and the potential extreme financial stress experienced by our customers (some of whom may have to seek bankruptcy protection), have combined to generate demands by many of our customers for reductions in the prices of our products and services. Further reductions in capital spending or requests for further cost reductions by our customers could, directly impact our business by reducing demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets, which have been volatile in recent years. Limitations on the availability of capital or higher costs of capital may cause exploration and production companies\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 10\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nto make additional reductions to capital budgets even if oil and natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending would curtail drilling programs, as well as, discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. With respect to national oil company customers, we are also subject to risk of policy, regime, currency and budgetary changes all of which may affect their capital expenditures.\nWeakened global macro-economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide macro-economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These global macro-economic conditions can suddenly arise and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.\nPublic health threats could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPublic health threats, such as severe influenza, COVID-19 and other highly communicable viruses or diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate, could adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services. The quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or customer facilities could adversely affect our operations. Travel operational, or logistical restrictions in any part of the world in which we operate, or any reduction in the demand for our products and services caused by public health threats in the future, may materially impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing beyond the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant professional fees and other costs following the Cases and our emergence from bankruptcy. We cannot assure you that cash on hand, cash flow from operations and any financing we are able to obtain through the ABL Credit Agreement and LC Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand; (ii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations; (iii) changes in market conditions that negatively impact our revenue, and (iv) the professional fees and cost related to the Cases and our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe credit risks of our concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in operating losses and negatively impact liquidity.\nThe concentration of our customer base in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers are experiencing financial distress as a result of continued low commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been negatively and significantly affected by low oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 11\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nWe utilize letters of credit and performance and bid bonds to provide credit support to our customers. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit under our committed facilities, our available liquidity would be reduced by the amount called and it could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $399 million of letters of credit and performance and bid bonds outstanding, consisting of $141 million of letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement, $105 million of letters of credit under the LC Credit Agreement and $153 million of letters of credit under various uncommitted facilities. At December 31, 2019, we had cash collateral of $152 million supporting letters of credit under our various uncommitted facilities. The cash is included in \u201cRestricted Cash\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In Latin America we utilize surety bonds as part of our customary business practice. These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries should we breach certain contractual or performance obligations. If the beneficiaries were to call the letters of credit under our committed facilities or the surety bonds, our available liquidity would be reduced by the amount called and it could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition.\nSevere or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Many experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia and the North Sea, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity or result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot responding timely to changes in the market and customer requirements in the highly competitive oilfield services business may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict.\nOur business is highly competitive, particularly with respect to marketing our products and services to our customers and securing equipment and trained personnel. Currently the oilfield service industry has excess capacity relative to customer demand, and, in most cases, multiple sources of comparable oilfield services are available from a number of different competitors. This competitive environment could impact our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase pricing for our products and services and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers and suppliers. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to add value for our customers by providing, relative to our peers, new technologies, reliable products and services and competent personnel. The anticipated timing and cost of the development of competitive technology and new product introductions, could impact our financial results, particularly if one of our competitors were to develop competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services. Additionally, we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active, particularly if one or more of our competitors is already operating in that area of the world.\nMergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share and may result in stronger competitors, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our other competitors or us.\nLiability claims resulting from catastrophic incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nDrilling for and producing hydrocarbons, and the associated products and services that we provide, include inherent dangers that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. At many sites, we depend on other companies and personnel to conduct drilling operations in accordance with appropriate safety standards. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in drilling for oil and natural gas. Any of these events can be the result of human error. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed on more challenging prospects both onshore and offshore, where the occurrence of the types of events mentioned above can have an even more catastrophic impact on people, equipment and the environment. Such events may expose us to significant potential losses.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 12\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nWe may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts typically require that our customers indemnify us for claims arising from the injury or death of their employees (and those of their other contractors), the loss or damage of their equipment (and that of their other contractors), damage to the well or reservoir and pollution originating from the customer\u2019s equipment or from the reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir) and claims arising from catastrophic events, such as a well blowout, fire, explosion and from pollution below the surface. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for claims arising from the injury or death of our employees, the loss or damage of our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole) or pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth or water.\nOur indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, our indemnity arrangements may be held to be overly broad in some courts and/or contrary to public policy in some jurisdictions, and to that extent may be unenforceable. Additionally, some jurisdictions which permit indemnification nonetheless limit its scope by statute. We may be subject to claims brought by third parties or government agencies with respect to which we are not indemnified. Furthermore, the parties from which we seek indemnity may not be solvent, may become bankrupt, may lack resources or insurance to honor their indemnities or may not otherwise be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us. The lack of enforceable indemnification could expose us to significant potential losses.\nFurther, our assets generally are not insured against loss from political violence such as war, terrorism or civil commotion. If any of our assets are damaged or destroyed as a result of an uninsured cause, we could recognize a loss of those assets.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take actions in order to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. If we are required to take such actions, and such actions are not successful, our indebtedness and liabilities could expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.2 billion of long-term debt with $2.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes maturing on December 1, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of our senior notes, we expect to have interest payments of approximately $231 million annually until the maturity of our senior notes. We also have a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement in an aggregate amount of $450 million (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), which was entered into pursuant to the Plan. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement. Our level of indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to the inventory and services needed to operate our business;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to secure additional sources of liquidity, which may or may not be available to us; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors or competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Lower commodity prices and in turn lower demand for our products and services have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on our liquidity position. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business and operations. If we continue to experience operating losses and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through the mechanisms described above or through some combination of other actions, including our potential strategic divestitures and other business operations, then our liquidity needs may exceed availability under our Exit Credit Agreements (as defined herein) and other facilities that we may enter into in the future, and we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. If we are unable to secure such additional funds, we may not be able to meet our future obligations as they become due.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 13\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nOur business may be exposed to uninsured claims and, as a result, litigation might result in significant potential losses. The cost of our insured risk management program may increase.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims and litigation. We maintain liability insurance, which includes insurance against damage to people, property and the environment, up to maximum limits of $435 million, subject to self-insured retentions and deductibles.\nOur insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases, for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring, and in some cases those potential losses could be material.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or our insurance may not cover all losses. For example, although we maintain product liability insurance, this type of insurance is limited in coverage and it is possible an adverse claim could arise in excess of our coverage. Additionally, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and may be unavailable on terms that we or our customers believe are economically acceptable. Reductions in coverage, changes in the insurance markets and accidents affecting our industry may result in further increases in our cost and higher deductibles and retentions in future years and may also result in reduced activity levels in certain markets. As a result, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Any of these events would have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, treaties and international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change and alternate energy sources that may expose us to significant liabilities, result in additional compliance costs and could reduce our business opportunities and revenues.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. These laws are often complex and may not always be applied consistently in emerging markets. These laws and regulations often change and can cover broad subject matters, including tax, trade, customs (import/export), the environment, greenhouse gases, climate change and alternate energy sources. In the case of environmental regulations, an environmental claim could arise with respect to one or more of our current businesses, products or services, or a business or property that one of our predecessors owned or used, and such claims could involve material expenditures. Generally, environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties and have increased the costs associated with complying with the more stringent laws and regulations. The scope of regulation of our industry and our products and services may increase further, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. For example, state, national and international governments and agencies in areas in which we conduct business continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. We also cannot ensure that our future business in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, if any, will be profitable in light of regulations that have been, and may continue to be, promulgated and in light of the current risk environment and insurance markets. Additional regulations on deepwater drilling elsewhere in the world could be imposed, and those regulations could limit our business where they are imposed.\nIn addition, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of several states within the U.S. frequently review, consider and propose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. We previously provided (and may, in the future, resume providing) fracturing services to customers and regulators are investigating whether any chemicals used in the fracturing process might adversely affect groundwater or whether the fracturing processes could lead to other unintended effects or damages. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. In recent years, several cities and states within the U.S. passed new laws and regulations concerning or banning hydraulic fracturing. A significant portion of North American service activity today is directed at prospects that require hydraulic fracturing in order to produce hydrocarbons. Therefore, additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business by subjecting fracturing to more stringent regulation. Such regulation, among other things, may change construction standards for wells intended for hydraulic fracturing, require additional certifications concerning the conduct of hydraulic fracturing operations, change requirements pertaining to the management of water used in hydraulic fracturing operations, require other measures intended to prevent operational hazards or ban hydraulic fracturing completely. Any such federal, state, local or foreign legislation could increase our costs of providing services or could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation or if we are not able to pass along any cost increases to our customers. We are unable to predict whether changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 14\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nwill ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nFinally, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d) that requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement entered into was in full force in November 2016. On June 1, 2017, the President of the U.S. announced that the U.S. planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. The implementation of this treaty and other efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. and other countries could materially affect our customers by reducing demand for oil and natural gas, thereby potentially materially affecting demand for our services.\nIf our long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets and other assets are impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.\nWe recognize impairments of goodwill when the fair value of any of our reporting units becomes less than its carrying value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about future cash flows of each reporting unit, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. Based on the uncertainty of future revenue growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate our reporting units\u2019 fair value, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the over 80 countries in which we operate.\nOur non-United States operations accounted for $3.9 billion of our combined consolidated revenue in 2019, $4.1 billion in 2018 and $4.1 billion in 2017. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nvolatility in political, social and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nexposure to expropriation of our assets or other governmental actions;\n\u2022\nsocial unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022\nconfiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022\ndeprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\ntrade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other countries;\n\u2022\nexposure under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar legislation;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange controls;\n\u2022\ninflation; and\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations.\nOur ability to retain or attract skilled employees, including executive officers and other key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified employees, including executive officers and other key personnel. Our operations require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical support and services. Our ability to meet such employment needs is subject to external and internal factors such as the current and future prices of oil and natural gas, the demand for employees by companies in our industry, our reputation within the labor market (particularly in our highly competitive industry), as well as our employees\u2019 perception of opportunities with us as compared to our peers (including as to our financial performance and incentives related thereto). Furthermore, these internal and external factors may also be impacted by our recent emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing us and the business environment and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified employees, the quality of products and services we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. Further, we depend on the contributions of key personnel for our future success. Departures of key employees can cause disruptions to, and\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 15\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nuncertainty in, our business and operations. Future departures of key employees, including changes in our senior management, could disrupt our business and have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Exit Credit Agreements and the indenture governing our Exit Notes, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would affect our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that is not cured or waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest our indebtedness and, in the case of our Exit Notes, substantially decrease the market value of such indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness (including covenants in the Exit Credit Agreements and the indenture governing our Exit Notes), we could be in default under the terms of such agreements. In the event of such default:\n\u2022\nthe holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under such agreements could elect to terminate their commitment thereunder and cease making further loans; and;\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers under the Exit Credit Agreements, the indenture governing our Exit Notes or agreements governing any other outstanding indebtedness. If we breach our covenants under the Exit Credit Agreements, the indenture governing our Exit Notes or the agreements governing any other outstanding indebtedness, and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders, as applicable. If this occurs, we would be in default under such agreements, the lenders, holders or trustee, as applicable, could exercise their rights or remedies, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and the implementation of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. The failure of any such results, or any other developments contemplated by the Plan, to materialize, or of any such results or developments to have the anticipated effect on us and our subsidiaries or our business or operations, could materially adversely our business and prospects as a post-emergence company.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting and adjusted our assets and liabilities to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero. Fresh start accounting results in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes on December 13, 2019, the effective date of the Plan. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby may materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our ordinary shares.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 16\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant shareholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nIn the aggregate, certain funds associated with our largest eight shareholders currently own in excess of 80% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Circumstances may arise in which this shareholder may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our ordinary shares. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership post-emergence may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant shareholders.\nAn active trading market for our ordinary shares may not develop.\nDuring bankruptcy, our old ordinary shares were traded on the OTC Pink Marketplace. Immediately following emergence from bankruptcy, our New Ordinary Shares (as defined herein) were not initially listed on any national or regional securities exchange or quoted on any over-the-counter market. Subsequent to emergence our ordinary shares began quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace.\nHowever, we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become. In addition, no assurances can be given regarding when, and if, we will resume our listing on a national exchange, including whether or not we will be able to meet applicable listing standards for any such exchange. If an active trading market does not develop, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling any of our ordinary shares that may now be owned or may purchase later. In addition, until we are able resume our listing on a national exchange, the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our ordinary shares may be reduced, we may receive decreased news and analyst coverage and we may be limited in our ability issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe price and trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly.\nEven if an active trading market develops for our ordinary shares, the market price of our ordinary shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our ordinary shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares may prevent one from being able to sell shares at or above the ordinary share issuance price or above the price one paid to acquire the ordinary shares. The market price for our ordinary shares could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour new capital structure as a result of the Plan transactions;\n\u2022\nour limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nour limited trading volume;\n\u2022\nthe concentration of holdings of our ordinary shares;\n\u2022\nthe lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow;\n\u2022\nthe nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets; and\n\u2022\nbusiness conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions.\nIf credit rating agencies lower our credit ratings in the future, capital financing may not be available to us at attractive economic rates.\nOn December 16, 2019, after emergence from Chapter 11, S&P Global Ratings assigned us an issuer credit rating of B-, with a negative outlook. S&P assigned a B- for our newly issued Exit Notes and a B+ for our Exit Credit Agreements. Moody\u2019s Investors Service withdrew our credit ratings following the filing of the Plan in Bankruptcy Court in the third quarter of 2019 and resumed rating services after emergence. Upon emergence, Moody\u2019s assigned us an issuer credit rating of B1, with a stable outlook. Moody\u2019s assigned a B2 for our newly issued Exit Notes and a Ba2 for our Exit Credit Agreements. Our credit ratings were subject to multiple downgrades by the credit rating agencies prior to our bankruptcy and could be subject to downgrade again in the future.\nMoreover, our non-investment grade status may limit our ability to refinance our existing debt, could cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable and more restrictive terms and conditions, and could increase certain fees and interest rates of\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 17\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nour borrowings. Suppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances, negatively affect our cash flow and impact our access to the inventory and services needed to operate our business.\nCredit and equity markets have been highly volatile recently, the cost to obtain capital financing has increased, and some markets may not be available at certain times. Credit and equity market conditions and the potential impact on liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund operational needs or other activities through borrowings under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms we believe to be reasonable. In addition, our ability to raise capital through equity financing may be limited by the number of ordinary shares authorized but unissued or reserved for issuance. If we are unable to enhance our borrowings via debt offerings or our credit facilities, or to obtain additional equity financing, we could experience a reduction of liquidity and may result in difficulty funding our operations, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments of interest and other obligations. This could be detrimental to our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Exit Credit Agreements and indenture governing our senior notes contain, and agreements governing our future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets and incur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively, execute our growth strategy or take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our Exit Credit Agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and/or liquidity thresholds under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet those financial ratios or maintain such liquidity thresholds can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the Exit Credit Agreements, the indenture governing our senior notes or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default thereunder. Such a default may allow the lenders, holders or the trustee, as applicable, to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under Exit Credit Agreements would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. If we do not repay our debt out of cash on hand, we could attempt to (i) restructure or refinance such debt, (ii) sell assets or (iii) repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to pay the interest on our debt or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt. The terms of our debt, including our bank credit facility, may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through offerings of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offerings, refinancing or sale of assets. We cannot assure you that any such offerings, restructuring, refinancing or sale of assets will be successfully completed.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 18\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nIf another party claims that we have infringed its intellectual property rights, we may be subject to litigation or we may need to take remedial steps to eliminate or mitigate liability.\nA third-party may claim that we sell equipment or perform services that infringes upon the third-party\u2019s patent rights or unlawfully uses the third-party\u2019s trade secrets. Addressing such claims of patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation could result in significant legal and other costs and may adversely impact our business. To resolve such claims, we may be required to enter into license agreements that require us to make royalty payments to continue selling equipment or providing of services. Alternatively, the development of non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If an allegation of patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation cannot be resolved through a license agreement, we might not be able to continue selling particular equipment or providing particular services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity incidents and other technology disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity incidents such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer, supplier and employee information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyber-attacks, and other similar events. These incidents arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, human error, complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cyber incidents, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or be able to avoid a material impact to our systems should such incidents or attacks occur. A cybersecurity incident or attack, could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer, supplier or employee information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers, suppliers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber-incident could go unnoticed for a period time. As cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve, we may also be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyber-attack or other incident. Any cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in tax laws both in the United States and abroad, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could significantly increase our tax expense and require us to take actions, at potential significant expense, to seek to preserve our current level of tax expense.\nIn 2002, we reorganized from the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. There are frequent legislative proposals in the United States that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to United States subsidiaries of these corporations. Our tax expense could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, acting in unison or separately. The inability to reduce our tax expense could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued various white papers addressing Tax Base Erosion and Jurisdictional Profit Shifting. The recommendations in these white papers are generally aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by these white papers as well as other factors and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws.\nOur effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries in which we operate with differing tax rates, changes in tax laws, or changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 19\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nallowance may be required. We have recorded a valuation allowance on substantially all of our current and future deferred tax assets. A prolonged downturn could result in us not being able to benefit future losses, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our shares, such holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nAs a result of the TCJA, many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are now classified as \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes due to the expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules within a multinational corporate group. If a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares, such person may be treated as a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d with respect to one or more of our controlled foreign corporation subsidiaries. In addition, if our shares are treated as owned more than 50% by United States shareholders, we would be treated as a controlled foreign corporation. A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income, as ordinary income, its pro rata share of \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income\u201d and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, whether or not we make any distributions to such United States shareholder. An individual United States shareholder generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation. A failure by a United States shareholder to comply with its reporting obligations may subject the United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may extend the statute of limitations with respect to the United States shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which such reporting was due. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations or whether any investor is a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporations. We also cannot guarantee that we will furnish to United States shareholders information that may be necessary for them to comply with the aforementioned obligations. United States investors should consult their own advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us. The risk of being subject to increased taxation may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.\nThe United States could treat Weatherford International PLC (parent corporation) as a US taxpayer under IRC Section 7874.\nFollowing the emergence from bankruptcy, Weatherford continues to operate under Weatherford International PLC (PLC), an Irish tax resident. The IRS may, however, assert that PLC should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to IRC Section 7874. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation generally is classified as either a U.S. corporation or a foreign corporation by reference to the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because PLC is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under these rules. IRC Section 7874 provides an exception to this general rule under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under IRC Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% (or 60% in certain circumstances if the Third Country Rule applies) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (the \u201cSection 7874 Percentage\u201d), and (iii) the foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation\u2019s country of organization or incorporation relative to such expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities. Although it is not free from doubt, we believe that as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization, PLC should not be treated as acquiring directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a U.S. corporation and, as a result, PLC is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation or otherwise subject to the adverse tax consequences of IRC Section 7874. The law and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under IRC Section 7874 are, however, unclear and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this conclusion. If it is determined that IRC Section 7874 is applicable, PLC would be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the taxable year of Weatherford US consolidated group could end on or prior to the emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in additional adverse tax consequences. In addition, although PLC would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally also be considered an Irish tax resident for Irish tax and other non-U.S. tax purposes.\nWeatherford International plc - 2019 Form 10-K | 20\nTable of ContentsItem 1A | Risk Factors\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Irish law; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nWe are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive, and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.\nSimilarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.", "PERMNO": 32791, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "WFTLF"}
