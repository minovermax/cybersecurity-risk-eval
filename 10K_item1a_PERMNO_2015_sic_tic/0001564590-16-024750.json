The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities.\nOur Future Success Depends on Continued International Sales\nSales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately 63%, 63% and 65% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not realize such international sales or if our international sales decrease substantially, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur Competitive Position Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes\nTo meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and successful product performance in the market.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our efforts underway obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position.\nInvestments in Future Markets of Potential Significant Growth May Not Result in Expected Returns\nWe previously announced an investment program with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers, especially those used for 3D sensing. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential market may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price. Our technology could fail to fulfill, completely or at all, our target customers\u2019 finalized specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers\u2019 acceptance of our technology. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including consequential damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation.\nWe May Fail to Accurately Estimate Our Customers\u2019 Demand\nWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements.\nCustomers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties.\nAlternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers prior to a downturn to address our customer\u2019s demand, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments, from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Unexpected decline in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and result in additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income.\nGlobal Economic Downturns May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition\nCurrent and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or\ncontraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make.\nGlobal economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers\u2019 products, and in turn, on demand for our products.\nAdverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy, slowdown in the Chinese economy, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries.\nThese changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Global Operations are Complex to Manage\nWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea. Our operations vary by location, are influenced by local customs, languages and work practices as well as different weather conditions, management styles, differences in education from country to country and the inability of management to always act in a timely manner. In addition, different issues may arise in different countries at the same time, further hampering the management\u2019s ability to respond. Inability to respond to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe Have Entered into Supply Agreements which Commit Us to Supply Products on Specified Terms\nWe have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability.\nIf we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply\nOur operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield from growth or fabrication operations, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet.\nWe also make products for which the Company is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. No proven external sources of ZnSe are currently available. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Our potential inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (YLF), Calcium Fluoride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon\nCarbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Global Operations Are Subject to Complex Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea. Operations outside of the U.S. are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, customs import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, anti-competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health, and safety laws and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe May Encounter Substantial Competition\nWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Competitive Position May Require Significant Investments in Strategic Acquisitions\nWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if the financial investments do not result in a significant return on investment or the ability to serve our credit facility covenants due to inability to integrate the business, retain staff, or work with the customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segment\u2019s Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $233.8 million and $14.1 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThere Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nAsserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Governmental Import and Export Regulations\nWe are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nWe are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\n\u00b7\nExported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the U.S.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.\nWe Have Agreements with Government Entities\nOur agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. Failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.\nWe Use and Generate Hazardous Substances that Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulations\nHazardous substances used or generated in our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent.\nWe have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere.\nWith respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.\nThe generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.\nWe do not carry environmental impairment insurance. And, although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulations\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate.\nWe may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.\nData Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results\nIn the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property both proprietary and of our customers, as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations would be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information.\nSome Systems That Use our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues\nSome systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSignificant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs Could Adversely Impact Our Business\nSpecific to the military business within our II-VI Laser Solutions and II-VI Performance Products segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 12% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. These customers generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment. For example, the ongoing sequestration of the defense budget could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel\nWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or\nattract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNatural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Our Results\nWe may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nA Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries\nOur business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreases in Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.\nRegulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact Our Business\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite, including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively known as the \"covered countries\"). Pursuant to these rules, the SEC has adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such minerals were mined from the covered countries, compliance with which began in 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, particularly if there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals that are from recycled or scrap sources, cannot be traced to a country of origin other than the covered countries, or cannot be traced to a source within the covered countries that does not finance or benefit armed groups in those countries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals originating from the covered countries and we cannot definitively determine whether the conflict minerals financed or otherwise benefited armed groups, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement.\nThe Market Price of Our Common Stock Can Be Highly Volatile\nFactors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel and sales of our Common Stock.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nProvisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:\n\u00b7\nA requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;\n\u00b7\nThe ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nCertain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).\nIn addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock.\nBecause We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will Benefit From an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our Common Stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.", "PERMNO": 11752, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "IIVI"}
