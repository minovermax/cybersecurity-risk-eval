RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks associated with an investment in our publicly traded securities and all of the other information in our 2014 Annual Report. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and execute fully our global business strategy.\nOur ability to improve our financial and operational performance and implement the key initiatives of our global business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nimplement our stabilization strategies, cost savings initiatives, restructuring and other initiatives, and achieve anticipated savings and benefits from such programs and initiatives;\n\u2022\nreverse declines in our revenue performance and market share, and strengthen our brand image;\n\u2022\nimplement appropriate pricing strategies and product mix that are more aligned with the preferences of local markets and achieve anticipated benefits from these strategies;\n\u2022\nreduce costs and effectively manage our cost base, particularly selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses;\n\u2022\nimprove our business in North America, including through improving field health, improving our brochure and creating a sustainable cost base;\n\u2022\nexecute investments in information technology infrastructure and realize efficiencies across our supply chain, marketing processes, sales model and organizational structure;\n\u2022\nimplement customer service initiatives;\n\u2022\nimplement and continue to innovate our Internet platform and technology strategies;\n\u2022\noffer a more compelling social selling experience, including the roll-out of e-commerce in certain markets;\n\u2022\neffectively manage our outsourcing activities;\n\u2022\nimprove our marketing and advertising, including our brochures and our social media presence;\n\u2022\nimprove working capital, effectively manage inventory and implement initiatives to reduce inventory levels, including the potential impact on cash flows and obsolescence;\n\u2022\nsecure financing at attractive rates, maintain appropriate capital investment, capital structure and cash flow levels to fund, among other things, cash dividends, and implement cash management, tax, foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies;\n\u2022\nreverse declines in Active Representatives and Representative satisfaction by successfully reducing campaign complexity, enhancing our sales Leadership program, the Representative experience and earnings potential and improving our brand image;\n\u2022\nincrease the productivity of Representatives through successful implementation of field activation programs and technology tools and enablers and other investments in the direct-selling channel;\n\u2022\nimprove management of our businesses in developing markets, including improving local information technology resources and management of local supply chains;\n\u2022\nincrease the number of consumers served per Representative and their engagement online, as well as to reach new consumers through a combination of new brands, new businesses, new channels and pursuit of strategic opportunities such as acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances with other companies;\n\u2022\ncomply with certain covenants in our revolving credit facility as a result of a continued decline in our business results, which includes the impact of any adverse foreign exchange movements, significant restructuring charges and significant legal or regulatory settlements, obtain necessary waivers from compliance with, or necessary amendments to, such covenants, and address the impact any non-compliance with such covenants may have on our ability to secure financing with favorable terms; and\n\u2022\nestimate and achieve any financial projections concerning, for example, future revenue, profit, cash flow, and operating margin increases.\nThere can be no assurance if and when any of these initiatives will be successfully and fully executed or completed.\nWe may experience financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our various restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and benefits of these initiatives.\nIn 2012, we outlined initial steps toward achieving a cost-savings target of $400 before taxes by the end of 2015. In connection with this cost-savings target, in 2012, we announced a cost savings initiative (the \"$400M Cost Savings Initiative\"), in an effort to stabilize the business and return Avon to sustainable growth. While we have achieved the targeted cost savings, we have not yet achieved our targeted low double-digit operating margin primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, inflationary pressures and continued revenue decline in North America. We continue to analyze our cost structure and may incur additional restructuring charges in an effort to achieve our targeted low double-digit operating margin. As we work to right-size our cost structure, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-savings initiatives we may undertake as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. Other events and circumstances, such as financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in our not realizing our targeted low double-digit operating margin. If we are unable to realize these savings or benefits, our ability to continue to fund other initiatives and aspects of our business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not we realize these savings and benefits. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our restructuring and other cost-savings initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to reverse declining revenue, margins and net income and achieve profitable growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to reverse declining revenue, margins and net income, particularly in North America where we experienced continued revenue declines in 2014, and to achieve profitable growth in the future, particularly in our largest markets, such as Brazil and in developing and emerging markets, such as Mexico and Russia. Our revenue in 2014 was $8,851.4 million, compared with $9,955.0 million in 2013 and $10,561.4 million in 2012. Our gross margin in 2014 was 60.5%, compared with 62.1% in 2013 and 61.2% in 2012. Our operating margin in 2014 was 4.5%, compared with 4.3% in 2013 and 5.0% in 2012. In 2014, we had a loss from continuing operations, net of tax of $384.9 million, compared with a loss from continuing operations, net of tax of $1.0 million in 2013, and income from continuing operations, net of tax of $93.3 million in 2012. Reversing these trends will depend on our ability to improve financial and operational performance and execution of our global business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reverse these trends.\nTo reverse these trends in revenue, margins and net income and to achieve profitable growth, we also need to successfully implement certain initiatives including our restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and there can no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our achievement of profitable growth is also subject to the strengths and weaknesses of our individual markets, including our international markets, which are or may be impacted by global economic conditions. We cannot assure that our broad-based geographic portfolio will be able to withstand an economic downturn, recession, cost or wage inflation, commodity cost pressures, economic or political instability, competitive pressures or other market pressures in one or more particular regions.\nFailure to reverse declining revenue, margins and net income and to achieve profitable growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is conducted worldwide primarily in one channel, direct selling.\nOur business is conducted worldwide, primarily in the direct-selling channel. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 6 million active Representatives worldwide. There is a high rate of turnover among Representatives, which is a common characteristic of the direct selling business. In order to reverse losses of Representatives and grow our business in the future, we need to recruit, retain and service Representatives on a continuing basis. Among other things, we need to create attractive Representative earning opportunities and transform the value chain, restore field health and sales force effectiveness, successfully implement other initiatives in the direct-selling channel, successfully execute our digital strategy, including e-commerce, improve our brochure and product offerings and improve our marketing and advertising. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives. Additionally, consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of beauty and related products generally, or reducing purchases from Representatives through direct selling by buying beauty and related products in other channels such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our global business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if we lose market share in the direct-selling channel, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any government bans or severely restricts our business method of direct selling, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to financial risks related to our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions.\nWe operate globally, through operations in various locations around the world, and derive approximately 89% of our consolidated revenue from our operations outside of the United States (\"U.S.\").\nOne risk associated with our international operations is that the functional currency for most of our international operations is their local currency. The primary foreign currencies for which we have significant exposures include the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, the euro, Mexican peso, Peruvian new sol, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Russian ruble, South Africa rand, Turkish lira, Ukrainian hryvna and Venezuelan bol\u00edvar. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to our foreign currencies, our revenues and profits are reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins may be negatively impacted by country mix if our higher margin markets, such as Russia, experience significant devaluation. In addition, our costs are more weighted to U.S. dollars while our sales are denominated in local currencies. Although we typically work to mitigate this negative foreign currency transaction impact through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, we may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. For example, in 2014, our revenues declined 11% compared with 2013 due to unfavorable foreign exchange, and were relatively unchanged on a Constant $ basis. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage these various foreign currency impacts and there can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAnother risk associated with our international operations is the possibility that a foreign government may impose foreign currency remittance restrictions. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, we may not be able to immediately repatriate cash at the official exchange rate. If this should occur, or if the official exchange rate devalues, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. For example, currency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government in 2003 have become more restrictive and have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in Venezuela (Avon Venezuela) to obtain foreign currency to pay for imported products, which in turn has reduced our product offerings in Venezuela and negatively impacted our sales. Unless foreign exchange is made more readily available, Avon Venezuela's operations will continue to be negatively impacted as it will need to obtain more of its foreign currency needs from non-government sources where the exchange rate is less favorable than the official rate.\nInflation is another risk associated with our international operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. High rates of inflation or the related devaluation of foreign currency may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations or cash flows. For example, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy. See \"Segment Review - Latin America\" within MD&A on pages 40 through 44 of our 2014 Annual Report for additional information regarding Venezuela. In addition, there can be no assurance that other countries in which we operate, such as Argentina, will not also become highly inflationary and that our revenue, operating profit and net income will not be adversely impacted as a result.\nWe are subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and a consent to settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which require us to retain, at our own expense, an independent compliance monitor. With the approval of the DOJ and the SEC, the monitor can be replaced 18 months after the monitor\u2019s retention by the Company pursuant to its agreement to undertake self-reporting obligations for the remainder of the monitoring period. The monitoring period expires on the later of three years from the date of the retention of the monitor and the expiration of the DPA. We will incur costs in connection with these obligations, and compliance with these obligations could divert members of management\u2019s time from the operation of our business. Such costs and burdens could be significant.\nIn December 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \"USDC\") approved a deferred prosecution agreement between the Company and the DOJ (the \"DPA\") and in January 2015, the USDC approved a consent to settlement with the SEC (the \"Consent\") in connection with the previously disclosed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") investigations.\nUnder the DPA and the Consent, among other things, the Company agreed to have a compliance monitor (the \"monitor\"). With the approval of the DOJ and the SEC, the monitor can be replaced 18 months after the monitor\u2019s retention by the Company pursuant to its agreement to undertake self-reporting obligations for the remainder of the monitoring period. The monitoring period expires on the later of three years from the date of the retention of the monitor and the expiration of the DPA. We are in the process of retaining a monitor, whose selection is subject to the approval of the DOJ and the SEC. There can be no assurance as to when a monitor will be approved or whether or when the DOJ and the SEC will approve replacing the monitorship with the Company\u2019s self-reporting.\nUnder the DPA, the Company also represented that it has implemented and agreed that it will continue to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws throughout its operations.\nThe monitor will assess and monitor the Company\u2019s compliance with the terms of the DPA. The monitor may recommend changes to our policies and procedures that we must adopt unless they are unduly burdensome or otherwise inadvisable, in which case we may propose alternatives, which the DOJ and the SEC may or may not accept. In addition, operating under the oversight of the monitor may result in burdens on members of our management and divert their time from the operation of our business. Assuming the monitorship is replaced by a self-reporting period, the Company\u2019s self-reporting obligations may continue to be costly or burdensome.\nWe currently cannot estimate the costs that we are likely to incur in connection with compliance with the DPA and the Consent, including the retention of the monitor, the costs, if applicable, of self-reporting, and the costs of implementing the changes, if any, to our policies and procedures required by the monitor. However, the costs and burdens of the monitoring process could be significant.\nIf we commit a breach of the DPA, we may be subject to criminal prosecution. Such criminal prosecution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnder the DPA, the DOJ will defer criminal prosecution of the Company for a term of three years in connection with the charged violations of the FCPA. If the DOJ determines that the Company has knowingly violated the DPA (including the monitoring provisions described in the preceding risk factor), the DOJ may commence prosecution or extend the term of the DPA for up to one year. If the Company remains in compliance with the DPA through its term, the charges against the Company will be dismissed with prejudice.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the DPA could result in criminal prosecution by the DOJ, including for the charged violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA that were included in the information that was filed in connection with the DPA. Under such circumstance, the DOJ would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we made in the DPA and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses. Such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets, such as Russia, or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings.\nCurrent global macro-economic instability or a further downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions or markets, such as Russia, could adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings. Global economic events over the past few years, including high unemployment levels, the tightening of credit markets and failures of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. In addition, as mentioned above, our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by such economic, operational or business challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources and credit ratings, including our ability to access short-term financing, raise additional capital, reduce flexibility with respect to working capital, and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances.\nConsumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. We may face continued economic challenges in fiscal 2015 because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and weakness in housing, among other things.\nIn addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions and consumer spending may result from acts of terror, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, such as the significant typhoon which impacted the Philippines in 2013, and pandemic situations or large scale power outages, none of which are under our control.\nOur credit ratings were downgraded in 2014, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing, and increase financing costs. A further downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity, and our working capital.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to our long-term debt. In 2014, our credit ratings were downgraded. Our current long-term credit ratings are Ba1 (Stable Outlook) with Moody's, BB+ (Stable Outlook)\nwith S&P, and BB (Negative Outlook) with Fitch, which are below investment grade. Additional rating agency reviews could result in a further change in outlook or downgrade. Our credit ratings could limit our access to new financing, particularly short-term financing; reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs; adversely affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt securities; result in an increase in financing costs, including interest expense under certain of our debt instruments; and result in less favorable covenants and financial terms of our financing arrangements. For example, as of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $122 million outstanding in short-term borrowings of our international subsidiaries. A further change in outlook or downgrade of our credit ratings may increase some of these risks and limit our access to such short-term financing in the future on favorable terms, if at all. See Note 5, Debt and Other Financing, on pages through of our 2014 Annual Report for details about the terms of our existing debt and other financing arrangements.\nOur ability to conduct business, particularly in international markets, may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to achieve growth, particularly in new international markets, and to improve operations, particularly in our existing international markets, is exposed to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a foreign government might ban, halt or severely restrict our business, including our primary method of direct-selling;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that local civil unrest, economic or political instability, bureaucratic delays, changes in macro-economic conditions, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships (including any sanctions, restrictions and other responses such as those related to Russia and Ukraine) or other uncertainties might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u2022\nthe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, including exposure to tax assessments without prior notice or the opportunity to review the basis for any such assessments in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on our Representatives, as direct sellers, or on Avon, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets, or additional taxes on our products, including in Brazil; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our Representatives as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our Representatives.\nWe are also subject to the adoption, interpretation and enforcement by governmental agencies in the U.S. (including on federal, state and local levels) and abroad of other laws, rules, regulations or policies, including any changes thereto, such as restrictions on trade, competition, manufacturing, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, anti-corruption laws, environmental laws, records and information management, tariffs and taxes, laws relating to the sourcing of \"conflict minerals,\" health care reform requirements such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act, and regulation of our brochures, product claims or ingredients, which may require us to adjust our operations and systems in certain markets where we do business. For example, we are subject to government review of our brochures in Venezuela. Another example is privacy and data protection laws which are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, and which may vary among the various jurisdictions where we operate. If we are unable to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements, our business and/or reputation may be adversely affected. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or the impact that pending or future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business in the future.\nWe face intense competition and can make no assurances about our ability to overcome our competitive challenges.\nWe face intense competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Worldwide, we compete against products sold to consumers in a number of distribution methods, including direct selling, through the Internet, and through mass market retail and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing direct-selling and retail competition in our developing and emerging markets, particularly Brazil.\nWithin the direct-selling channel, we compete on a regional, and often country-by-country, basis with our direct-selling competitors. There are a number of direct-selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. Unlike a typical consumer packaged goods (\"CPG\") company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, direct sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity or \"better deal\" than that offered by the competition. Providing a compelling earnings opportunity for our Representatives is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. Therefore, in contrast to typical CPG companies, we must first compete for a limited pool of Representatives before we reach the ultimate consumer.\nRepresentatives are attracted to a direct seller by competitive earnings opportunities, often through what are commonly known as \"field incentives\" in the direct-selling industry. Competitors devote substantial effort to finding out the effectiveness of such incentives so that they can invest in incentives that are the most cost-effective or produce the better payback. As one of the largest and oldest beauty direct sellers globally, Avon's business model and strategies are often highly sought after, particularly by smaller and more nimble competitors who seek to capitalize on our investment and experience. As a result, we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of Representatives from other direct-selling or network marketing organizations. It is therefore continually necessary to innovate and enhance our direct-selling and service model as well as to recruit and retain new Representatives. If we are unable to do so, our business will be adversely affected.\nWithin the broader CPG industry, we principally compete against large and well-known cosmetics (color), fragrance and skincare companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell more narrow beauty product lines sold through retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. This industry is highly competitive, and some of our principal competitors in the CPG industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. We also have many highly competitive global branded and private label competitors in the accessories, apparel, housewares, and gift and decorative products industries, including retail establishments, principally department stores, mass merchandisers, gift shops and specialty retailers. Our principal competition in the highly competitive fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers and e-commerce.\nThe number of competitors and degree of competition that we face in the beauty and related products industry varies widely from country to country. If our advertising, promotional, merchandising or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to improve our product mix and offer new products that represent technological breakthroughs and are aligned with local preferences, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, if we are unable to improve the Representative experience, or if for other reasons our Representatives or end customers perceive competitors' products as having greater appeal, then our sales and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty and related products. We must continually work to develop, produce and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. Consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. In addition, certain market trends may be short-lived. There can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate and respond to trends timely and effectively in the market for beauty and related products and changing consumer demands and improve our financial results.\nFurthermore, material shifts or decreases in market demand for our products, including as a result of changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences or incorrect forecasting of market demand, could result in us carrying inventory that cannot be sold at anticipated prices or increased product returns by our Representatives. Failure to maintain proper inventory levels or increased product returns by our Representatives could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on our key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, develop and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy. For example, there have been many changes to the Company's senior management, including a new chief executive officer in 2012 and a new chief financial officer in 2015. Any failure by our management team to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. This risk may be exacerbated by the uncertainties associated with the implementation of our stabilization strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives.\nA failure, disruption, cyberattack or other breach in the security of an information technology system or infrastructure that we utilize could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase our costs.\nWe employ information technology systems to support our business, including systems to support financial reporting, web-based tools, an enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system, and internal communication and data transfer networks. We also employ information technology systems to support Representatives in many of our markets, including electronic order\ncollection, invoicing systems, social media tools and on-line training. We have e-commerce and Internet sites, including business-to-business websites to support Representatives. We use third-party service providers in many instances to provide these information technology systems. Over the last several years, we have undertaken initiatives to increase our reliance on information technology systems which has resulted in the outsourcing of certain services and functions, such as global human resources information technology systems, call center support, Representative support services and other information technology processes. Our information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance.\nAny of our information technology systems and infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, may be susceptible to outages, disruptions, destruction or corruption due to the complex landscape of localized applications and architectures as well as incidents related to legacy or unintegrated systems. These information technology systems and infrastructure also may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, attacks, break-ins, data corruption, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events beyond our control. We rely on our employees, Representatives and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of third party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. Furthermore, our ability to protect and monitor the practices of our third-party service providers is more limited than our ability to protect and monitor our own information technology systems and infrastructure.\nOur information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers may be accessed by unauthorized users such as cyber criminals as a result of a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach, exposing us to risk. As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach may go undetected for a long period of time. A failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our information technology systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of Company, employee, Representative, customer, vendor, or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data, personal information and intellectual property.\nWe are investing in industry standard solutions and protections and monitoring practices of our data and information technology systems and infrastructure to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our information technology systems and infrastructure on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. Such efforts and investments are costly, and as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. As a company that operates worldwide, we could be impacted by commercial agreements between us and processing organizations, existing and proposed laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.\nDespite our efforts, our and our third-party service providers\u2019 data, information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our or our third-party service providers\u2019 information technology systems or infrastructure, or that we will detect and appropriately respond if there is such a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Any such failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach could adversely affect our business including our ability to expand our business, cause damage to our reputation, result in increased costs to address internal data, security, and personnel issues, and result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws and external financial obligations such as governmental fines, penalties, or regulatory proceedings and third-party private litigation with potentially significant costs. In addition, it could result in deterioration in our employees', Representatives', customers', or vendors\u2019 confidence in us, which could cause them to discontinue business with us or result in other competitive disadvantages.\nIn addition, there may be other challenges and risks as we upgrade, modernize, and standardize our information technology systems on a worldwide basis. For example, Service Model Transformation (\"SMT\") was a global program initiated in 2009 to improve the Company's order management system and enable changes to the way Representatives interact with the Company. SMT was piloted in Canada during 2013, and caused significant business disruption in that market. We decided to halt further roll-out of SMT in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, we experienced challenges in implementing an ERP system in Brazil which impacted service levels, which in turn negatively impacted average order and Active Representative and revenue growth during 2011.\nThird-party suppliers provide, among other things, the raw materials used to manufacture our Beauty products, and the loss of these suppliers or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture and package the majority of our Beauty products. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components, are purchased from various third-party suppliers for our Beauty products. All of our Fashion & Home products are purchased from various suppliers. Additionally, we produce the brochures that are used by Representatives to sell Avon products. The loss of multiple suppliers or a significant disruption or interruption in the supply chain could have a material adverse effect on the manufacturing and packaging of our Beauty products, the purchasing of our Fashion & Home products or the production of our brochures. This risk may be exacerbated by our globally-coordinated\npurchasing strategy, which leverages volumes. Regulatory action, such as restrictions on importation, may also disrupt or interrupt our supply chain. Furthermore, increases in the costs of raw materials or other commodities may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as any child labor laws, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.6 billion of indebtedness outstanding. We may also incur additional long-term indebtedness and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, subject to certain restrictions under our indebtedness, including our revolving credit facility, which would increase our total indebtedness. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings and other financing may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our future financial obligations or our other liquidity needs. Our indebtedness could have material negative consequences on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, including the following:\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing sufficient to fund growth, such as working capital and capital expenditures requirements or to meet other cash requirements, in particular during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022\na further downgrade in our credit ratings, as discussed above;\n\u2022\na limitation on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the beauty industry;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we are put at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much debt as us, and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources and withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to execute business development activities to support our strategies or ability to execute restructuring as necessary;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to invest in recruiting, retaining and servicing our Representatives; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with certain covenants in our revolving credit facility as a result of a continued decline in our business results, which includes the impact of any adverse foreign exchange movements, significant restructuring charges and significant legal or regulatory settlements; difficulty obtaining necessary waivers from compliance with, or necessary amendments to, such covenants; and difficulty addressing the impact any non-compliance with such covenants may have on our ability to secure financing with favorable terms.\nIf we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face (including those described above), could intensify.\nOur ability to utilize our foreign tax and other U.S. credits to offset our future taxable income may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $674.8 million of foreign tax and other credits available to offset future income for U.S. federal tax liability purposes. Our ability to utilize such credits to offset future income can be limited, however, if the Company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If the 50 percentage points are exceeded, Section 382 establishes an annual limitation on the amount of deferred tax assets attributable to previously incurred credits that may be used to offset taxable income in future years. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this limitation, and any such limitation would depend in part on the market value of the Company at the time of the ownership change and prevailing interest rates at the time of calculation. As a result, the magnitude of any potential limitation on the use of our deferred tax assets and the effect of such limitation on the Company if an ownership change were to occur is difficult to assess. However, if all or a portion of our deferred tax assets were to become subject to this limitation, our tax liability could increase significantly and our future results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe currently believe an ownership change has not occurred. However, in recent periods, we have experienced fluctuations in the market price of our stock and changes in ownership by our 5% shareholders. We continue to monitor these changes.\nSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance, assumptions relating to pension costs or required legal changes in pension funding rules may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost.\nOur funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, are expected to approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure\npension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, including equity and debt securities and derivative instruments, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Also, while our U.S. defined benefit pension plan has been closed to employees hired on or after January 1, 2015, significant changes in the number and demographics of participants in our pension plans generally may result in additional funding obligations. A change in the discount rate would result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Similarly, changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost of the following fiscal years. Pension funding requirement changes under the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006 and related standards and regulations affect pension funding obligations and may impose limitations on a hybrid plan's interest crediting rate to the \"market rate of return.\" This may result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans. Please see \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Postretirement Expense\" within MD&A on pages 27 through 28 and Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans on pages through of our 2014 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the impact of these factors on our pension plan obligations.\nAny strategic alliances, acquisitions or divestitures may expose us to additional risks.\nWe evaluate potential strategic alliances and acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and/or operating efficiency opportunities. Strategic alliances or acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nsubstantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in leveraging synergies among the businesses to increase sales and obtain cost savings or achieve expected results;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct-selling channel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\nreputational and other risks regarding our ability to successfully implement such strategic alliance or acquisition, including obtaining financing which could dilute the interests of our stockholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any new or acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable alliance and acquisition candidates or consummate alliances and acquisitions on favorable terms.\nFor divestitures, success is also dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested unit or business from the Company and reducing or eliminating associated overhead costs. In cases where a divestiture is not successfully implemented or completed, the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our manufacturing and distribution operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur principal properties consist of worldwide manufacturing facilities for the production of Beauty products, distribution centers where offices are located and where finished merchandise is packed and shipped to Representatives in fulfillment of their orders, and one principal research and development facility. Additionally, we use third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our products. Therefore, as a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems (such as the ERP system), loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, product quality control issues, safety concerns, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. These risks may be exacerbated by our efforts to increase facility consolidation covering our manufacturing, distribution and supply footprints, particularly if we are unable to successfully increase our resiliency to potential operational disruptions or enhance our disaster recovery planning. The loss of, or damage to, any of our facilities or centers, or those of our third-party manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products. If our products are found to be, or perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet our Representatives' or end customers' standards, our relationship with our Representatives or end customers could suffer, we could need to recall some of our products and/or become subject to regulatory action, our reputation or the appeal of our brand could be diminished, we could lose market share, and we could become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trademarks, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We own the material patents and trademarks used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products both in the U.S. and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, there can be no assurance with respect to the rights associated with such intellectual property in those countries. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries, including many emerging markets, such as China, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect our patents and trademarks, especially in those emerging markets, may be substantial.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are and may, in the future, become party to litigation, including, for example, claims alleging violation of the federal securities laws or claims relating to our products or advertising. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect financial results and the conduct of our business. We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these litigation claims. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation to which we currently are or may in the future become party, or to predict the impact of certain of these matters on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. In addition, from time to time we may conduct other internal investigations and compliance reviews, the consequences of which could negatively impact our business or reputation.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to direct selling in emerging and developing markets where we do business is evolving, and government officials in such locations often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, from time to time, we may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews. The consequences of such government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions or such internal investigations and compliance reviews may adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, any determination that our operations or activities, or, where local law mandates, the activities of our Representatives, including our licenses or permits, importing or exporting, or product testing or approvals are not, or were not, in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, civil and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third party relationship, termination of necessary licenses and permits, modification of business practices and compliance programs, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief and other sanctions that we may take against our personnel or that may be taken against us or our personnel. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, as well as government investigations, which often involve complex legal issues and are subject to uncertainties, may also follow as a consequence. Further, other countries in which we do business may initiate their own investigations and impose similar sanctions. These proceedings or investigations could be costly and burdensome to our management, and could adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. Even if an inquiry or investigation does not result in any adverse determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity and give rise to third-party litigation or action.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to fluctuations as a result of many factors.\nFactors that could affect the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in connection with any investigations or litigations;\n\u2022\na change in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions and volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements or significant developments in connection with our business and with respect to beauty and related products or the beauty industry in general;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual financial results;\n\u2022\nunsolicited takeover proposals, proxy contests or other shareholder activism;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend practice;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies and regulations;\n\u2022\nestimates of our future performance or that of our competitors or our industries;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political, and market conditions;\n\u2022\nmarket rumors; and\n\u2022\nfactors relating to competitors.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and could in the future continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations.", "PERMNO": 40416, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "AVP"}
