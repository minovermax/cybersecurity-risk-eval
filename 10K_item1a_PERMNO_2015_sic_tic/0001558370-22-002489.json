RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page ii of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The following summary highlights some of the risks you should consider with respect to our business and prospects. This summary is not complete and the risks summarized below are not the only risks we face. You should review and carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in more detail below, which includes a more complete discussion of these risks.\n\u25cf We have incurred annual losses since we were formed and expect to incur losses in the future. We cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u25cf Our quarterly and annual operating results and cash flows have fluctuated in the past and might continue to fluctuate, causing the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\n\u25cf If our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Sales of our assay for the neurological biomarker Nf-L and other neurological assays have become increasingly important to our business, and any significant decrease in sales of such assays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf Epidemic diseases, such as COVID-19 and its variants, could negatively affect various aspects of our business, make it more difficult to meet our obligations to our customers, and result in reduced demand from our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u25cf Our long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and introduce and market new products successfully.\n\u25cf Undetected errors or defects in our products could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products or expose us to product liability claims.\n\u25cf We may seek to enter into strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties, but we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining such arrangements.\n\u25cf We expect to generate a substantial portion of our revenue internationally in the future and can become further subject to various risks relating to our international activities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf We rely on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply our Simoa HD instruments and rely on a different single contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply our Simoa SR-X. If either of these manufacturers should fail to perform, or not perform satisfactorily, our ability to supply these instruments would be negatively and adversely affected.\n\u25cf We rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, one supplier, for some of our materials and components used in our consumable products and our SP-X instrument, and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\n\u25cf If the FDA determines that our products are medical devices or if we seek to market our products for clinical diagnostic or health screening use, we will be required to obtain regulatory clearance(s) or approval(s) and may be required to cease or limit sales of our then marketed products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such regulatory process would be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.\n\u25cf We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in connection with the EUAs that we have received from the FDA for our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or if the FDA otherwise determines that the conditions no longer warrant such authorization, we will be unable to market these products pursuant to this authorization and our business may be harmed.\n\u25cf If we do not comply with governmental regulations applicable to our CLIA-certified laboratory, we may not be able to continue our operations.\n\u25cf If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, it may reduce our ability to maintain any technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and potential competitors, and our business may be harmed.\n\u25cf If we or any of our partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could materially, negatively affect our business.\n\u25cf Our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred annual losses since we were formed and expect to incur losses in the future. We cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $57.7 million, $31.5 million, and $40.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $305.5 million. We\ncannot predict if we will achieve sustained profitability in the near future or at all. We expect that our losses will continue at least through the next 24 months as we plan to continue to invest significant funds toward expansion of our commercial organization and the development of our technology. In addition, as a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. These expenses make it harder for us to achieve and sustain future profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the market acceptance of our products, competitive products, future product development and our market penetration and margins.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and cash flows have fluctuated in the past and might continue to fluctuate, causing the value of our common stock to decline substantially.\nNumerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. These fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting difficult. In addition, these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of such factors may cause our revenue or operating expenses in one period to be disproportionately higher or lower relative to the others. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis might not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as indicative of our future performance. Moreover, our stock price might be based on expectations of future performance that are unrealistic or that we might not meet and, if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate revenue growth or do not successfully manage such growth, our business and growth prospects will be harmed.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in a short period of time. We may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods. Investors should not rely on our operating results for any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance. To effectively manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to maintain and enhance our financial, accounting, manufacturing, customer support and sales administration systems, processes and controls. Failure to effectively manage our anticipated growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development, operational, and administrative infrastructure; result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, or controls; give rise to operational mistakes, losses, loss of customers, productivity or business opportunities; and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.\nOur continued growth could require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. As we commercialize additional products , we may need to incorporate new equipment, implement new technology systems, or hire new personnel with different qualifications. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result in turnaround time delays, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service, and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products, and could damage our reputation and the prospects for our business.\nIf our management is unable to effectively manage our anticipated growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy. In addition, the quality of our products and services may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, together with our cash generated from commercial sales, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. However, our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf continued market acceptance of our products and the ability of our products to meet our customers\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf potential opportunities to strategically acquire companies or technologies that may be complementary to our business;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf the cost of our research and development activities;\n\u25cf our ability to enter into collaborations in the future, and the success of any such collaborations;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of potential regulatory clearances or approvals that may be required in the future for our products; and\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or equity financing may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and business.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss (NOLs) carryforwards to offset future taxable income of approximately $267.2 million, which begin to expire in 2026. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have already experienced ownership changes as defined under Section 382 of the Code. Depending on the timing of any future utilization of our NOLs, we may be limited as to the amount that can be utilized each year as a result of such previous ownership changes. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nU.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of tax reform policies could materially impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nLimitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of future foreign earnings. Should the scale of our international business activities expand, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our future financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized and accepted by our customers and potential customers as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Continued market acceptance of our Simoa\ntechnology platform and products will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other available technologies. Historically, a significant part of our sales and marketing efforts has been directed at demonstrating the advantages of our technology to industry leaders and encouraging such leaders to publish or present the results of their evaluation of our system. We also need to demonstrate to current and prospective customers that our products can help them accomplish their objectives in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we are unable to continue to motivate leading researchers to use Simoa technology, or if such researchers are unable to achieve or unwilling to publish or present significant experimental results using our systems, acceptance and adoption of our systems may be slowed and our ability to increase our revenue would be adversely affected.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base and attract new customers.\nOur success will depend upon our ability to respond to the evolving needs of, and increase our market share among, existing customers and adding new customers. Identifying, engaging and marketing to customers requires substantial time, expertise and expense and involves a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf our ability to attract, retain and manage the sales, marketing and service personnel necessary to expand market acceptance for our Simoa technology platforms;\n\u25cf the time and cost of maintaining and growing a specialized sales, marketing and service force; and\n\u25cf our sales, marketing and service force may be unable to accomplish their goals.\nWe have utilized third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support in certain regions of the world. When we enter into such arrangements, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Any failure of our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales and distribution partners, would adversely affect our business.\nSales of our assay for the neurological biomarker Nf-L and other neurological assays have become increasingly important to our business, and any significant decrease in sales of such assays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNeurology has been one of our primary focus areas for commercialization of our Simoa technology and the services that we provide to our customers. Sales from neurological-related biomarkers, Nf-L in particular, have become an increasingly important part of our business. There can be no assurance that we will continue to derive meaningful revenues from the sale of our neurological products, from services related to neurodegenerative conditions or from sales of instruments driven by customers desiring access to our technology for work relating to neurological conditions. The adoption by our customers of competitive technologies for detecting biomarkers of neurodegenerative conditions could negatively impact our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEpidemic diseases, such as COVID-19 and its variants, could negatively affect various aspects of our business, make it more difficult to meet our obligations to our customers, and result in reduced demand from our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants. Potential impacts to our business include disruptions to or restrictions on our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 ability to travel, temporary closures of the facilities of our suppliers or customers, delays in installation of instruments, and delays in shipments to and from affected countries. Any such travel restrictions and business closures could adversely impact our operations locally and worldwide, including our ability to manufacture, sell or distribute our products, as well as cause temporary closures of our foreign distributors, or the facilities of suppliers or customers. Any material disruption of our employees, distributors, suppliers or customers in impacted countries could impact our global\nsales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results.\nThe sales cycle for our Simoa instruments can be lengthy and variable, which makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and other operating results.\nThe sales process for our Simoa instruments generally involves numerous interactions with multiple individuals within an organization, and often includes in-depth analysis by potential customers of our technology and products and a lengthy review process. Our customers\u2019 evaluation processes often involve a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these factors, the capital investment required to purchase our systems, and the budget cycles of our customers, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order can vary significantly. Given the length and uncertainty of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, fluctuations in our sales on a period-to-period basis. In addition, any failure to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing systems, using existing assays not requiring capital equipment, or purchasing systems other than ours.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and introduce and market new products successfully.\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing Simoa products and our development of new products utilizing Simoa or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing products, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products will achieve, if any. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new products in the future. In addition, introducing new products could result in a decrease in revenues from our existing products. Consistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements, we expect to continue to use a substantial amount of capital for product research and development. We may need more capital for product research and development than is available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer.\nUndetected errors or defects in our products could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products or expose us to product liability claims.\nOur Simoa products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions or new products are released. Disruptions affecting the introduction or release of, or other performance problems with, our products may damage our customers\u2019 businesses and could harm their and our reputation. If that occurs, we may incur significant costs, the attention of our key personnel could be diverted, or other significant customer relations problems may arise. We may also be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our products. In addition, if we do not meet industry or quality standards, if applicable, our products may be subject to recall. A material liability claim, recall or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products could harm our business and operating results.\nAlthough we do not, and cannot currently, promote the use of our products, or services based on our products, for diagnostic purposes, if our customers develop or use them for diagnostic purposes, someone could file a product liability claim alleging that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in the failure to adequately perform, leading to death or injury. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition. We cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would adequately protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may seek to enter into additional strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties, but we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining such arrangements.\nWe may seek to enter into additional strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties to develop products based on our Simoa technology, such as for certain in vitro diagnostics, or IVD, purposes. However, we may not be successful in doing so. Establishing collaborations and licensing arrangements is difficult and time-consuming, and discussions may not lead to collaborations or licenses on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we establish such relationships, such as our license agreement with Abbott, if our partners do not prioritize and commit sufficient resources to develop and sell products based on our Simoa technology, they may never result in the successful development or commercialization of products based on our Simoa technology.\nOur reliance on distributors for sales of our products outside of the United States could limit or prevent us from selling our products and could impact our revenue.\nWe have established exclusive distribution agreements for our Simoa instruments and related consumable products within certain foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, India, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and UAE. We intend to continue to grow our business internationally, and to do so we must attract additional distributors and retain existing distributors to maximize the commercial opportunity for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting or retaining desirable sales and distribution partners or that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations or may choose to favor marketing the products of our competitors. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to enter into effective arrangements with distributors in particular geographic areas, we may not realize long-term international revenue growth. In addition, if our distributors fail to comply with applicable laws and ethical standards, including anti-bribery laws, this could damage our reputation and could have a significant adverse effect on our business and our revenues.\nWe expect to generate a substantial portion of our revenue internationally in the future and can become further subject to various risks relating to our international activities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 36%, 31% and 41%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers located outside of North America. We believe that a substantial percentage of our future revenue will continue to come from international sources as we expand our overseas operations and develop opportunities in additional areas. We have limited experience operating internationally and engaging in international business involves a number of difficulties and risks, including:\n\u25cf required compliance with existing and changing U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u25cf difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf a shortage of high-quality salespeople and distributors;\n\u25cf pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and in defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us or any of our distributors, suppliers or collaborators;\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf required compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, data privacy requirements, such as the GDPR, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;\n\u25cf export or import restrictions and supply chain disruptions;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf the imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;\n\u25cf the impact of political and economic instability and conflict, such as the tension in Russia and Ukraine, which could lead to uncertainty and instability in global financial markets;\n\u25cf scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u25cf the imposition of new trade restrictions; and\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers.\nHistorically, most of our revenue has been denominated in U.S. dollars. In the future, we may sell our products and services in local currency outside of the United States. As our operations in countries outside of the United States grow, our results of operations and cash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could harm our business in the future. For example, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, in the absence of a corresponding change in local currency prices, our revenue could be adversely affected as we convert revenue from local currencies to U.S. dollars. If we dedicate significant resources to our international operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition will suffer.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws by us or our agents.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. Our reliance on independent distributors to sell our products internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents, and we could be held responsible for their actions. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with these individuals. We are also subject to similar antibribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. We have limited experience in complying with these laws and in developing procedures to monitor compliance with these laws by our agents. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these\nlaws or the interpretation thereof. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We could also incur severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures.\nWe rely on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply our Simoa HD-X instrument and rely on a different single contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply our Simoa SR-X instrument. If either of these manufacturers should fail or not perform satisfactorily, our ability to supply these instruments would be negatively and adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on a single contract manufacturer, STRATEC, an analytical and diagnostic systems manufacturer located in Germany, to manufacture and supply all of our Simoa HD-X instruments. In addition, we currently rely on a single contract manufacturer, Paramit, a contract manufacturer located in California, to manufacture and supply all of our SR-X instruments. Since our contract with STRATEC does not commit them to supply quantities beyond the amounts included in our forecasts and our contract with Paramit does not commit them to carry inventory or make available any particular quantities, these contract manufacturers may give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours, and we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. If either of these manufacturers were not able to supply instruments, our business would be harmed.\nIn the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for the HD-X instrument or the SR-X, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so as a result of identifying and entering into an agreement with a new supplier as well as preparing such new supplier to meet the logistical requirements associated with manufacturing our units, and our business would suffer. We may also experience additional costs and delays in the event we need access to or rights under any intellectual property of STRATEC.\nIn addition, certain of the components used in our instruments are sourced by these manufacturers from limited or sole suppliers. If they were to lose such suppliers, there can be no assurance that they would be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all. An interruption in our ability to sell and deliver instruments to customers could occur if our manufacturers encounter delays or difficulties in securing these components, or if the quality of the components supplied do not meet specifications, or if they cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. If any of these events occur, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, one supplier, for some of our materials and components used in our consumable products and our SP-X instrument, and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe rely on limited or sole suppliers for certain reagents and other materials and components that are used in our consumable products and in our SP-X instrument. While we have long-term contracts with some critical suppliers, we do not have contracts with all suppliers and instead rely on periodically forecasting our needs for such materials and entering into standard purchase orders with them. In addition, our use of many of the materials used in our consumable products is limited to research use only. As we expand into diagnostic applications for our products, we will need to secure diagnostic rights to such materials. If we were to lose suppliers or were unable to secure required rights for materials from suppliers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, if at all. An interruption in our operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these materials or any required rights to these materials, if the quality of the materials supplied do not meet our requirements, or if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. The time and effort required to qualify a new supplier and ensure that the new materials provide the same or better quality results could result in significant additional costs. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIncreased demand may cause us to experience delays in production or backlogs in deliveries that could limit the growth of our revenue or increase our losses.\nA significant unforecasted increase in demand for our products may result in delays or shortfalls in our production and backlogs in deliveries. If we are unable to keep up with demand for our products, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 products. Our inability to successfully manufacture our products would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe life sciences research and diagnostic markets are highly competitive. If we fail to effectively compete, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nWe face significant competition in the life sciences research and diagnostic markets. We currently compete with both established and early-stage companies that design, manufacture and market systems and consumable supplies. Many of our current competitors have competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u25cf greater name and brand recognition;\n\u25cf substantially greater financial and human resources;\n\u25cf broader product lines;\n\u25cf larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;\n\u25cf substantial intellectual property portfolios;\n\u25cf larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and\n\u25cf better established, larger scale, and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and technologies introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, we cannot assure you that our competitors do not have or will not develop products or technologies that currently or in the future will enable them to produce competitive products with greater capabilities or at lower costs than ours. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntegrating any business, product or technology we acquire can be expensive and time-consuming and can disrupt and adversely affect our ongoing business, including product sales, and distract our management.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies as well as pursue strategic alliances, joint ventures, technology licenses or investments in complementary businesses, such as our 2018 acquisition of Aushon and our 2019 acquisition of Uman. Our ability to successfully integrate any business, product or technology we acquire depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u25cf minimize the disruption and distraction of our management and other employees, including our sales force, in connection with the integration of any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u25cf minimize disruption in relationships with customers, distributors or suppliers as a result of such a transaction;\n\u25cf avoid acquisition of unanticipated liabilities related to acquired companies;\n\u25cf maintain and increase sales of our existing products;\n\u25cf establish or manage the transition of the manufacture and supply of any acquired product;\n\u25cf identify and add the necessary sales, marketing, manufacturing, regulatory and other related personnel, capabilities and infrastructure that are required to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u25cf manage the transition and migration of acquired personnel and all commercial, financial, legal, regulatory and other pertinent information relating to any acquired business, product or technology;\n\u25cf comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to any acquired business, product or technology; and\n\u25cf maintain and extend intellectual property protection for any acquired product or technology.\nIf we are unable to perform the above functions or otherwise effectively integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\nForeign acquisitions (such as our acquisition of Uman) involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of any acquisition may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future joint ventures or acquisitions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Diagnostic Product Reimbursement\nIf the FDA determines that our products are medical devices or if we seek to market our products for clinical diagnostic or health screening use, we will be required to obtain regulatory clearance(s) or approval(s) and may be required to cease or limit sales of our then marketed products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such regulatory process would be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.\nWe have focused initially on the life sciences research market. This includes offering products for use by laboratories associated with academic and governmental research institutions, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research companies. Accordingly, other than our COVID assays for which we have received EUAs, our products are labeled as \u201cResearch Use Only\u201d and are not intended for diagnostic uses. While we have focused initially on the life sciences research market and RUO products only, our future strategy includes expanding our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. Such IVD products, once developed and offered, will be subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable international agencies, as medical devices including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we or our collaborators may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In general, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or is the subject of an approved PMA, unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other\npre-amendment, 510(k)-exempt, 510(k) cleared products, or PMA-approved products that have subsequently been down-classified. If the FDA determines that the device is not \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for a direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.\nHigh risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products internationally for such uses, we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we may rely significantly on our foreign independent distributors or collaborators to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries.\nIf we or our collaborators are required to obtain a PMA or 510(k) clearance for products based on our technology, we or they would be subject to a substantial number of additional requirements for medical devices, including establishment registration, device listing, Quality Systems Regulations (QSRs), which cover the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, servicing, sterilization (if required), and storage and shipping of medical devices (among other activities), product labeling, advertising, recordkeeping, post-market surveillance, post-approval studies, adverse event reporting, and correction and removal (recall) regulations. One or more of the products we or a collaborator may develop using our technology may also require clinical trials in order to generate the data required for a PMA. Complying with these requirements may be time-consuming and expensive. We or our collaborators may be required to expend significant resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the FDA regulations and/or take satisfactory corrective action in response to enforcement action, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability to design, develop, and commercialize products using our technology as planned. Failure to comply with these requirements may subject us or a collaborator to a range of enforcement actions, such as warning letters, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, criminal prosecution, recall and/or seizure of products, and revocation of marketing authorization, as well as significant adverse publicity. If we or our collaborators fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for IVD products, such products may not be able to be launched or successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all.\nLDTs are a subset of IVD tests that are designed, manufactured and offered as services by high complexity clinical laboratories and used within a single laboratory. The FDA maintains that LDTs are medical devices and has for the most part exercised enforcement discretion for most LDTs. A significant change in the way that the FDA regulates any LDTs that we, our collaborators or our customers develop using our technology could affect our business. The FDA has considered the appropriate way to regulate such tests, but after publishing several draft guidances and holding a number of public hearings and workshops, no final guidance has been issued. However, if the FDA requires laboratories to undergo premarket review and comply with other applicable FDA requirements in the future, the cost and time required to commercialize an LDT will increase substantially, and may reduce the financial incentive for laboratories to develop LDTs, which could reduce demand for our instruments and our other products.\nForeign jurisdictions have laws and regulations similar to those described above, which may adversely affect our ability to market our products as planned in such countries. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. As in the United States, the cost and time required to comply with regulatory requirements may be substantial, and there is no guarantee that we will obtain the necessary authorization(s) required to make our products commercially viable. As a result, the imposition of foreign requirements may also have a material adverse effect on the commercial viability of our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in connection with the EUAs that we have received from the FDA for our COVID-19 antibody and antigen tests. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or if the FDA otherwise determines that the conditions no longer warrant such authorization, we will be unable to market these products pursuant to this authorization and our business may be harmed.\nWe have received EUAs from the FDA authorizing us to market our Simoa Semi-Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody Test and our Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N Protein Antigen Test, each of which is run on our HD-X instrument. These EUAs allow us to market and sell these products without the need to obtain premarket clearance or approval under the FDA\u2019s standard review pathways for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA has also established certain conditions which must be met in order to maintain authorization under these EUAs. The requirements can be unclear and are subject to change.\nThe FDA has the authority to issue an EUA during a public health emergency if it determines, based on the totality of the scientific evidence, that it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective, that the known and potential benefits of a product outweigh the known and potential risks, that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative, and if certain other regulatory criteria are met. These standards for marketing authorization are lower than if the FDA had reviewed these tests under its traditional marketing authorization pathways, and we cannot assure you that our tests would be cleared or approved under those more extensive clearance and approval standards. Moreover, the FDA\u2019s policies regarding EUAs can change unexpectedly, and the FDA may revoke an EUA when it determines that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization or if problems are identified with the authorized product. We cannot predict how long our authorizations will remain in place. FDA policies regarding diagnostic tests, therapies and other products used to diagnose, treat or mitigate COVID-19 remain in flux as the FDA responds to new and evolving public health information and clinical evidence. Changes to FDA regulations or requirements could require changes to our authorized tests, necessitate additional measures or make it impractical or impossible for us to market our tests at all.\nIn addition, even though we have received these EUAs, these tests may not gain broad market acceptance among customers, including physicians, healthcare payors, users and others in the medical community. The commercial success of our COVID-19 tests will initially be dependent upon physicians and healthcare providers adopting our test kits, which will be informed, in part, by the convenience and accuracy of our tests. Furthermore, the COVID-19 diagnostic testing market is susceptible to rapid technological developments and we may not be able to match new technological advances, which might render our COVID-19 test kits uncompetitive or obsolete. If we are unable to match technological improvements in competitive products or effectively respond to the needs of our customers and users, the demand for our COVID-19 test kits could be reduced.\nThe termination of the emergency conditions under which EUAs are permitted, the rescission of an EUA, the failure of our tests to gain market acceptance or our inability to match advances in competing products could adversely impact our business.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products, including RUO products, in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our\nreputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nU.S. legislative, FDA or global regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain any required regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nMoreover, leadership, personnel and structural changes within the FDA as well as recent and future federal election outcomes could result in significant legislative and regulatory reforms impacting the FDA\u2019s regulation of our products. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIn addition, the EU recently published new regulations that will result in greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. The new IVD regulation (new IVD Regulation) is significantly different from the European directive for In vitro diagnostic products (IVD Directive) that it replaces in that it will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, include a risk-based classification system and increase the requirements for conformity assessment. The CE registration for Uman\u2019s Nf-L ELISA assay kit for CSF was approved in March 2014 under the IVD Directive. Under the IVD Directive the assay is classified as a general IVD product, class I and required self-certification with no involvement of a notified body/authority. Under the new IVD Regulation, the requirements increase and involve assessment by a notified body for class B, C and D products. Uman\u2019s Nf-L ELISA assay kit for CSF is classified as class B product and must fully implement the new IVD Regulation by May 2027. The new requirements include an ISO 13485 certification of the quality system (which Uman received July 2018) and increased technical evidence and follow-up of performance of the specific product (e.g. clinical evidence and post-market activities). The work to meet the new technical requirements is on-going. An internal GAP-analysis is to be performed and work to eliminate the GAPs performed.\nIn order to continue to sell our products in Europe, we must maintain our CE marks and continue to comply with certain EU directives and, in the future with the new IVD Regulation. Our failure to continue to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including those administered by authorities of the EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity by our notified body, which could impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future. Any changes to the membership of the European Union, such as the departure of the United Kingdom (Brexit), may impact the regulatory requirements for the impacted countries and impair our business operations and our ability to market products in such countries.\nIf we do not comply with governmental regulations applicable to our CLIA-certified laboratory, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe operation of our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory is subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States. This laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of compliance and is licensed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Maryland, and we may obtain other state licenses if required in the future. Failure to comply with federal or state regulations or changes in those regulatory requirements could result in a substantial curtailment or even prohibition of the operations of our laboratory and could have an adverse effect on our business. CLIA is a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories\nthat perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. To maintain CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of these laboratories. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or any required state licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect to rely on third parties in conducting any required future studies of diagnostic products that may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials or other studies that may be required to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearance or approval for future diagnostic products. Accordingly, we expect that we would rely on third parties, such as clinical investigators, consultants, and collaborators to conduct such studies if needed. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical and other development activities would reduce our control over these activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval.\nIf diagnostic procedures that are enabled by our technology are subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, our business could be harmed.\nThe ability of us, our customers or our collaborators to commercialize diagnostic tests based on our technology will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these tests will be available from government health programs, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new technologies are often made by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Private payors often follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of payments for particular products and procedures. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any diagnostic tests based on our technology, and, if coverage is available, the level of payments. Reimbursement may impact the demand for those tests. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, any tests for which marketing authorization is received may not be able to be successfully commercialized.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize any products based on our technology and affect the prices that may be obtained.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, became law. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Both Congress and former President Trump expressed their intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or were effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or our collaborators will receive for any cleared or approved product. Any reduction in payments from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any of our products for which we receive marketing approval.\nIn addition, sales of our tests outside of the United States will subject us to foreign regulatory requirements, which may also change over time.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The expansion in government\u2019s effect on the United States healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements by payors for our products or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems to operate our business. We have installed, and expect to expand, a number of enterprise software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas, including, for example, systems handling human resources, accounting, manufacturing, inventory control, financial controls and reporting, sales administration, and other infrastructure operations. In addition to the aforementioned business systems, we intend to extend the capabilities of both our preventative and detective security controls by augmenting the monitoring and alerting functions, network design, and automatic countermeasure operations of our technical systems. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including manufacturing operations, quality control, customer service support, and general administrative activities.\nInformation technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology and telecommunications systems, failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or those used by our third-party suppliers could prevent us from operating our business and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, and intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our customers. This data encompasses a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information: loss of access; inappropriate disclosure; inappropriate modification; and inadequate monitoring of our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses, breaches, interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other persons into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information systems, commit identity theft or carry out other unauthorized or illegal activities. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We engage third-party vendors and service providers to store and otherwise process some of our data,\nincluding sensitive and personal information. Our vendors and service providers may also be the targets of the risks described above, including cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and fraud. Our ability to monitor our vendors and service providers\u2019 data security is limited, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures, resulting in the unauthorized access to, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our data, including sensitive and personal information, and disruption of our or third-party service providers\u2019 systems. We and our third-party service providers may face difficulties in identifying, or promptly responding to, potential security breaches and other instances of unauthorized access to, or disclosure or other loss of, information. Any hacking or other attack on our or our third-party service providers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 systems, and any unauthorized access to, or disclosure or other loss of, information suffered by us or our third-party service providers or vendors, or the perception that any of these have occurred, could result in legal claims or proceedings, loss of intellectual property, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, negative publicity, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Moreover, we may need to increase our efforts to train our personnel to detect and defend against cyber- or phishing-attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and we may need to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of potential security breaches, which could cause us to incur significant additional expenses.\nAny such security breach or interruption, as well as any action by us or our employees or contractors that might be inconsistent with the rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations applicable within the United States and elsewhere where we conduct business, could result in enforcement actions by U.S. states, the U.S. federal government or foreign governments, liability or sanctions under data privacy laws that protect personally identifiable information, regulatory penalties, other legal proceedings such as but not limited to private litigation, the incurrence of significant remediation costs, disruptions to our development programs, business operations and collaborations, diversion of management efforts and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business and operations. Because of the rapidly moving nature of technology and the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, our measures to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks may be unsuccessful.\nIn addition, our insurance may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from cyber-attacks, breaches, or other interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nThe failure to maintain our current enterprise resource planning system (ERP) could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf our ERP system does not continue to operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. Significant delays in documenting, reviewing, and testing our internal control could cause us to fail to comply with our SEC reporting obligations related to our management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are currently subject to, and may in the future become subject to additional, U.S. federal and state laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our future customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we currently, and in the future will, collect, store, transfer, use or process sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of employees, and intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves and other parties. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy. We are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement\npractices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn the United States, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. In November 2020, California also passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations and granting additional rights to consumers. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado both passed comprehensive state data privacy laws. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in the U.S. Congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted. These and future laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\nFurthermore, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (known as \u201cprotected health information\u201d) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to changing interpretation. Although we take measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, manipulated, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, breach or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under federal or state laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and regulatory penalties. Notice of breaches must be made to affected individuals, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the media or State Attorneys General. Such a notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the GDPR in 2016 to replace the current European Union Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States, enhances enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. While we have taken steps to comply with the GDPR, including such as reviewing our security procedures and entering into data processing agreements with relevant contractors, we cannot assure you that our efforts to remain in compliance will be fully successful.\nFurther, unauthorized access, loss or dissemination of sensitive information could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our products could be delayed.\nWe face risks related to handling of hazardous materials and other regulations governing environmental safety.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental, health, safety and other governmental laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce. Our activities that are subject to these regulations include, among other things, our use of hazardous materials and the generation, transportation and storage of waste. Although we have secured clearance from the EPA historically, and currently are operating in compliance with applicable EPA rules and regulations, our business could be adversely affected if we discover that we or an acquired business is not in material compliance with these rules and regulations. In the future, we may pursue the use of other surfactant substances that will require clearance from the EPA, and we may fail to obtain such clearance. Existing laws and regulations may also be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us, whether retroactively or prospectively, that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. It is also impossible to eliminate completely the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury to individuals. In such an event, we could be liable for any damages that result, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, it may reduce our ability to maintain any technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and potential competitors, and our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe cannot assure investors that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted. It is possible that, for any of our patents that have granted or that may grant in the future, others will design around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to us or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable. We cannot guarantee investors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or to such patents being interpreted narrowly or otherwise in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage over our products and protection against our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable\nor may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third party, our rights in and to certain intellectual property could be undermined. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time-consuming, the outcome would be unpredictable, and any remedy may be inadequate. In addition, courts outside of the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets.\nSome of our owned and in-licensed intellectual property has been discovered through government-funded programs and thus is subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements, and a preference for U.S. industry. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, subject us to expenditure of resources with respect to reporting requirements, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights we own and have in-licensed have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations. For example, some of the issued U.S. patents we own and all of the intellectual property rights licensed to us under our license agreement with Tufts have been generated using U.S. government funds. As a result, the U.S. government has certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future products pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (the Bayh-Dole Act). These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if the government determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail, or the applicable licensor fails, to disclose the invention to the government, elect title, and file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. In addition, the U.S. government may acquire title to these inventions in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us, or the applicable licensor, to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturing may limit our ability to license the applicable patent rights on an exclusive basis under certain circumstances.\nIf we enter into future arrangements involving government funding, and we make inventions as a result of such funding, intellectual property rights to such discoveries may be subject to the applicable provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply. Any exercise by the government of certain of its rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur Simoa bead-based technology is licensed to us by Tufts University. Any loss of our rights to this technology could prevent us from selling our products.\nOur Simoa bead-based technology is licensed exclusively to us from Tufts University. We do not own the patents that underlie this license. Our rights to use this technology and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to the continuation of and compliance with the terms of the license. Our principal obligations under our license agreement with Tufts are as follows:\n\u25cf royalty payments;\n\u25cf milestone payments;\n\u25cf annual maintenance fees;\n\u25cf using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and sell a product using the licensed technology and developing a market for such product;\n\u25cf paying and/or reimbursing fees related to prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of patent rights; and\n\u25cf providing certain reports.\nIf we breach any of these obligations, Tufts may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in our being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products using our Simoa bead-based technology or a competitor\u2019s gaining access to the Simoa technology. Termination of our license agreement with Tufts would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we are a party to a number of other agreements that include licenses to intellectual property, including non-exclusive licenses. We expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our business could suffer, for example, if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms.\nWe may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our current or future products, and we cannot provide any assurances that we would be able to do so.\nWe may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our current or future products, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. If we could not obtain a license, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nLicensing of intellectual property involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain the licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product, or the dispute may have an adverse effect on our results of operation.\nIn addition to agreements pursuant to which we in-license intellectual property, we have in the past and expect to in the future to grant licenses under our intellectual property. Like in-licenses, out-licenses are complex, and disputes may arise between us and our licensees. Moreover, our licensees may breach their obligations, or we may be exposed to liability due to our failure or alleged failure to satisfy our obligations. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we or any of our partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and perform our services without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and\npending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products and services. As part of a business strategy to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets, competitors have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our products and/or services infringe their intellectual property rights and have suggested, and may suggest in the future, that we enter into license agreements. Any such claims made to date are, we believe, without merit.\nEven if such claims are without merit, we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of infringement made by third parties or settling such claims. Any adverse ruling by a court or administrative body, or perception of an adverse ruling, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and our finances. Moreover, third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us, which could block our ability to offer one or more products or services and could result in a substantial award of damages against us. In addition, since we sometimes indemnify customers, collaborators or licensees, we may have additional liability in connection with any infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, some of which are unknown to us, that may result in issued patents upon which our products or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or incorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed by our technology or any of our products. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in our industry. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, customers or collaboration partners infringe upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u25cf seek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf abandon any infringing product or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages including, in an exceptional case, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes upon or violates the third-party\u2019s rights;\n\u25cf pay substantial royalties or fees or grant cross-licenses to our technology; or\n\u25cf defend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents that we license. In the event of infringement or unauthorized use, we may file one or more infringement lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. An adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and it could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMany of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise any funds necessary to continue our operations, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our products to market.\nIn addition, patent litigation can be very costly and time-consuming. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or any of our future development partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we or any of our partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or services, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement, or failure to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO even outside of the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could materially, negatively affect our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on current and future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside of the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that federal and state laws do in the United States. Consequently, regardless of whether we are able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in the United States, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside of the United States, or from selling or importing products made by using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as it is in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Even if we pursue and obtain issued patents in particular jurisdictions, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent third parties from competing. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license and may adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we and our partners also face the risk that our products are imported or reimported into markets with relatively higher prices from markets with relatively lower prices, which would result in a decrease of sales and any payments we receive from the affected market. Recent developments in U.S. patent law have made it more difficult to stop these and related practices based on theories of patent infringement.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nThe America Invents Act (the AIA) was signed into law on September 16, 2011, and many of the substantive changes became effective on March 16, 2013. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to the filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patent holder may file a patent infringement suit and provide additional opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our owned and in-licensed U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings, compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, such as Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe use third-party software that may be difficult to replace or may cause errors or failures of our products that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation.\nWe use software licensed from third parties in our products. In the future, this software may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this software could result in delays in the production of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, any errors or defects in third-party software or other third-party software failures could result in errors, defects or cause our products to fail, which could harm our business and be costly to correct. Many of these providers attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, defects or failures, and if enforceable, we may have additional liability to our customers or third-party providers that could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.\nWe will need to maintain our relationships with third-party software providers and to obtain software from such providers that does not contain any errors or defects. Any failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to deliver reliable products to our customers and could harm our reputation and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Being a Public Company\nWe expect that our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of new products, significant contracts, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, acquisitions, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u25cf competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may provide to the public;\n\u25cf issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or recommendations for our stock;\n\u25cf positive or adverse regulatory announcements;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf conditions in our markets;\n\u25cf manufacturing disputes or delays;\n\u25cf any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf any change to the composition of our board of directors or key personnel;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets;\n\u25cf share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts; and\n\u25cf other factors described in this Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and life science companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have on occasion instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about our company, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the public markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from an investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, restated by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u25cf authorizing our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our board of directors may determine;\n\u25cf specifying that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors and that our stockholders may not act by written consent;\n\u25cf establishing an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf providing that directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u25cf providing that our board of directors may create new directorships and that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u25cf establishing that our board of directors is divided into three classes-Class I, Class II, and Class III-with each class serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf providing that our board of directors may amend our restated by-laws without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf requiring a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our restated certificate of incorporation, restated by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe incur increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These costs increase our net loss. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, as a public company we incur additional costs and obligations in order to comply with SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under these rules, we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve timely compliance with Section 404, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. The process of obtaining the attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm is costly and requires the devotion of significant management attention and resources. We have been required to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are designed and operating effectively, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 17155, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "QTRX"}
