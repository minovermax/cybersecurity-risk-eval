Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should consider the factors described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our stock. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. The risks contained in this Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. The trading price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic-Related Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our business and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue creating extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. The pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade, supply chains, and the labor market. During the past two years, governments, businesses, and the public are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. At present, most restrictions on movement have been lifted and widely available vaccines\nhave proved to be effective in preventing serious illness and death from the novel coronavirus; however, the emergence of new variants of the virus have impeded the ability to fully resolve the public health risk and, as such, disruption of typical social and economic conditions persists. The scope, duration, and full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not fully known. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress, recession or depression, they could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways related to credit, collateral, customer demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk, and human capital, as described in more detail below.\nCredit Risk. Our risks of timely loan repayment and the value of collateral supporting the loans are affected by the strength of our borrowers' businesses. The continuation of the COVID-19 public health crisis has caused and may continue to cause constraint on commercial activity and financial transactions. At present, labor shortages and supply chain interruptions continue to present obstacles to economic recovery and have contributed to inflationary conditions. These conditions have and are expected to continue to result in overall economic and financial market instability and affect businesses' profitability and individual purchasing power, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. In the event our allowance for credit losses is insufficient to cover such losses, our earnings, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nIn an effort to support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under the CARES Act whereby loans to small businesses are originated. These loans require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time and also limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, if the terms of the program change, or if the SBA determines there is a deficiency in the manner in which any PPP loans were originated, funded or serviced by the Company, we may be subject to repayment risk as well as the heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit.\nStrategic Risk. Our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by a variety of external factors that may affect the price or marketability of our products and services, changes in interest rates that may increase our funding costs, reduced demand for our financial products due to economic conditions and the various responses of governmental and nongovernmental authorities to economic instability. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, contributed to labor shortages, and has led to severe disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, which may impact our ability to effect our strategic priorities, including strategies relating to organic growth and bank acquisitions. Furthermore, many of the governmental actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions to temporarily close or restrict the operations of certain businesses, and these restrictions could recur if there are future increases in the spread of the virus.\nOperational Risk. We rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information technology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely to ensure that our operations continue uninterrupted as much as possible. Nonetheless, technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include the risks of greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nInterest Rate Risk. Our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability have been and may continue to be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on markets and stress in the energy sector. A prolonged period of extremely\nvolatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Further, increasing interest rates can have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates, or a prolonged period of low interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition.\nBecause there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in similar global impact, we do not yet know the full extent and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future developments will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis has and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risk. Legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. Furthermore, since the inception of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. In addition, some banks have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. The Company and the Bank are exposed to similar litigation risk and negative media attention risk, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP, or litigation from agents with respect to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or negative media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PPP has also attracted interest from federal and state enforcement authorities, oversight agencies, regulators and Congressional committees. State Attorneys General and other federal and state agencies may assert that they are not subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and the PPP regulations entitling the Bank to rely on borrower certifications, and they may take more aggressive actions against the Bank for alleged violations of the provisions governing the Bank\u2019s participation in the PPP. Federal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nCredit Risk\nLending goals may not be attainable.\nFuture demand for additional lending is unclear and uncertain, and opportunities to make loans may be more limited and/or involve risks or terms that we likely would not find acceptable or in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. A failure to meet our lending goals could adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition, liquidity and capital.\nDeterioration in the real estate markets, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, can adversely affect us.\nA correction in residential real estate market prices or reduced levels of home sales, could result in lower single family home values, adversely affecting the liquidity and value of collateral securing commercial loans for residential land acquisition, construction and development, as well as residential mortgage loans and residential property collateral securing loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations and gains on the sale of mortgage loans. Declining real estate prices cause higher delinquencies and losses on certain mortgage loans, generally, and particularly on second lien mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Significant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans can limit the market for and liquidity of most residential mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. Deteriorating trends could occur, including declines in real estate values, home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors. These could have adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect our financial condition, including capital and liquidity, or results of operations. In\nthe event our allowance for credit losses on loans is insufficient to cover such losses, our earnings, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur real estate portfolios are exposed if weakness in the Florida housing market or general economy arises.\nFlorida has historically experienced deeper recessions and more dramatic slowdowns in economic activity than other states and a decline in real estate values in Florida can be significantly larger than the national average. Declines in home prices and the volume of home sales in Florida, along with the reduced availability of certain types of mortgage credit, can result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our portfolios of home equity lines and loans, and commercial loans related to residential real estate acquisition, construction and development. Declines in home prices coupled with high or increased unemployment levels or increased interest rates can cause losses which adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.\nWe are subject to lending concentration risk.\nOur loan portfolio contains several industry and collateral concentrations including, but not limited to, commercial and residential real estate. Due to the exposure in these concentrations, disruptions in markets, economic conditions, including those resulting from the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws or regulations or other events could cause a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. In weak economies, or in areas where real estate market conditions are distressed, we may experience a higher than normal level of nonperforming real estate loans. The collateral value of the portfolio and the revenue stream from those loans could come under stress, and additional provisions for the allowance for credit losses could be necessitated. Our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate at prices at or above the respective carrying values could also be impaired, causing additional losses.\nCommercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) is cyclical and poses risks of loss to us due to our concentration levels and risk of the asset, especially during a difficult economy, including the current stressed economy. As of December 31, 2021, 49% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans secured by commercial real estate. The banking regulators continue to give CRE lending greater scrutiny, and banks with higher levels of CRE loans are expected to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures.\nSeacoast Bank has a CRE concentration risk management program and monitors its exposure to CRE; however, there can be no assurance that the program will be effective in managing our concentration in CRE.\nNonperforming assets could result in an increase in our provision for credit losses on loans, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021, our nonaccrual loans totaled $30.6 million, or 0.52%, of the loan portfolio and our nonperforming assets (which includes nonaccrual loans) were $44.2 million, or 0.46%, of assets. In addition, we had approximately $5.7 million in accruing loans that were 30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2021. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting our income, and increasing our loan administration costs. When the only source of repayment expected is the underlying collateral, we are required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral, if less than the recorded amount of our investment, which may result in a loss. These loans and OREO also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. We may incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming loans. If economic conditions and market factors negatively and/or disproportionately affect some of our larger loans, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and our provision for credit losses on loans. Any increase in our nonperforming assets and related increases in our provision for losses on loans could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial conditions, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our personnel, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be\nno assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future, or that nonperforming assets will not result in losses in the future.\nOur allowance for credit losses on loans may prove inadequate or we may be adversely affected by credit risk exposures.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We review our allowance for credit losses on loans for adequacy, at a minimum quarterly, considering economic conditions and trends, reasonable and supportable forecasts, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. We cannot be certain that our allowance will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, or borrowers repaying their loans. Generally speaking, the credit quality of our borrowers can deteriorate as a result of economic downturns in our markets. If the credit quality of our customer base or their debt service behavior materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers declines or weakness in the real estate markets and other economics were to arise, or if our allowance for credit losses on loans is not adequate, our business, financial condition, including our liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses on loans, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance, which would result in a decrease in net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe must effectively manage our interest rate risk. The impact of changing interest rates on our results is difficult to predict and changes in interest rates may impact our performance in ways we cannot predict.\nOur profitability is largely dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income paid to us on our loans and investments and the interest we pay to third parties such as our depositors, lenders and debt holders. Changes in interest rates can impact our profits and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities. Prolonged periods of unusually low interest rates may have an incrementally adverse effect on our earnings by reducing yields on loans and other earning assets over time. Increases in market interest rates may reduce our customers\u2019 desire to borrow money from us or adversely affect their ability to repay their outstanding loans by increasing their debt service obligations through the periodic reset of adjustable interest rate loans. If our borrowers\u2019 ability to pay their loans is impaired by increasing interest payment obligations, our level of nonperforming assets would increase, producing an adverse effect on operating results. Increases in interest rates can have a material impact on the volume of mortgage originations and re-financings, adversely affecting the profitability of our mortgage finance business. Interest rate risk can also result from mismatches between the dollar amounts of re-pricing or maturing assets and liabilities and from mismatches in the timing and rates at which our assets and liabilities re-price. We actively monitor and manage the balances of our maturing and re-pricing assets and liabilities to reduce the adverse impact of changes in interest rates, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid material adverse effects on our net interest margin in all market conditions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected in the future if economic activity increases and interest rates rise, which may result in our interest expense increasing, and our net interest margin decreasing, if we must offer interest on demand deposits to attract or retain customer deposits.\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to adequately anticipate.\nIn recent years, in response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives. Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Since then the Federal Reserve raised rates nine times during 2015-2018, and reduced rates five times during 2019-2020. Further rate changes reportedly are dependent on the Federal Reserve\u2019s assessment of economic data as it becomes available; however, in December 2021, the Federal Reserve released projections related to the target range for the federal funds rate that imply, while there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur, three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in 2022, followed by three in 2023 and two in 2024. The Company\ncannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, economic, or other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, FDIC insurance assessments, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nWe have traditionally obtained funds through local deposits and thus we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a cheaper and more stable source of funds than other borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders and reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are higher cost time deposits. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if, and to the extent, we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nThe discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and the identification and use of alternative replacement reference rates, could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, and the value of the Company's financial instruments, and may subject the Company to litigation risk.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, which is the administrator of LIBOR, announced its intention to cease the publication of most U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023, extending the previously indicated timeline for the discontinuation of the widely used one-month, three-month, and other USD LIBOR benchmarks.\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of market participants including large U.S. financial institutions, assembled by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was tasked with identifying alternative reference interest rates to replace LIBOR. The Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) has emerged as the ARRC's preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S.-Treasury-backed repurchased transactions. On July 29, 2021, ARCC formally recommended SOFR as its preferred alternative replacement rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from LIBOR is anticipated to be gradual over the coming years. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted, and these reforms may cause benchmark rates to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences, which could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nThe Company's LIBOR transition steering committee is responsible for overseeing the execution of the Company's enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program, and for evaluating and mitigating the risks associated with the transition from LIBOR. The LIBOR transition program includes a comprehensive review of the financial products, agreements, contracts and business processes that may use LIBOR as a reference rate, and the development and execution of a strategy to transition away from LIBOR, with appropriate consideration of the potential financial, customer, counterparty, regulatory and legal impacts.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans, and has approximately $250 million in existing loans for which the repricing index is tied to LIBOR. The Company's swap agreements and other derivatives are governed by the International Swap Dealers Association (\u201cISDA\u201d). ISDA has developed fallback language for swap agreements and has established a protocol to allow counterparties to modify legacy trades to include the new fallback language. The Company also invests in securities and has issued subordinated debt tied to LIBOR. The Company continues to monitor regulatory and legislative activity with regard to these products to identify and execute necessary actions to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex. We may incur significant expense in effecting the transition and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with our borrowers or counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the replacement reference rates. The replacement reference rates could also result\nin a reduction in our interest income. We may also receive inquiries and other actions from regulators about the Company's preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include customer deposits, federal funds purchases, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and short- and long-term debt. We are also members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where we can obtain advances collateralized with eligible assets. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. Other sources of liquidity available to us or Seacoast Bank include the acquisition of additional deposits, the issuance and sale of debt securities, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by other factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. In addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and FHLB advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future and can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds and increase our funding costs if, among other things, customers move funds out of bank deposits and into alternative investments, such as the stock market, that may be perceived as providing superior expected returns. We may be required to seek additional regulatory capital through capital raises at terms that may be very dilutive to existing shareholders.\nOur ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nOur ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay interest on our trust preferred securities or reinstate dividends.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from Seacoast Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock, interest on our trust preferred securities and interest and principal on our debt. Various laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Seacoast Bank may pay us, as further described in \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Payment of Dividends.\u201d Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on common stock. Additionally, if our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make payments on our trust preferred securities or reinstate dividend payments to our common shareholders.\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nWe operate in markets throughout the State of Florida, each with unique characteristics and opportunities. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these and other potential markets. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services in geographic markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage lenders, and securities and insurance brokerage firms. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. Larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can, and have broader customer and geographic bases to draw upon.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our net income.\nTechnology and other changes now allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills, transfer funds directly and obtain loans without banks. This process could result in the loss of interest and fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the income generated from those deposits.\nTransactions utilizing digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and other similar assets, have increased substantially. Certain characteristics of digital asset transactions, such as the speed with which such transactions can be\nconducted, the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and the anonymous nature of the transactions, are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions. Accordingly, digital asset service providers which, at present are not subject to the extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutions, have become active competitors for our customers' banking business. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology, reducing our market share, or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us. Non-bank financial technology providers invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology, particularly digital and mobile technology, and are beginning to offer more traditional banking products either directly or through bank partnerships.\nIn addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet banking services, mobile banking services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nFurther, we may experience a decrease in customer deposits if customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing superior expected returns. When customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, we may lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, and be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to fund our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby increasing our funding costs and adversely affecting our net interest margin.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events, as well as climate change, could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur market areas in Florida are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage and other similar weather events. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses, negatively impacting our business and results of operations. As a result of the potential for such weather events, many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets, which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in our markets. Climate change may be increasing the nature, severity, and frequency of adverse weather conditions, making the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or customers worse.\nFurther, concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Investors, consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. The state of Florida could be disproportionately impacted by long-term climate changes. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions (which could impact customer creditworthiness), operating process changes, changes in demand for products and services, and the like resulting from new laws, regulations, and changing consumer and investor preferences regarding our, or other companies', response to climate change. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nChanges in accounting rules applicable to banks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can\nmaterially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a restatement of our prior period financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2020, we implemented FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This guidance replaced the existing \u201cincurred loss\u201d methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and introduced requirements to estimate current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d). Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses were recognized only when the losses were probable or had been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change requires earlier recognition of credit losses that are deemed expected but not yet probable, and we expect will result in higher reserves for credit losses and higher volatility in the quarterly provision for credit losses.\nThe CECL model also impacts the accounting for bank acquisition activity by requiring the recognition of expected credit losses on acquired loans at the date of acquisition, in addition to the purchase discount, if any. With the exception of purchased loans with credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d), this day-one recognition of the allowance for credit losses is recorded with an offset to net income. For PCD loans, the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the loan at acquisition (i.e., a balance sheet gross-up).\nThe anti-takeover provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and under Florida law may make it more difficult for takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nFlorida law and our Articles of Incorporation include anti-takeover provisions, such as provisions that encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to consult with our board of directors, and which enable the board of directors to negotiate and give consideration on behalf of us and our shareholders and other constituencies to the merits of any offer made. Such provisions, as well as super-majority voting and quorum requirements, and a staggered board of directors, may make any takeover attempts and other acquisitions of interests in us, by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, a proxy fight or otherwise, that have not been approved by our board of directors more difficult and more expensive. These provisions may discourage possible business combinations that a majority of our shareholders may believe to be desirable and beneficial. As a result, our board of directors may decide not to pursue transactions that would otherwise be in the best interests of holders of our common stock.\nOperational Risk\nThe implementation of other new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nWe continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we undergo a process to assess the risks of the initiative, and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls, policies and procedures to mitigate those risks, including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in fraudulent, illegal, wrongful or suspicious activities, and/or activities resulting in consumer harm that adversely affects our customers and/or our business. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective, such misconduct may result in regulatory sanctions and/or penalties, serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships or the ability to attract new customers. In addition, improper use or disclosure of confidential information by our employees, even if inadvertent, could result in serious\nharm to our reputation, financial condition and current and future business relationships. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective.\nWe are subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent acts.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk. Fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. Fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving. A fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of Seacoast, an employee, a vendor, or members of the general public. We are subject to fraud risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, checking and other transactions. When we originate loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Although the Company seeks to mitigate fraud risk and losses through continued investment in systems, resources, and controls, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective in detecting fraud or that we will not experience fraud losses or incur costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect our financial results or reputation.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nManagement regularly monitors, reviews and updates our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the controls will be effective. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, preventing or detecting fraud or providing timely and reliable financial information pursuant to our reporting obligations, which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, ineffective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in our financial information, which could affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur operations rely on external vendors.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations, particularly in the areas of operations, treasury management systems, information technology and security, exposing us to the risk that these vendors will not perform as required by our agreements. An external vendor\u2019s failure to perform in accordance with our agreement could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our regulators also impose requirements on us with respect to monitoring and implementing adequate controls and procedures in connection with our third party vendors.\nFrom time to time, we may decide to retain new vendors for new or existing products and services. Transition to these new vendors may not proceed as anticipated and could negatively impact our customers or our ability to conduct business, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To mitigate this risk, the Company has an established process to oversee vendor relationships.\nWe must effectively manage our information systems risk.\nWe rely heavily on our communications and information systems to conduct our business. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services and methods of delivery. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands. We have and will continue to make technology investments to achieve process improvements and increase efficiency. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors invest substantially greater resources in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively select, develop or implement new technology-driven\nproducts and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nDisruptions to our information systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur communications and information systems remain vulnerable to unexpected disruptions and failures. Any failure or interruption of these systems could impair our ability to serve our customers and to operate our business and could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or enforcement or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. While we have developed extensive recovery plans, we cannot assure that those plans will be effective to prevent adverse effects upon us and our customers resulting from system failures. While we maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems, we cannot assure that this policy would be sufficient to cover all related financial losses and damages should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing a cyber-attack.\nNotwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures, and there is no assurance that our response to any cyber-attack or system interruption, breach or failure will be fully effective to mitigate and remediate the issues resulting from such an event, including the costs, reputational harm and litigation challenges that we may face as a result. Cyber security risks may also occur with our third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We offer our clients the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that our clients' systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our clients or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. While to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cyber security attacks, our systems and those of our clients and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. We may suffer material financial losses related to these risks in the future or we may be subject to liability for compromises to our client or third-party service provider systems. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of client business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation, and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems. In addition, as the domestic and foreign regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees as well as sensitive information related to our operations. Our collection of such Company and customer data is subject to extensive regulation and oversight. Computer break-ins of our systems or our customers\u2019 systems, thefts of data and other breaches and criminal activity may result in significant costs to respond, liability for customer losses if we are at fault, damage to our customer relationships, regulatory scrutiny and enforcement and loss of future business opportunities due to reputational damage. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, will continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to protect sensitive data, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We advise and provide training to our customers regarding protection of their systems, but there is no assurance that our advice and training will be appropriately acted upon by our customers or effective to prevent losses. In some cases we may elect to contribute to the cost of responding to cybercrime against our customers, even when we are not at fault, in order to maintain valuable customer relationships.\nIn our ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our businesses and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding our customers. The integrity of information systems of financial institutions are under significant threat from cyber-attacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and\nsystems for political or criminal purposes. We employ an in-depth, layered, lines of defense approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security and other information security controls.\nCompliance Risk\nWe operate in a heavily regulated environment. Regulatory compliance burdens and associated costs can affect our business, including our reputation, the value of our securities, and the results of our operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are regulated by several regulators, including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFPB, the Small Business Administration, the SEC and NASDAQ. Our success is affected by state and federal regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies, the securities markets and banking, securities and insurance regulators. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers and depositors, not shareholders. The financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes, the effects of which cannot be predicted. These changes, if adopted, could require us to maintain more capital, liquidity and risk controls which could adversely affect our growth, profitability and financial condition. Any such changes in law can impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to our operating policies and procedures, or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nFurther, we expect to continue to commit significant resources to our compliance with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Accounting Oversight Board and NASDAQ. Our failure to track and comply with the various rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the value of our securities.\nAdditionally, the CFPB has issued mortgage-related rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act addressing borrower ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards. The CFPB has also issued rules for loan originators related to compensation, licensing requirements, administration capabilities and restrictions on pursuance of delinquent borrowers. These rules could have a negative effect on the financial performance of Seacoast Bank's mortgage lending operations such as limiting the volume of mortgage originations and sales into the secondary market, increased compliance burden and impairing Seacoast Bank's ability to proceed against certain delinquent borrowers with timely and effective collection efforts.\nBanks with greater than $10 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to certain additional regulatory requirements, including limits on the debit card interchange fees that such banks may collect, changes in the manner in which assessments for FDIC deposit insurance are calculated, and providing the authority to the CFPB to supervise and examine such banks. If Seacoast Bank grows to exceed and sustain assets over $10 billion, which we expect to do in 2022, we will be subject to additional federal regulations, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We estimate that limits to debit card interchange fees that would take effect July 1, 2023 would reduce the Company's revenue, on an annualized basis after taxes, by approximately $7.7 million. Additionally, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements may necessitate that we hire or contract with additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, growth opportunities, or an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our compliance with regulatory requirements, would be adversely affected.\nBoth we and Seacoast Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity and our regulators may modify and adjust such requirements in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed in the future, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, general economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and the market, governmental activities, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough the Company currently complies with all capital requirements, we may be subject to more stringent regulatory capital ratio requirements in the future and we may need additional capital in order to meet those requirements. Our failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, make distributions on our trust preferred securities, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition, generally. Under FDIC rules, if\nSeacoast Bank ceases to be a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, its ability to accept brokered deposits and the interest rates that it pays may both be restricted.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC periodically conduct examinations of our business and Seacoast Bank\u2019s business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and Seacoast Bank also may be subject to future regulatory examinations by the CFPB as discussed in the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section above. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and/or the CFPB were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentrations, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, or other aspects of any of our or Seacoast Bank\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management were in violation of any law, regulation or guideline in effect from time to time, the regulators may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the composition of our concentrations in portfolio or balance sheet assets, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors or to remove officers and directors.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFDIC insurance premiums we pay may change and be significantly higher in the future. Market developments may significantly deplete the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits, thereby making it requisite upon the FDIC to charge higher premiums prospectively. Additionally, if we grow to and sustain more than $10 billion in total assets, which we expect to do in 2022, the method that the FDIC uses to determine the amount of our deposit insurance premium will change. Any increases in our assessment rate, future special assessments, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects or results of operations.\nTax law changes and interpretations may have a negative impact on our earnings.\nThe enactment of the Tax Reform Act, has had, and is expected to continue to have, far reaching and significant effects on us, our customers and the U.S. economy. Further, U.S. tax authorities may at any time clarify and/or modify legislation, administration or judicial changes or interpretations the income tax treatment of corporations. Such changes could adversely affect us, either directly or as a result of the effects on our customers. While lower income tax rates should result in improved net income performance over prospective periods, the extent of the benefit will be influenced by the competitive environment and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) of $27.3 million, based on management\u2019s estimation of the likelihood of those DTAs being realized. These and future DTAs may be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support the amounts recorded.\nManagement expects to realize the $27.3 million in net DTAs well in advance of the statutory carryforward period, based on its forecast of future taxable income. We consider positive and negative evidence, including the impact of reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period. This process requires significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If we were to conclude that significant portions of our DTAs were not more likely than not to be realized (due to operating results or other factors), a requirement to establish a valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe amount of net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes realizable annually for income tax purposes may be reduced by an offering and/or other sales of our capital securities, including transactions in the open market by five percent or greater shareholders, if an ownership change is deemed to occur under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d). The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred under Section 382 is highly fact-specific and can occur through one or more acquisitions of capital stock (including open market trading) if the result of such acquisitions is that the percentage of our outstanding common stock held by shareholders or groups of shareholders owning at least 5% of our common stock at the time of such acquisition, as determined under Section 382, is more than 50 percentage points higher than the lowest percentage of our outstanding common stock owned by such shareholders or groups of shareholders within the prior three-year period. Management does not believe any stock offerings, issuances, or reverse stock split have had any negative implications for the Company under Section 382 to date.\nMerger-Related Risks\nFuture acquisition and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe periodically evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. To the extent we grow through acquisition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches or businesses, as well as other geographic and product expansion activities, involve various risks including:\n\u2022risks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022unanticipated costs and delays;\n\u2022risks that acquired new businesses do not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022risks of entering new market or product areas where we have limited experience;\n\u2022risks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;\n\u2022difficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions, and start-up delays and costs of other expansion activities;\n\u2022potential disruptions to our business;\n\u2022possible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u2022potential short-term decrease in profitability;\n\u2022inaccurate estimates of value assigned to acquired assets; and\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our existing operations and businesses.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we anticipate continuing to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities presented to us in our core markets and beyond. The number of financial institutions headquartered in Florida, the Southeastern United States, and across the country continues to decline through merger and other activity. We expect that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition, as the number of appropriate merger targets decreases, could increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance, including with respect to anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) obligations, consumer protection laws and CRA obligations and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock.\nOur business strategy includes significant growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively, or if we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions or to realize the anticipated benefits of them.\nWe intend to continue to pursue an organic growth strategy for our business while also regularly evaluating potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we expect to engage in selected acquisitions of financial institutions, branch acquisitions and other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful. While we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired, we may encounter difficulties during integration, such as the loss of key employees, the disruption of operations and businesses, loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss, possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies, and unexpected issues with expected branch closures costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit, all of which could divert resources from regular banking operations. Achieving the anticipated benefits\nof these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate these institutions in an efficient and effective manner, governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our growth strategy. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches or other assets, as well as other expansion activities, involves various risks including the risks of incorrectly assessing the credit quality of acquired assets, encountering greater than expected costs of integrating acquired banks or branches into us, the risk of loss of customers and/or employees of the acquired institution or branch, executing cost savings measures, not achieving revenue enhancements and otherwise not realizing the transaction\u2019s anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations, may require investment in integration and in development and enhancement of additional operational and reporting processes and controls and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nOur growth initiatives may also require us to recruit and retain experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives. Accordingly, the failure to identify and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy. In addition, to the extent we expand our lending beyond our current market areas, we could incur additional risks related to those new market areas. We may not be able to expand our market presence in our existing market areas or successfully enter new markets.\nIf we do not successfully execute our acquisition growth plan, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased, that conclusion may result in an impairment charge to goodwill or other tangible or intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations. While we believe we have the executive management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth.\nAdditionally, we may pursue divestitures of non-strategic branches or other assets. Such divestitures involve various risks, including the risks of not being able to timely or fully replace liquidity previously provided by deposits which may be transferred as part of a divestiture, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any depository institution and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nAny future economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth.\nManagement continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint. If conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally or locally, then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, the demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for credit losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and our other products and services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. Our customers may also be adversely impacted by changes in regulatory, trade (including tariffs) and tax policies and laws, all of which could reduce demand for loans and adversely impact our borrowers' ability to repay our loans. In addition, international economic uncertainty could also impact the U.S. financial markets by potentially suppressing stock prices, including ours, and adding it to overall market volatility, which could adversely affect our business. The effects of any economic downturn could continue for many years after the downturn is considered to have ended.\nA reduction in consumer confidence could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant market volatility driven in part by concerns relating to, among other things, actions by the U.S. Congress or imposed through Executive Order by the President of the United States, as well as global political actions or events, including natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, could adversely affect the U.S. or global economies, with direct or indirect impacts on the Company and our business. Results could include reduced consumer and business confidence, credit deterioration, diminished capital markets activity, and actions by the Federal Reserve Board impacting interest rates or other U.S. monetary policy.\nWe must attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in substantial part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel in key positions within the organization. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that we serve is intense. If we are not able to hire, adequately compensate, or retain these key individuals, we may be unable to execute our business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent labor shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also restrict our ability to attract and retain personnel.", "PERMNO": 69586, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SBCF"}
