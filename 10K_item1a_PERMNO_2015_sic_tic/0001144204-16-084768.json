{"cik": "1396033", "company": "Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Operations Unfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions surrounding our products or us could harm our reputation and impair our ability to grow or sustain our business. We rely on our reputation for offering great value, superior service and a broad selection of high-quality, safe flooring products. We are currently involved in a number of government investigations and legal actions, many of which have resulted from unfavorable allegations regarding our products and us. Negative publicity surrounding these government investigations and legal actions could continue to harm our reputation and the demand for our products. Additional unfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions involving our products and us could also affect our perception in the market and our brands and negatively impact our business and financial condition. For instance, unfavorable allegations surrounding the product quality of our laminates sourced from China has and could continue to negatively affect our operations. If this negative impact is significant, our ability to maintain our liquidity and grow or sustain our business could be jeopardized.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are, or may become, involved in legal proceedings, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings. The outcome of some of these legal proceeding could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could be costly to implement or otherwise negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and could affect our ability to obtain capital or access our revolving line of credit and continue as a going concern. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.\nImplementing our Environmental Compliance Plan will be costly to implement and the failure to implement the plan could adversely affect our ability to import and, therefore, our results of operations. As disclosed on October 7, 2015, we reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regarding our compliance with the Lacey Act. In connection with that settlement, we agreed to implement an environmental compliance plan (the \u201cCompliance Plan\u201d) and we will be subject to a probation period of five years. The implementation of the Compliance Plan will be costly and, if the implementation costs are more than we anticipate, it could adversely impact our operating results. Further, in the event we fail to implement the Compliance Plan as required and in accordance with set deadlines, the government may require us to cease the importation of hardwood flooring from China until the DOJ determines that the Compliance Plan has been satisfactorily implemented. If we have to cease the importation of hardwood flooring, our ability to operate would be substantially harmed and our business, including our results of operations, would be adversely affected.\nFederal, provincial, state or local laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could increase our expenses, restrict our ability to conduct our business and expose us to legal risks. We are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations imposed by federal, provincial, state and local authorities in the countries in which we operate including those related to customs, the environment, foreign operations (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), truth-in-advertising, consumer\nprotection, privacy, zoning and occupancy matters as well as the operation of retail stores and warehouse, production and distribution facilities and provision of installation services. In addition, various federal, provincial and state laws govern our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, health care insurance issues, minimum wage standards, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk, our operations could be impacted negatively and our reputation could be damaged. Likewise, if such laws and regulations should change, including labor laws that impact exempt status and overtime eligibility, our costs of compliance may increase, thereby impacting our results and hurting our profitability.\nCertain portions of our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and the health and safety of employees. If we are unable to comply with, extend or renew a material approval, license or permit required by such laws, or if there is a delay in renewing any material approval, license or permit, our net sales and operating results could deteriorate or otherwise cause harm to our business.\nWith regard to our products, we may spend significant time and resources in order to comply with applicable advertising, importation, exportation, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. If we should violate these laws and regulations, we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines, penalties, criminal charges, or other legal risks, be liable for costs and damages, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations should change, we may experience increased costs or incur decreased efficiency in order to adhere to the new standards.\nOur growth strategy is impacted by our ability to open new stores and is subject to many unpredictable factors. As of December 31, 2015, we had 374 stores throughout the United States and Canada, 152 of which we opened after January 1, 2011. Assuming the continued success of our store model and satisfaction of our internal criteria, we plan to open a significant number of new stores over the next several years. This growth strategy and the investment associated with the development of each new store may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or decrease our profits. Our future results and ability to implement our growth strategy will depend on various factors, including the following:\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our reputation of providing safe, compliant products;\n\u2022 consumer recognition of the quality of our products;\n\u2022 the successful resolution of the various pending government investigations and legal proceedings;\n\u2022 the successful selection of new markets and store locations;\n\u2022 the implementation of and results generated by our new showroom format;\n\u2022 our ability to negotiate leases on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 management of store opening costs;\n\u2022 the quality of our operations;\n\u2022 our ability to meet customer demand;\n\u2022 the continued popularity of hardwood flooring;\n\u2022 our cash flow, access to capital and business condition; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the following may impact the net sales and performance of our new stores compared to prior years:\n\u2022 as we open more stores, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our store base will decline;\n\u2022 we may not be able to identify suitable store locations in markets into which we seek to expand and may not be able to open as many stores as planned;\n\u2022 consumers in new markets may be less familiar with our brands, and we may need to increase brand awareness in those markets through additional investments in advertising;\n\u2022 new stores may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs, or may have lower average store net sales, than stores opened in the past;\n\u2022 we may experience difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses, permits or other approvals necessary to open and operate particular store locations;\n\u2022 we may incur higher maintenance costs than in the past;\n\u2022 newly opened stores may not succeed or may reach profitability more slowly than we expect, and the ramp-up to profitability may become longer in the future as we enter more mid-sized and smaller markets and add stores to larger markets where we already have a presence; and\n\u2022 future markets and stores may not be successful and, even if we are successful, our average store net sales and our comparable store net sales may not increase at historical rates.\nFinally, our progress in opening new stores from quarter to quarter may occur at an uneven rate, which may result in quarterly net sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods.\nOur net sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable store net sales are less than we expect. While future net sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new store openings, the level of comparable store net sales (which represent the change in period-over-period net sales for stores beginning their thirteenth full month of operation) will also affect our net sales growth and business results. Among other things, increases in our baseline store volumes and the number of new stores opened in existing markets, which tend to open at a higher base level of net sales, will impact our comparable store net sales. As a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable store net sales growth or that the change in comparable store net sales could be negative. If this were to happen, net sales and profit growth would be adversely affected.\nIncreased transportation costs, particularly those relating to the cost of fuel, could harm our results of operations. The efficient transportation of our products through our supply chain is a critical component of our operations. If the cost of fuel or other costs, such as import tariffs, duties and international container rates, rise, it could result in increases in our cost of sales due to additional transportation charges and in the fees delivery companies charge us to transport our products to our stores and customers. We may be unable to increase the price of our products to offset increased transportation charges, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nBusiness and operation risks exist in connection with our distribution centers. In 2013, we purchased 110 acres of undeveloped land in Henrico County, Virginia upon which we constructed a million square foot distribution center. The facility became fully operational in January 2015. This was our first real estate purchase and is the first distribution center owned by us. The cost of operating and managing the East Coast distribution center may exceed our expectations and we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from consolidating our East Coast facilities into this East Coast distribution center.\nIn addition, since early 2014, we have leased and operated a 500,000 square foot distribution center in Pomona, California, our first distribution center located outside of Virginia. The costs of operating may exceed\nour expectations and we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate. Further, we may face challenges relating to the management of inventory in separate warehouse facilities located on opposite coasts and the impact of the East Coast distribution facility.\nIf either of these facilities or our inventory held in those locations were damaged or destroyed by fire, wood infestation or other causes, our distribution processes would be disrupted, which could cause significant delays in delivery. This could impede our ability to stock our stores and deliver products to our customers, and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nDamage, destruction or disruption of our Toano facility or equipment could significantly impact our operations and impede our ability to finish and distribute certain of our products. Our Toano, Virginia facility serves as our corporate headquarters and, among other things, houses our primary computer systems, which control our management information and inventory management systems. In addition, in 2015, we finished approximately 79% of all Bellawood products, as well as small quantities of certain other products, there. In 2015, Bellawood flooring accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales. If the Toano facility or equipment were damaged or destroyed, it could harm our operations, cause significant lost production and impact our ability to fulfill customer demand.\nThe operation of stores in Canada may present increased legal and operational risks. We opened our first stores in Canada in 2011 and currently operate eight store locations there. As a result of our limited penetration and operation history in the Canadian market, these stores may continue to be less successful than we expect. Additionally, greater investments in advertising and promotional activity may be required to continue to build brand awareness in that market. Furthermore, by comparison, we have limited experience with the legal and regulatory environments and market practices outside of the United States and cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate profitably in the Canadian market or in a manner and with results similar to our U.S. stores. We may also incur increased costs in complying with applicable Canadian laws and regulations as they pertain to both our products and our operations.\nThe operation of our Representative Office in China may present increased legal and operational risks. We established a representative office in Shanghai, China to facilitate our product sourcing in Asia and we may incur additional costs associated with its operation. In addition, we may incur increased costs to comply with applicable Chinese laws and regulations that exceed our expectations. Further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to, among other things, litigation and government and agency investigations.\nFailure to effectively manage our third party installers may present increased legal and operational risks. In certain geographical regions, we manage third party installers who provide installation services to some of our customers. In some of these jurisdictions, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third party installers. We have established processes and procedures designed to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement and litigation and our net sales and our profitability and reputation could be harmed.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results. Our plans call for a significant number of new stores, and increased orders from our website, call center and catalogs. Our existing management information systems, including our store management systems, compliance procedures and financial and reporting controls, may be unable to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain regional and store managers and personnel for our compliance and financial and reporting departments. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on us. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover existing or future claims. We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, property damage, cyber security and professional liability, including directors and officers insurance:\n\u2022 We are self-insured on certain health insurance plans and are responsible for losses up to a certain limit for these respective plans.\n\u2022 Beginning in 2013, we are self-insured with regard to workers\u2019 compensation coverage, in which case we are responsible for losses up to certain retention limits on both a per-claim and aggregate basis.\n\u2022 We continue to be responsible for losses up to a certain limit for general liability and property damage insurance.\n\u2022 Our professional liability and cyber security insurance contain limitations on the amount and scope of coverage.\nWith the large number of cases and government investigations we have pending, we may be required to defend the Company, its officers, directors and former employees and we may be subject to financial harm in the event such cases or investigations are adversely determined and insurance coverage will not, or is not sufficient to, cover any related losses. For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Fluctuating healthcare costs, our growth rate and changes from our past experience with workers\u2019 compensation claims could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe have entered into a number of lease agreements with companies controlled by our founder and this concentration of leases may pose certain business risks. As of December 31, 2015, we lease our Toano facility, which includes a store location, a warehouse and 30 of our other store locations from entities owned, in whole or in part, by Tom Sullivan, our founder and a current member of our board of directors. Although our percentage of total stores leased from such entities has decreased over the last year, this concentration of leases subjects us to risk in the event action or inaction by Tom or such entities impacts our leasehold interests in the locations.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers, Products and Product Sourcing If our suppliers do not use ethical business practices, comply with applicable laws and regulations and ensure that their products meet our quality standards, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity and we could be subject to legal risk. While our suppliers agree to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental and labor practices, we do not control our suppliers. Accordingly, despite our continued investment in quality control, we cannot guarantee that they comply with such laws and regulations or operate in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. Violation of environmental, labor or other laws by our suppliers or their failure to operate in a legal, ethical and responsible manner could cause us to violate such laws and could reduce demand for our products if, as a result of such violation or failure, we were to attract negative publicity. Further, we require our suppliers to adhere to our quality standards. While we do monitor our suppliers\u2019 adherence to such standards, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify their non-compliance. Moreover, the failure of our suppliers to adhere to applicable legal requirements and the quality standards that we set for our products could lead to government investigations, litigation, write-offs and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and reputation. We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or violated environmental or other laws. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective or otherwise in violation of applicable law, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Further, in such instances, we may be subject to legal action. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be available or adequate for the liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.\nOur ability to obtain products from abroad and the operations of many of our international suppliers are subject to risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our operations. We rely on a select group of international suppliers to provide us with flooring products that meet our specifications. In 2015, approximately 48% of our product was sourced from North America, approximately 39% of our product was sourced from Asia, approximately 8% was sourced from Europe and Australia and approximately 5% was sourced South America. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with obtaining products from abroad, including:\n\u2022 political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries where our products originate;\n\u2022 currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022 the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and climate change issues; labor conditions; quality and safety standards; trade restrictions; and restrictions on funds transfers;\n\u2022 the imposition of new or different duties (including antidumping and countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes and/or other charges on exports or imports, including as a result of errors in the classification of products upon entry or changes in the interpretation or application of rates or regulations relating to the import or export of our products;\n\u2022 disruptions or delays in production, shipments, delivery or processing through ports of entry (including those resulting from strikes, lockouts, work-stoppages or slowdowns, or other forms of labor unrest);\n\u2022 changes in local economic conditions in countries where our suppliers are located; and\n\u2022 differences in product standards, acceptable business practice and legal environments.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could disrupt the ability of our suppliers to ship certain products to us cost-effectively or at all, which could harm our operations.\nOur ability to offer hardwood flooring, particularly products made of more exotic species, depends on the continued availability of sufficient suitable hardwood. Our business strategy depends on offering a wide assortment of hardwood flooring to our customers. We sell flooring made from species ranging from domestic maple, oak and pine to imported cherry, koa, mahogany and teak. Some of these species are scarce, and we cannot be assured of their continued availability. Our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of hard-to-find species depends on our suppliers\u2019 ability to furnish those species, which, in turn, could be affected by many things including events such as forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases, prolonged drought and other adverse weather and climate conditions. Government regulations relating to forest management practices also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to harvest or export timber, and changes to regulations and forest management policies, or the implementation of new laws or regulations, could impede their ability to do so. If our suppliers cannot deliver sufficient hardwood and we cannot find replacement suppliers, our net sales and operating results may be negatively impacted.\nOur dependence on certain suppliers makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them. We rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for a significant portion of our supply needs. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers, and we typically obtain our hardwood supplies on an order-by-order basis, writing orders for future deliveries from 90 to 180 days before delivery. In the future, our suppliers may be unable to supply us, or supply us on acceptable terms, due to various factors, which could include political instability in the supplier\u2019s country, insufficient production capacity, product line failures, collusion, a supplier\u2019s financial instability, inability or refusal to comply with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs or our standards, duties, insufficient transport capacity and other factors beyond our control. If we can no longer obtain merchandise from our larger suppliers, or they refuse to continue to supply us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find replacement suppliers, we could experience deterioration in our net sales and operating results.\nIf we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, our ability to obtain products that meet our high quality standards could be harmed. We purchase flooring directly from mills located around the world. We believe that these direct supplier relationships are important to our business. In order to retain the competitive advantage that we believe results from these relationships, we need to continue to identify, develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our high standards for quality and our requirements for hardwood in a timely and efficient manner. The need to develop new relationships will be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations, enhance our product offerings, and expand our product assortment and geographic source of origin in the future. Any inability to do so could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nIncreased hardwood costs could harm our results of operations. The cost of the various species of hardwood that are used in our products is important to our profitability. Hardwood lumber costs fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, product availability, environmental restrictions, government regulation and trade policies, duties, weather conditions, processing and freight costs, and delivery delays and disruptions. We generally do not have long-term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing hardwood costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, and we may not always be able to increase the selling prices of our products in response to increases in supply costs. If we cannot address changing hardwood costs appropriately, it could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nWe may not be able to successfully anticipate consumer trends and our failure to do so may adversely impact our net sales and profitability. As part of our business proposition, it is important for us to anticipate and respond to changing preferences and consumer demands in a timely manner. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores and our image with our customers may be harmed, which could reduce customer traffic in our stores and adversely affect our net sales. Moreover, consumer demand within our mix of products may shift and such change may negatively impact our net sales and operating results.\nRisks Related to Economic Factors and Our Industry Changes in economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business, financial condition and results of operations have and may continue to be affected by various economic factors. Changes in the current economic environment and uncertainty about the future could lead to reduced consumer and business spending, including by our customers. Such changes may also cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably. Further, a reduced access to credit may adversely affect the ability of consumers to purchase our products. This potential\nreduction in access to credit may impact our ability to offer customers credit card financing through third party credit providers on terms similar to those offered previously, or at all. In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers and other service providers. If such conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations may be severely impacted.\nThe hardwood flooring industry depends on the economy, home remodeling activity, the homebuilding industry and other important factors. The hardwood flooring industry is highly dependent on the remodeling of existing homes and new home construction. In turn, remodeling and new home construction depend on a number of factors which are beyond our control, including interest rates, tax policy, employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, real estate prices, demographic trends, weather conditions, natural disasters and general economic conditions. For example, discretionary consumer spending could be limited, spending on remodeling of existing homes could be reduced and purchases of new homes could decline if:\n\u2022 the national economy or any regional or local economy where we operate weakens;\n\u2022 interest rates rise;\n\u2022 credit becomes less available;\n\u2022 tax rates and health care costs increase;\n\u2022 regions where we operate experience unfavorable demographic trends;\n\u2022 fuel costs or utility expenses increase; or\n\u2022 home prices depreciate.\nIn the event of a decrease in discretionary spending, home remodeling activity or new home construction, demand for our products, including hardwood flooring, could be impacted negatively and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetition could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share. We operate in the wood flooring industry, which is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from national and regional home improvement chains, national and regional specialty flooring chains, Internet-based companies and privately-owned single-site enterprises. We compete on the basis of price, customer service, store location and range, quality and availability of the hardwood flooring that we offer our customers. If our positioning with regard to one or more of these factors should erode, deteriorate, fail to resonate with consumers or misalign with demand or expectations, our business and results may be impacted negatively.\nOur competitive position is also influenced by the availability, quality and cost of merchandise, labor costs, finishing, distribution and sales efficiencies and our productivity compared to that of our competitors. Further, as we expand into new and unfamiliar markets, we may face different competitive environments than in the past. Likewise, as we continue to enhance and develop our product offerings, we may experience new competitive conditions.\nSome of our competitors are larger organizations, have existed longer, are more diversified in the products they offer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. In addition, our competitors may forecast market developments more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours or produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share.\nHardwood flooring may become less popular as compared to other types of floor coverings in the future. For example, our products are made using various hardwood species, including rare exotic hardwood species, and concern over the environmental impact of tree harvesting could shift consumer preference towards\nsynthetic or inorganic flooring. In addition, hardwood flooring competes against carpet, vinyl sheet, vinyl tile, ceramic tile, natural stone and other types of floor coverings. If consumer preferences shift toward types of floor coverings other than hardwood flooring, we may experience decreased demand for our products.\nAll of these competitive factors may harm us and reduce our net sales and operating results.\nIf we are unable to access our credit facility or other sources of capital, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could suffer, We have relied on a bank credit facility to fund seasonal needs for working capital. Our continued access to this facility depends on our ability to meet the conditions to borrowing, including that all representations are true and correct at the time of the borrowing. Our failure to meet these requirements or obtain alternative sources of capital could impact:\n\u2022 our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 our ability to meet liquidity needs; and\n\u2022 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology If our management information systems experience disruptions, it could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales. We depend on our management information systems to integrate the activities of our stores, website and call center, to process orders, to respond to customer inquiries, to manage inventory, to purchase merchandise and to sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. We may incur significant expenses in order to repair any such operational problems. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and customers or lost sales. Moreover, our entire corporate network, including our telephone lines, is on an Internet-based network. Accordingly, if our network is disrupted, we may experience delayed communications within our operations and between our customers and ourselves, and may not be able to communicate at all via our network, including via telephones connected to our network.\nThe selection and implementation of information technology initiatives may impact our operational efficiency and productivity. In order to better manage our business, we expect to invest in our information systems. In doing so, we must select the correct investments and implement them in an efficient manner. The costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Furthermore, these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner. Accordingly, issues relating to our selection and implementation of information technology initiatives may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nAny disruption of our website or our call center could disrupt our business and lead to reduced net sales and reputational damage. Our website and our call center are integral parts of our integrated multi-channel strategy. Customers use our website and our call center as information sources on the range of products available to them and to order our products, samples or catalogs. Our website, in particular, is vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. If we cannot successfully maintain our website and call center in good working order, it could reduce our net sales and damage our reputation. Further, the costs associated with such maintenance may exceed our estimations.\nWe may incur costs and losses resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information. We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our stores and through our call center. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. As a result, we may become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Further, a compromise of our security systems that results in our customers\u2019 personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A security breach could also require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.\nAdditionally, privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\nRisks Related to Our Personnel Our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel. We believe that our success has depended and continues to depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss, for any reason, of the services of any of these key individuals and any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss, could damage our business and harm our reputation.\nWe announced the appointment of John M. Presley as our chief executive officer in November 2015. Mr. Presley replaced Thomas D. Sullivan, who had been serving as acting chief executive officer since Robert M. Lynch\u2019s resignation in May 2015. Earlier in 2015, we appointed Gregory A. Whirley, Jr. as our interim Chief Financial Officer to replace Daniel E. Terrell, who had served as our Chief Financial Officer since October 2006. Also in 2015, we integrated the leadership of our merchandising and marketing departments and promoted Marco Q. Pescara from Chief Marketing Officer to Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition involves inherent risk, and we could experience disruptions in our executive management transition, or any executive management transition that may occur in the future, which could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance.\nOur success depends upon our ability to meet our labor needs. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managers and associates. Buying hardwood flooring is an infrequent event, and typical consumers have very little knowledge of the range, characteristics and suitability of the products available to them before starting the purchasing process. Therefore, consumers in the hardwood flooring market expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about the entire assortment of products offered by the retailer and the process of choosing and installing hardwood flooring. As a result, competition for qualified store managers and sales associates among flooring retailers is intense. We may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our current operations and support our potential future growth. In addition, as we expand into new markets, we may find it more difficult to hire, motivate and retain qualified employees.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements or work practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Marketing and Advertising Our success depends on the effectiveness of our advertising strategy. We believe that our growth was achieved in part through our successful investment in local and national advertising. Historically, we have used extensive advertising to encourage customers to drive to our stores, which were typically located some distance from population centers in areas that have lower rents than traditional retail locations. Further, a significant portion of our advertising was directed at the DIY and DIFM consumers. While our marketing strategy continues to support our real estate strategy and remains focused on retaining the DIY and DIFM customers, we have broadened the reach and frequency of our advertising to increase the recognition of our value proposition and the number of customers served. We may need to further increase our advertising expense to support our business strategies in the future. If our advertisements fail to draw customers in the future, or if the cost of advertising or other marketing materials increases significantly, we could experience declines in our net sales and operating results.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and impact our business. Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. The successful implementation of our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logo and the names and logos of our brands. We may incur significant costs and expenses relating to our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party infringes on or misappropriates our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could adversely affect our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nWe may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to establish the invalidity, non-infringement, or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others. Likewise, we may have similar claims or litigation brought against us by competitors and others. Under either situation and regardless of any ultimate determination on the merits, we could incur significant expense and be forced to divert the efforts of key employees from our operations. Moreover, such claims or litigation could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock Our common stock price may be volatile and all or part of any investment in our common stock may be lost. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this report, including:\n\u2022 our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022 the public\u2019s reaction to our filings with the SEC, our press releases and other public announcements;\n\u2022 unfavorable market reactions to allegations regarding the safety of our products and the related litigation and/or government investigations resulting therefrom, as well as any payments, judgments or other losses in connection with such lawsuits and/or investigations;\n\u2022 changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by research analysts who follow Lumber Liquidators or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022 variations in general economic conditions;\n\u2022 actions of our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers;\n\u2022 the arrival or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022 other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but may cause declines in the market\nprice of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of research analysts and investors due to various factors. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in comparable store net sales and customer transactions, including as a result of declining consumer confidence or the introduction of new products;\n\u2022 the timing of new store openings and related net sales and expenses;\n\u2022 profitability and performance of our stores;\n\u2022 the timing of remodels and relocations of existing stores and related net sales and expenses;\n\u2022 the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities;\n\u2022 variations in general economic conditions;\n\u2022 unfavorable customer reactions to allegations regarding the safety of our products, the impact of litigation and/or government investigations to which we are subject, as well as any payments, judgments or other losses in connection with such lawsuits and/or investigations;\n\u2022 the timing and scope of sales promotions and product introductions;\n\u2022 changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u2022 fluctuations in supply prices; and\n\u2022 tax expenses, impairment charges and other non-operating costs.\nDue to these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average store net sales or comparable store net sales in any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of research analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOur anti-takeover defense provisions may cause our common stock to trade at market prices lower than it might absent such provisions. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include a staggered board, the availability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, provisions restricting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or requiring one to be called or from taking action by written consent and provisions that set forth advance notice procedures for stockholders\u2019 nominations of directors and proposals of topics for consideration at meetings of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which relates to business combinations with interested stockholders, applies to us. These provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. In addition, these provisions may cause our common stock to trade at a market price lower than it might absent such provisions.\nRisk Related to Accounting Standards Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, consolidation, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, lease accounting, sales returns reserves, inventories, self-insurance, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management.\nChanges in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of its internal controls that need improvement. Even so, we continue to work to improve our internal controls. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 92400, "SIC": 5211, "TIC": "LL"}
