{"cik": "1288359", "company": "OTELCO INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn evaluating our business, every investor should carefully consider the following risk factors. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following risks. Our business operations could also be affected by additional risk factors that apply generally to companies, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nPublic Health Threats or Outbreaks of Communicable Diseases Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operations and Overall Financial Performance.\nWe may face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases. A global health crisis, such as the current outbreak of coronavirus or COVID-19, could adversely affect the United States and global economies and limit the ability of enterprises to conduct business for an indefinite period of time. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted financial markets and international trade, resulted in increased unemployment levels and significantly impacted global supply chains, all of which have the potential to impact our business.\nIn addition, government authorities have implemented various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, limitations on business operations, stay-at-home orders and social distancing protocols. While our business has been deemed critical infrastructure by the United States Department of Homeland Security, the economic impact of the aforementioned actions may impair our ability to sustain sufficient financial liquidity and impact our financial results. Specifically, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could: (i) result in an increase in costs related to delayed payments from customers and uncollectable accounts, (ii) cause a reduction in revenue related to late fees and other charges related to governmental regulations, (iii) cause delays and disruptions in the supply chain related to obtaining necessary materials for our network infrastructure or customer premise equipment, (iv) cause workforce disruptions, including the availability of qualified personnel; and (v) cause other unpredictable events.\nAs we cannot predict the duration or scope of the global health crisis, the anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nThe Telecommunications Industry Experiences Continuous Competition.\nThe market for telecommunication services is highly competitive. Currently, we have competition in eight of our markets from cable providers and an electric co-operative. Certain competitors benefit from brand\nrecognition, financial, personnel and marketing resources and access to capital that are significantly greater than ours, which may also be affected by further industry consolidation. In addition, our relative size and the distance between our regional businesses makes it more difficult for us to achieve scale economies and efficiencies than certain of our competitors, which puts us at a competitive disadvantage and may lead to customer attrition. We cannot predict the number of new competitors that will emerge, especially as a result of existing or new federal and state regulatory or legislative actions. Increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIn all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers. As wireless carriers continue to build out and enhance their voice and data networks and add products and services targeted to the fixed wireless market, we may experience increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow.\nThe current and potential competitors in our RLEC territories include cable television companies; electric utilities; CLECs and other providers of telecommunications and data services, including internet and VoIP service providers; wireless carriers; satellite television and internet companies; alternate access providers; and neighboring incumbent local exchange carriers.\nIn Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, our CLEC operations may encounter changes in the competitive landscape that would affect our continued ability to add and/or retain customers, sustain current pricing plans and control the cost of access to incumbent carrier customers. Our CLEC leases a portion of its facilities, reducing its ability to adjust to price competition. A portion of these \u201clast mile\u201d facilities leased from the incumbent carrier can no longer be ordered under the same terms and pricing for new customers. Existing terms and pricing may become more expensive in February 2023, which would negatively impact our cost of service.\nWe provide our long distance services within our territories, primarily through bundling long distance with other local services and providing a single bill for these services. Carriers offering VoIP services continue to develop attractive new offerings. There can be no assurance that our local services revenue, including long distance services, will not decrease in the future due to competition and/or the introduction of new services by current and new competitors.\nChanges in the Regulation of the Telecommunications Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue or Cash Flow.\nWe operate in an industry that is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The majority of our revenue has historically been supported by and/or subject to some level of regulation. Certain federal and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, federal and state universal service funds, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. The FCC ICC Order began significantly reducing access revenue received by us in July 2012. Subsequently, we accepted the FCC\u2019s A-CAM offer for all of our eleven RLECs, which replaced USF HCL revenue for ten of those RLECs effective as of January 1, 2017, and one RLEC effective as of January 1, 2019, requiring additional network capital expenditures. A-CAM support will decline over a twelve year period. In addition, there can be no assurance that recent FCC actions will not be changed in the future. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIf We Fail to Meet Our Broadband Deployment Obligations Under A-CAM, We May Lose All or Part of Our A-CAM Support.\nOn March 23, 2016, the FCC released an order, which adopted changes to the Universal Service programs, directed to preserve and advance voice and broadband service in areas served by rate-of-return carriers. The order provided qualifying rate-of-return carriers the option of receiving model-based support through A-CAM in lieu of legacy rate-of-return support through CAF BLS, formerly ICLS, and USF HCL. Ten of our RLECs qualified for A-CAM and elected to accept A-CAM support beginning in 2017. Our other RLEC became eligible for A-CAM in 2019 and elected to receive support beginning in January 2019. These elections\nare expected to provide A-CAM support through 2028. However, the A-CAM election includes specific broadband deployment obligations, including the number of locations to be capable of specific broadband speeds within certain eligible Census Blocks in our service areas. If we fail to meet these broadband deployment obligations, we may lose all or part of our A-CAM support, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIf We Continue to Lose Voice Lines and Cannot Maintain or Grow Data Lines, Our Business and Results of Operations Will Likely Be Adversely Affected.\nOur business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services. We have experienced net voice line loss in our markets due to wireless substitution and increased competition from organizations using different delivery technologies. The recent investments in data network upgrades have resulted in modest growth in data services in 2020. Without continued investment in fiber and other delivery technologies, we may return to a historical pattern of data service decline, which, when coupled with expected net voice line loss in our markets, could impact our ability to fund continued investment in our network.\nWe May Not Be Able to Integrate New Technologies and Provide New Services in a Cost-Efficient Manner.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions, changes in pricing and evolving industry standards. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming to install and integrate into our network. Our financial condition or the terms and conditions included in our credit facility may limit our ability to make additional capital expenditures or procure additional products. In addition, a substantive investment by a competitor in a new technology could challenge our position in the marketplace, as the services offered by our competitor arising out of new technology may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate the revenue anticipated from such services.\nDisruptions in Our Networks and Infrastructure May Cause Us to Lose Customers and Incur Additional Expenses.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and timely service over our networks. We face the following risks to our networks and infrastructure:\n\u2022\nour territories could have significant weather events which physically damage network infrastructure, potentially disrupting our ability to provide service and potentially encouraging our customers to find alternative service providers;\n\u2022\nour rural geography creates the risk of security breaches, break-ins and sabotage;\n\u2022\nmuch of our equipment has long service lives, which could increase the frequency of malfunction and outage;\n\u2022\nour equipment, access and network interface suppliers could experience outages, delivery limitations or labor issues which could impact our ability to provide services to our customers;\n\u2022\npower surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking and software or hardware defects that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nunusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers\u2019 networks.\nDisruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. In addition, the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC, VPUC and/or WVPSC could require us to issue credits on customer bills for such service interruptions, further impacting revenue and cash flow.\nOur Operating Activities Are Subject to Risks Caused by Misappropriation, Misuse, Leakage, Falsification and Accidental Release or Loss of Information Maintained in Our Information Technology Systems.\nWe operate critical infrastructure and our operating activities are subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification and accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data. These risks could result from cyber-attacks, which may be committed by our employees or external factors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, or by other means. Cyber-attacks against companies have increased in frequency, sophistication, scope and potential harm in recent years. Any preventive actions we have taken or may take to reduce the risks of cyber-attacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a cyber-attack in the future, and our resources available to take preventive actions in the future may be limited. We could be exposed to significant costs if any of the above risks were to materialize, and any of the events described above could impair our operations, damage the reputation and credibility of us and our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. Costs related to these risks could include incentives offered to existing customers to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation, which may be protracted in nature. We could also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.\nOur Business is Geographically Concentrated and Dependent on Regional Economic Conditions.\nOur business is conducted primarily in north central Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia and, accordingly, our business is dependent upon the general economic conditions of these regions. There can be no assurance that future economic conditions in these regions will not impact demand for our services or cause residents or businesses to relocate to other regions, which may adversely impact our business, revenue and cash flow. There can also be no assurance that these regions will respond to market and economic changes in a similar nature to urban markets or other regional areas.\nOur Success Depends on a Small Number of Key Personnel.\nOur success depends on the personal efforts of a small group of skilled employees and senior management. The rural nature of much of our service area provides for a smaller pool of skilled telephone employees and increases the challenge of hiring employees. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur Performance Is Subject to a Number of Economic and Non-Economic Factors That Are Beyond Our Control, Which We May Not Be Able to Predict Accurately.\nThere are factors that may be beyond our control that could affect our operations and business. Such factors include adverse changes in the conditions in the specific markets for our services, the conditions in the broader market for telecommunication services, natural disasters and health emergencies, including earthquakes, fires, power outages, typhoons, floods, pandemics or epidemics such as the coronavirus and manmade events such as civil unrest, labor disruption, international trade disputes, international conflicts, terrorism, wars and critical infrastructure attacks and the conditions in the domestic and global economies, generally. Any of these events, among others, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. For example, the COVID-19 may impact the global economy or negatively affect various aspects of our business, including our workforce and demand for our services, which could impact our ability to deliver services to our customers and make it more difficult to meet our expectations and obligations.\nAlthough our performance is affected by the general condition of the economy, not all of our services are affected equally. Voice revenue is generally linked to relatively consistent variables such as population changes, housing starts and general economic activity levels in the areas served. Data and cable television revenue is generally related to more variable factors, such as changing levels of discretionary spending on entertainment and the adoption of e-commerce and other online activities by our current or prospective customers. It is not possible for management to accurately predict all of these factors and the impact of such factors on our performance.\nChanges in the competitive, technological and regulatory environments may also impact our ability to increase revenue and/or earnings from the provision of local wireline services. We may therefore have to place increased emphasis on developing and realizing revenue through the provision of new and enhanced services with higher growth potential. In such a case, there is a risk that these revenue sources, as well as our cost savings efforts through further efficiency gains, will not grow or develop at a fast enough pace to offset declines in local residential services. It is also possible that, as we invest in new technologies and services, demand for those new services may not develop. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our service offerings through the development of new services, and our efforts to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFailure to Receive Approved Levels of FCC Support Funding Would Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue and Cash Flow.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, A-CAM replaced USF HCL for two of our three RLECS that had previously received USF HCL support payments, and the third RLEC continued to receive USF HCL and CAF BLS support payments through December 2018. On January 1, 2019, it qualified for, and began receiving, A-CAM II funding. The A-CAM and A-CAM II support requires us to make additional capital investments to build out our network to support the delivery of higher broadband speeds. If our participating RLECs do not receive the approved level of A-CAM or A-CAM II support from the FCC for any reason, our business, revenue and cash flow would be negatively affected.\nThe outcome of any future FCC proceedings and other regulatory or legislative changes could affect the amount of support that we receive, and could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. If a wireless or other telecommunication carrier receives ETC status in our service areas or even outside of our service areas, the amount of support we receive from the USF HCL could decline under current rules, and under some proposed USF HCL rule changes, could be significantly reduced.\nUSAC serves as the administrative agent to collect data and distribute funds for USF and in 2006, it began conducting High Cost Beneficiary audits, designed to ensure compliance with FCC rules and program requirements and to assist in program compliance. USAC randomly selects RLECs to be audited each year and several of our RLECs have been selected for one of these audits each year. In December 2016, four of our RLECs were selected for a payment quality assurance audit, which has since been completed with no material findings. USAC has issued a no further action determination letter for three of these audits and the fourth audit revealed an overpayment due to us, which we refunded to USAC in July 2017. If USAC determines in any future audit that any of our data submissions were incorrect, we could be required to return funds to USAC for the period under review, which would negatively affect our business revenue and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe Are Subject to Restrictive Debt Covenants That Limit Our Business Flexibility By Imposing Operating and Financial Restrictions on Our Operations.\nOur credit facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, which may limit our ability to invest in new services or respond to competitive forces, including, without limitation, restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwind up, liquidate, merge, or consolidate with any other person or transfer or dispose of certain properties or assets;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nmake certain types of restricted payments, including dividends on our common stock, investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into specified transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nFuture debt obligations may impose similar or other restrictive covenants.\nOur credit facility also requires quarterly fixed principal payments and annual variable excess cash flow payments, which may limit cash available for our operations and investment in our network. In addition, our financial covenants may require the use of operating cash to pay outstanding debt and limit our ability to invest in our operations.\nThe Interest Rate of Our Term Loan Is Set at a Margin Over an Adjusted LIBOR Rate.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates applicable to our term loan (including any incremental term loans incurred under the accordion feature) and the revolving loans (other than the swing line loans) under our credit facility are set at a margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate (which is defined as the higher of (1) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and (2) 0.0% per annum) or a base rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum, (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% per annum, and (d) 0.0% per annum), at our option. Interest rates applicable to the swing line loans under our credit facility are set at a margin over the above-mentioned base rate.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is calculated based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. In preparation for the potential phase out of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate our financial obligations and derivative instruments that utilize LIBOR. However, these efforts may not be successful in mitigating the legal and financial risk from changing the reference rate in our legacy agreements. Furthermore, the discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf We Fail to Maintain Proper and Effective Internal Control over Financial Reporting, Our Ability to Produce Accurate and Timely Financial Statements Could Be Impaired, Which Could Harm Our Operating Results, Investors\u2019 Views of Us and, as a Result, the Value of Our Common Stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d for SEC reporting purposes, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various SEC reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which section would otherwise require us to annually obtain an audited opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThere Are Material Uncertainties and Risks Associated with the Merger Agreement and Proposed Merger.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger, as well as any delays in the expected timeframe, could cause disruption and create uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks include:\n\u2022\nan adverse effect on our relationships with vendors, customers, and employees;\n\u2022\na diversion of a significant amount of management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business before the closing of the Merger;\n\u2022\npossibly foregoing certain business opportunities that we might otherwise pursue absent the Merger; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties attracting and retaining key employees.\nThe Proposed Merger May Not Be Completed in a Timely Manner or At All.\nCompletion of the proposed Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, (1) absence of any law or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) enacted or issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise making illegal the consummation of the proposed Merger, (2) accuracy of representations and warranties, subject to specified materiality thresholds, (3) compliance with covenants, obligations and conditions in the Merger Agreement in all material respects, and (4) the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOn April 4, 2020, the President of the United States issued Executive Order No. 13913 Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), which formalized the ad-hoc foreign investment review process (formerly referred to as \u201cTeam Telecom\u201d) applicable to FCC licenses and transactions. The Executive Order empowers the Committee to review FCC license and transfer applications involving foreign participation to determine whether grant of the requested license or transfer approval may pose a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States, and to review existing licenses to identify any additional or new risks to national security or law enforcement interests that did not exist when a license was first granted. Following an investigation, the Committee may recommend that the FCC revoke or modify of existing licenses, or deny or condition approval of new licenses and license transfers. The proposed Merger is subject to review by the Committee. At this time, it is not possible for us to predict the outcome of the review of the proposed Merger by this new Committee and whether the Committee may condition approval of the Merger to any specific mitigation arrangement or other conditions. Any such arrangement may result in additional compliance obligations that may affect our expenses and business operations in the future.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement may require us and Parent to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities and neither party is required to take any action with respect to obtaining any regulatory approval that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Parent and its affiliates (taken as a whole) or Otelco and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole). There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. There can be no assurance that all of these required approvals and clearances will be obtained or will be obtained on a timely basis. The COVID-19 outbreak may also result in delays to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger.\nLawsuits have been, and may be, filed against us relating to the Merger and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from being completed in the time frame expected or at all. Each of Otelco and Parent has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement.\nFailure to Complete the Merger Could Negatively Impact Our Business, Financial Results and Stock Price.\nIf the Merger is delayed or not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\ndecline in share price to the extent that the current price of Class A common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community;\n\u2022\nloss of business opportunities and the ability to effectively respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Parent a termination fee and additional expenses.\nWe Have Incurred, and Will Incur, Substantial Direct and Indirect Costs as a Result of the Proposed Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional advisors, printing and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and some of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.", "PERMNO": 13938, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "OTEL"}
