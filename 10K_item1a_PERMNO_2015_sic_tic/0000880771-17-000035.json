{"cik": "880771", "company": "SCICLONE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information in this report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nAlthough we reported net income of $30.7 million, $29.5 million and $25.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and have reported full year annual net income since fiscal 2009, we have experienced occasional quarterly losses and as a result of accumulated annual operating losses prior to fiscal 2009, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $88 million as of December 31, 2016. If our operating expenses were to increase or if we were not able to increase or sustain revenue, we may not maintain profitability over the next 12 months.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility due to many factors, some of which we have no control over, including:\n\u00b7\nour substantial dependence on our sales of ZADAXIN in China;\n\u00b7\nour revenues are dependent on our obtaining or maintaining regulatory licenses and compliance with other country-specific regulations, including renewing our China Import Drug License for ZADAXIN, which must be renewed every 5 years;\n\u00b7\nChinese government actions intended to reduce pharmaceutical prices such as the reduction in some provinces of the governmentally permitted maximum listed price for our products and increased oversight of the health care market and pharmaceutical industry;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulatory action affecting our Company or our drug products or our competitors' drug products in China, the U.S. and other foreign countries, including the effect of government initiatives in China, particularly the Chinese government\u2019s increasing regulation of the pharmaceutical industry through anti-corruption activities;\n\u00b7\ncompliance by our employees and agents with regulations that are applicable to sales and marketing activities, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, some of which may result from undertaking new clinical development projects, or from licensing or acquisition-related expenses including up-front fees, milestone payments, and other items;\n\u00b7\nannouncement and completion of corporate acquisition, merger, licensing or marketing arrangements, or sales of assets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in assessments of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nprogress and results of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ntiming and achievement of our corporate objectives;\n\u00b7\ncharges related to expired inventory or bad debt;\n\u00b7\nterminations of, or changes in our agreements or relationships with collaborative partners;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the composition of our management team or Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated increases in our G&A expense due to legal and accounting expenses, including expenses relating to strategic initiatives, or arising out of matters relating to any additional or uncorrected control deficiency or related matters;\n\u00b7\neconomic and political conditions in the U.S. or abroad, particularly in China;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations between the RMB and U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) including recent RMB devaluation that has led to, and may continue to lead to, downward adjustments in our importer price if further devaluation continues;\n\u00b7\nbroad financial market fluctuations in the U.S., Europe or Asia;\n\u00b7\nmore aggressive action by the government in the U.S., China or other foreign jurisdictions in changing taxation policy; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated changes in key personnel.\nWe have acquired products, product licenses and other companies in the past and expect to continue such acquisitions. We may not realize all the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions due to various risks, including risks similar to those stated above as well as to risks that could result if we:\n\u00b7\nissue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nassume liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nrecord goodwill and intangible assets that would be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u00b7\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\nincur large and immediate write-offs of in-process research and development costs; or become subject to litigation.\nOur revenue is substantially dependent on our sales of ZADAXIN in China and competition or other factors could adversely affect our sales.\nOur product revenue is highly dependent on the sales of ZADAXIN in China. We anticipate that sales of ZADAXIN will continue to be a majority of our revenue for at least the next two years. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 95%, 96% and 96% of our ZADAXIN sales, respectively, were to customers in China. Sales of ZADAXIN in China may be limited due to the low average personal income, lack of patient cost reimbursement, poorly developed infrastructure and competition from other products, including generics. ZADAXIN sales growth in recent years has benefited from the rapidly growing Chinese economy and growing personal disposable income. Sales of ZADAXIN in China could be adversely affected by a slowing or downturn of the Chinese economy and from the recent and future decisions of provincial agencies\u2019 pricing reform. Any decrease in the sales of ZADAXIN in China may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nIn China, ZADAXIN is approved for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (\u201cHBV\u201d) and as an immune system enhancer. We face competition from pharmaceutical companies who are aggressively marketing competing products for the treatment of HBV and for other indications where we believe ZADAXIN may be used on an off-label basis. In addition, several local companies are selling lower-priced, locally manufactured generic thymalfasin, which is a competitive product and is selling in substantial and increasing quantities. While generic products outsell ZADAXIN in unit volumes, we have been able to maintain a pricing advantage through the reputation of our imported, branded product. We believe such competition will continue with added new local manufacturers of generic thymalfasin and there could be a negative impact on the price and the volume of ZADAXIN sold in China, which would harm our business.\nSales of ZADAXIN may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to financing limitations on importers, changes in inventory levels at our customers, and surges in sales and inventories. Importers and distributors of ZADAXIN borrow funds in China from banks to purchase, hold and distribute ZADAXIN. Substantial increases in restrictions on fund availability and/or increases in borrowing costs could limit the ability of our importers and distributors to finance their import and distribution process. Additionally, in the past, there have been situations where our suppliers or customers hold a higher level of inventory than expected, which decreased demand for ZADAXIN during that period. Further, our customers tend to purchase large orders, and inventory levels may fluctuate significantly as a result, or as a result of changes in the distribution channel, potentially affecting quarterly periodic results. Fluctuation in our sales of ZADAXIN may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are attempting to expand our business beyond ZADAXIN and outside of China. However, our efforts to in-license or acquire other pharmaceutical products for marketing in China and other markets may be unsuccessful or even if successful may not have a meaningful effect on our dependence on ZADAXIN sales in those markets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur revenues are dependent on our obtaining or maintaining regulatory licenses and compliance with other country-specific regulations, including renewing our drug import license for ZADAXIN, and compliance with the Chinese Pharmacopeia.\nOur revenue is dependent on receipt and maintenance of regulatory licenses and compliance with other country-specific regulations. For example, we have received regulatory approvals to import and market ZADAXIN in China and to manufacture ZADAXIN and export the product from Italy. In order to continue our sales to China, we need to maintain these approvals, known as Import Drug Licenses which allow for the importation and commercial sale of a product manufactured outside of China. Our Import Drug License for ZADAXIN needs to be renewed every five years and the next renewal is required before December 2017 in order for us to continue our ability to import and sell ZADAXIN into China. Although Import Drug License renewals in the past were obtained successfully, there is no assurance that SciClone will receive renewals in the future when applied for or that the renewals will not be conditioned or limited in ways that limit our ability to import and sell ZADAXIN into China.\nOur licenses to manufacture and export ZADAXIN from Italy are dependent upon our continuing compliance with regulations in Italy. Our business would be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain these approvals. In order to sell ZADAXIN to the licensed importers in China, our manufacturers must 1) be approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (\u201cAIFA\u201d) and 2) be accepted by the CFDA. Some manufacturing changes may require: 1) approval by AIFA in Italy and/or 2) acceptance by the CFDA. ZADAXIN registration in Italy has been essential to the renewal of our Import Drug License from the CFDA permitting the importation of ZADAXIN into China.\nOur ability to obtain a renewal of our Import Drug License from the CFDA could be adversely affected due to changes in policies and practices at CFDA in the review process, including with respect to potential requirements for additional technical information regarding ZADAXIN to CFDA.\nThe CFDA, AIFA and other regulatory agencies may, and have, changed their internal administrative rules in ways that may delay or complicate the regulatory approval process. Those changes are not always disclosed or known to us and we may experience unexpected delays or additional costs as a result of such changes. Any change in our ability to obtain or renew regulatory licenses or approvals could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation in the jurisdictions where they are sold, including the standards established by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, or ChP, in China. The ChP is an official compendium of drugs in China and sets the standards of purity, description, test, dosage, precaution, storage and the strength for each drug in China. If our products fail to meet relevant specifications, including ChP specifications, during routine customs testing as such specifications may be revised from time to time, our Import Drug Licenses, which allow the importation for commercial sale, may be revoked, which would result in a significant loss of revenue and materially adversely affect our business.\nChinese provincial government regulations mandating price controls have been imposed on ZADAXIN and several of our other products. If we experience difficulties in our sales efforts as a result of price restrictions or other policies intended to reduce health care costs, our operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nOur products are subject to increasing pricing pressures, particularly in China. Government regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies.\n\ufeff\nThe Chinese government is increasing its efforts to reduce overall health care costs, including pricing controls on pharmaceutical products. Individual provinces in China and, in some cases, individual hospitals can and have established pricing requirements for a product to be included on formulary lists or imposed price reductions as part of the provincial tender process. In some cases, these price limits have been significantly lower than prices at which our distributors have been selling ZADAXIN, in which case we have been removed from formulary lists, which consequently has reduced sales to certain hospitals and could adversely affect our future sales.\nRecent governmental policy changes in China have eliminated national regulation of the maximum retail drug prices for most drugs, effective June 1, 2015. Decisions by provincial authorities are emerging as the primary governmental mechanism for price controls. As an example, the Zhejiang provincial authority announced a price limitation for sales of ZADAXIN in the province in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nApril 2015 that became effective in May 2015. However, we were able to mitigate, in part, the impact of this price limitation by sharing the burden of the price reduction with our distributor.\nThe pricing regulations in China, whether operating at a national, provincial or institutional level, as well as regulation of the importation of pharmaceutical products, have reduced retail prices of, and our own revenue from, ZADAXIN and our other products, and we expect that pricing pressure will continue. While the regulatory mechanisms are changing and the ultimate outcome is uncertain, and while we have been able to mitigate the impact of prior price reductions on our overall business, prices could be reduced to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market, limit the volume of product which may be imported and sold or place high import duties on the product, any of which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline.\nOther emerging measures intended to reduce health care costs may also adversely affect our sales. Chinese provincial or local government agencies may limit or prohibit the use of pharmaceuticals they consider to be and designate as adjuvants as part of a policy to reduce spending on pharmaceuticals. None of our products has received such a designation to date from Chinese provincial or local government agencies. A few hospitals have designated our product as an adjuvant, but our revenues have not been materially affected. However, if any of our products are designated as an adjuvant by governments or local agencies in provinces where we have significant sales, or in hospitals where we have significant sales, sales of that product in such locations or hospitals would be significantly adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that our business development activities will result in pursuing or completing a particular transaction.\nIn early February 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had initiated a process to identify, examine and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to us with a view to enhancing stockholder value. In July 2016, we announced that our Board was no longer continuing active discussions with potential acquirers which were undertaken as part of its strategic review process and that the Board will continue to evaluate additional strategic opportunities while continuing to focus on growing the Company's business. This announcement had adverse effects on our stock price, and may have adverse effects on our customer relationships and retention of key employees.\nWe expect to continue to review strategic opportunities, including through collaborations, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, equity- or debt-based investments, mergers and acquisitions. However, these activities are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunities, competition from other companies that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all, and integrate acquisitions. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions, we may not accurately assess the risks and uncertainties associated with engaging or not engaging in a strategic opportunity, and the anticipated benefits from pursuing any such opportunity may not materialize. In addition, undertaking substantial transactions or multiple transactions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business, potentially having adverse effects on our existing business relationships and our key employees. In addition, there can be no assurance that the evaluation of potential transactions will result in either pursuing any different strategic operational approach or completing any particular transaction.\nIf we fail to achieve or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to protect from fraudulent, illegal or unauthorized transactions. If we cannot establish effective controls and provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. Moreover, as a U.S.-based corporation doing business internationally, these controls often need to satisfy the requirements of foreign law as well as the requirements of U.S. law which frequently differ in certain aspects. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, in 2012, our management identified two separate instances of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which were fully remediated prior to December 31, 2014. We continuously work on improvements to our internal controls and there can be no assurance that these or other material weaknesses will not occur in the future, or otherwise cause us to inaccurately report our financial statements. For example, the restatement of our financial statements for each of our first, second, and third quarters of 2012, and our financial statements for each of the second and third quarters of 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2011, were in part caused by\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe material weakness related to the design and operation of our controls disclosed as of December 31, 2012 discussed above. Any failure to implement and maintain controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to improve our internal controls or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption and similar laws, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to fully comply with such regulations and laws.\nWe are subject to U.S., Chinese and other foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations. As a U.S. reporting company, we are subject to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA has been interpreted to include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations and the Chinese government in particular has increased its anti-corruption measures, particularly in the pharmaceutical and health care markets.\nIn 2010 the SEC and DOJ commenced investigations of the Company regarding a range of matters, including the possibility of violations of the FCPA, primarily related to certain historical sales and marketing activities with respect to our China operations. A Special Committee of our Board undertook an independent investigation as to matters reflected in and arising from the SEC and DOJ investigations in order to evaluate whether any violation of the FCPA or other laws occurred. In 2016, we announced a settlement agreement with the SEC fully resolving the SEC\u2019s investigation into possible violations of the FCPA. The DOJ has also completed its investigation and has declined to pursue any action. Under the terms of the settlement with the SEC, we paid to the SEC a total of $12.8 million, including disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and a penalty as final settlement. We are also required to give status reports to the SEC through the first quarter of 2019 on our continued remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures.\nWe expended substantial resources on the investigations and our internal remediation and compliance efforts, and continue to expend substantial resources on compliance. However, given the high level of complexity of the anti-bribery laws, there is a risk that we may inadvertently breach these regulations, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with record keeping requirements, or otherwise. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate risks and manage compliance through policies, procedures and internal controls. We have a large, dispersed sales force and we use third-party agents as well as distributors in various aspects of our business, which presents risks to our effort to ensure that our practices comply with anti-bribery and similar regulations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm serving as our external auditor is an audit firm which is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), and, although they may be subject to other inspections, you do not have the benefits of PCAOB inspections.\nOur incumbent independent auditors\u2019 system of quality control and their individual audits are subject to review, inspection, or other outside assurance from time to time by member firms in the network of firms to which they belong, by peer accounting firms, or by regulatory or industry bodies in China (such as China\u2019s securities regulator or the Chinese body representing certified public accountants). However, these various bodies or parties are distinct from the PCAOB, and their efforts may not be concentrated on audits of SEC registrants. Their reviews or inspections may be substantially different, or not comparable to, an inspection by the PCAOB. Auditors of companies that are registered with the SEC and traded publicly in the U.S., including our independent registered public accounting firm, must be registered with the PCAOB, and are required by the laws of the U.S. to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. Because our auditors are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating audits and quality control procedures of any auditors operating in China, including our auditors. As a result, investors in our equity securities may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to other public company auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. As a result, investors in our stock may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProceedings instituted by the SEC against certain PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nIn December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in China, alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based related companies under investigation by the SEC. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February 12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms, including our registered public accounting firm, appealed to the SEC against this sanction decision. In February 2015, the four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay $500,000 each to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission. If the firms don\u2019t follow the procedures, the SEC could impose penalties such as suspensions, or it could restart the current enforcement case administrative proceedings.\nIn the event that the SEC restarts the enforcement administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the U.S. with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, U.S.-listed companies and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm were denied the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our shares from the NASDAQ Global Select Market or deregistration by the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our stock in the U.S.\nWe may incur unexpected charges relating to our operations.\nAlthough we have generally experienced minimal product returns and our customers have historically paid all invoiced amounts, we could incur future charges relating to inventory that expires or as a result of customer failures to pay invoiced amounts timely or in full. For example, from time to time we have recorded bad debt expense or write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable. While the amounts of the write offs have historically been immaterial, we may have more significant bad debt expenses or write offs in the future. We have had and could also experience additional charges for potential inventory obsolescence related to other products if we are unable to sell units that are nearing their expiration dates, or for bad debt if other distributors do not pay outstanding receivables in full. Those or similar future events would have an adverse impact upon our operating results.\nWe are at risk of additional securities class action and derivative lawsuits.\nSecurities class action and derivative lawsuits are often filed against public companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. After our announcement regarding SEC and DOJ investigations in 2010, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as parties in purported stockholder class actions and derivative lawsuits. Those class action lawsuits were dismissed and we have settled those derivative lawsuits. Our stock price declined following the announcement of a restatement of our financial statements for fiscal 2011 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, and that our predecessor independent auditing firm had elected not to stand for reappointment for the 2013 fiscal year. Soon after that announcement, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as parties in a purported derivative lawsuit relating to the restatement, which was subsequently dismissed in its entirety. We may experience stock price volatility in the future related to other matters. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years. We may be named in additional litigation, which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such litigation could result in additional substantial costs and a diversion of management's and the Board of Directors\u2019 attention and resources, which could harm our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nWe have numerous product candidates under development, some of which we own and others which were in-licensed to us.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that our product candidates are ineffective or have unanticipated side effects and/or drug interactions that may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval. The regulatory approval processes in the U.S., Europe and China are demanding, lengthy and expensive. We have committed significant resources, including capital and time, to develop and seek approval for products under development, and if we do not obtain approvals we are seeking, we may be unable to achieve any revenue from these products. All new drugs, including our product candidates, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, CFDA and similar regulatory agencies. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, importation, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. These regulations may change from time to time and new regulations may be adopted.\nSatisfaction of government regulations may take several years and the time needed to satisfy them varies substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. As a result, government regulation may cause us to delay the introduction of, or prevent us from marketing, our existing or potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We have experienced delays in the regulatory process, and there exists risk that we may not receive approval of in-licensed products currently in the regulatory process.\nTo fully develop these products and other products we may acquire, substantial resources are required for extensive research, development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, and manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to the potential products being ready for sale. We cannot assure that our efforts will produce commercially viable products. We are obligated to make a milestone payment upon regulatory approval of certain products under development. If any of our products, even if developed and approved, cannot be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, our business will be harmed and the price of our stock may decline.\nMarket acceptance of any product that is successfully developed and approved will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince prospective customers to use our products as an alternative to other treatments and therapies. In addition, doctors must opt to use treatments involving our products. If doctors elect to use a different course of treatment, demand for our drug products would be reduced. In addition, for certain products we may need to convince partners to manufacture or market our products. Our success will also depend upon pricing restrictions and reimbursement policies that will be imposed, and upon our ability to properly anticipate those. Failure to do any of the above will lead to an unfavorable outcome on the results of our operations.\nOur sales are concentrated in China and we face risks relating to operating in China, including risks due to changes in the regulatory environment, slow payment cycles and exposure to fluctuations in the Chinese economy.\nA significant portion of our revenue and profit is derived from operations in China. Consequently, our overall financial results are dependent on this market, and our business is exposed to risks there. A downturn in the Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition to the risks relating to pricing previously discussed above, these risks also include changes in economic conditions (including wage and cost inflation, currency exchange rates, consumer spending and employment levels), tax rates, laws, changes in the regulatory environment, increased competition and potential noncompliance with local laws and regulations. Risks also include changing consumer product preferences and preferred sales channels, as well as our ability to accommodate such changing preferences. Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. Any significant or prolonged deterioration in China\u2019s relations with the United States and other countries could adversely affect our China business. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China. There can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such risks and uncertainties on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe experience other issues with managing sales operations in China including long payment cycles, potential difficulties in timely accounts receivable collection and, especially from significant customers, fluctuations in the timing and amount of orders and the adverse effect of any of these issues on our business could be increased due to the concentration of our business with a small number of distributors. Problems with collections from, or sales to, any one of those distributors could materially adversely affect our results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law and regulatory interpretations, including changes affecting the taxation by the U.S. of income earned outside the U.S. that may result from pending and possible future proposals), competition laws, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted in and may continue to result in additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and costs are increasing as a result of this uncertainty and other factors. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has and may continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nCurrently all of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on certain undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. The U.S. government may propose initiatives that would substantially reduce our ability to defer U.S. taxes including: repealing deferral of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings, eliminating utilization or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. If any of these proposals are constituted into legislation, they could increase our U.S. income tax liability and as a result have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause of China's tiered method of importing and distributing finished pharmaceutical products, our quarterly results may vary substantially from one period to the next; we are dependent upon Sinopharm as the exclusive importer of ZADAXIN.\nImported products in China, including ZADAXIN and other imported products, are distributed through a tiered method to import and distribute finished pharmaceutical products. Promoted products are typically sold from our partner companies within China to the primary distributor with the following distribution being the same for imported as well as promoted products. At each port of entry, and prior to moving the product forward to the distributors, government-licensed importing agents must process and evaluate each imported product shipment to determine whether it satisfies China's quality assurance requirements. In order to efficiently manage this process, the importing agents typically place large, and therefore relatively few, orders within an annual period. Therefore, sales to an importing agent can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the size and timing of the orders, which has in the past and may in the future cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. We rely on Sinopharm to supply our ZADAXIN sales in China. Our receivables from Sinopharm are material, and if we were unable to collect receivables from Sinopharm or any other importer, our business and cash-flow would be adversely affected.\nGenerally, our importers are not obligated to place purchase orders for our product, and if they determined for any reason not to place purchase orders, we would need to seek alternative licensed importers, which could cause fluctuations in our revenue. As a result of our agreement granting certain exclusive importation rights to Sinopharm for ZADAXIN, we are dependent upon Sinopharm\u2019s performance of its obligations under that agreement. We have a long-standing and, we believe excellent, relationship with Sinopharm; however, if Sinopharm were unable to adequately perform its obligations under, or breached, the agreement our business would be adversely affected.\nThe existence of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in China\u2019s pharmaceutical retail market may damage our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain medicine products distributed or sold in China\u2019s pharmaceutical retail market, including those appearing to be ZADAXIN, may be counterfeit. Counterfeit products are products sold under the same or very similar brand names and/or have a similar appearance to genuine products. Counterfeit products, including counterfeit pharmaceutical products, are a significant problem in China and we have experienced counterfeiting of ZADAXIN. Such counterfeit products divert sales from genuine products, often are of lower cost, often are of lower quality (having different ingredients or formulations, for example), and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. The counterfeit pharmaceutical product regulation control and enforcement system in China is not able to completely eliminate production and sale of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. To\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincrease our ability to prevent counterfeiting, we have taken several actions, including enhancements of our ZADAXIN product labeling to implement industry-leading labeling technology and implementation of product tracking applications. However we cannot eliminate counterfeiting and, any sale of counterfeit products resulting in adverse side effects to consumers may subject us to negative publicity and expenses. It could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAlthough our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Our profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls.\nThe majority of our sales through June 30, 2016 were in U.S. dollars, although a portion of our sales were denominated in RMB. Per our previous contractual arrangement with Sinopharm through December 31, 2015, and a renewed contractual arrangement with Sinopharm (our sole importer and distributor for ZADAXIN in China) which took effect January 1, 2016, our sales of ZADAXIN to Sinopharm were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the established importer price could be adjusted quarterly based upon exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and RMB. Effective July 1, 2016, sales to Sinopharm are and will be denominated in RMB, linking our sales directly to the foreign currency (as opposed to a less-correlated basis via lagging adjustments). In recent months the RMB has experienced devaluation exposing us to increased foreign exchange risk and our revenues were adversely impacted by those fluctuations in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in U.S. dollars and euros and costs of our marketing efforts in China are paid in local currency. In addition, we have certain cash balances and other assets and liabilities denominated in euros, RMB and Hong Kong dollars. A stronger U.S. dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the local currency would tend to have an adverse effect on sales and potentially on collection of accounts receivable and a positive effect on expenses. China currently maintains the value of the RMB in a narrow currency trading band that may or may not fluctuate based on government policy. For example, in August 2015, the Chinese government devalued the RMB and may further devalue the RMB at any time. This devaluation has resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and may reflect a weakening of the Chinese economy. Depending on market conditions and the state of the Chinese economy, China has intervened in the foreign exchange market in the past to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate, and it could make future adjustments, including moving to a managed float system, with opportunistic interventions. This reserve diversification may negatively impact the U.S. dollar and U.S. interest rates. Changes in exchange rates could unpredictably and adversely affect our operating results and could result in exchange losses. To date, we have not hedged against the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and stock price.\nWe cannot predict the safety profile of the use of ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market particularly when used in combination with other drugs.\nWhile ZADAXIN has an excellent safety profile, we cannot predict whether ZADAXIN or any product we market may have unexpected safety issues in a particular patient population or when used in new indications. In addition, we cannot predict how ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market will work with other drugs, including causing possible adverse side effects not directly attributable to the other drugs that could compromise the safety profile of ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop or market when used in certain combination therapies. We are exploring new indications for ZADAXIN and there is a risk that new safety issues could appear in these new patient populations.\nAs we introduce new products, there may be adverse safety events related to those products. Adverse safety events may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproducts or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales or stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nIf third-party reimbursement is not available or patients cannot otherwise pay for ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop, we may not be able to successfully market them.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of therapeutic products, such as ZADAXIN or other drugs we may develop. We cannot assure you that third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products we might develop. Although ZADAXIN receives some limited reimbursement in China, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing reimbursements or increase third-party payments for ZADAXIN or obtain third-party payments for other products that we sell or develop in China. The failure to maintain third-party reimbursement for our products would harm our business. In many emerging markets where we have marketing rights to ZADAXIN, but where government resources and per capita income may be so low that our products will be prohibitively expensive, we may not be able to market our products on economically favorable terms, if at all.\nRecent efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce health care costs and the announcement of legislative proposals and reforms to implement government controls has caused us to reduce the prices at which we market our drugs in China, and additional reforms, if they were to occur, could cause us to further reduce our prices which could reduce our gross margins and may harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties who are our sole source suppliers for our clinical trial and commercial products and their inability to deliver products that meet our quality-control standards could delay or harm one or more important areas of our business including our sales, clinical trials or the regulatory approval process.\nWe rely on third parties, who are subject to regulatory oversight, to supply our commercial products. Any deficiencies or shortages in supply of our commercial products would adversely affect our ability to realize our sales plans. For example, the manufacturing of the raw material and the processing to finished product of ZADAXIN is done in few batches in any given three-month period and any manufacturing errors have the potential to require a product recall. We currently have only one approved finished vial manufacturer and two approved active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) suppliers. Similarly, ONXEO (formerly BioAlliance) is the sole supplier of Loramyc and each of the products that are marketed through our NovaMed Shanghai and our SciClone Pharmaceuticals (Jiangsu) Co. Ltd. subsidiaries are manufactured by, or obtained from, a single source.\nIf we experience a problem with a sole source manufacturer or our suppliers, our sales may suffer. We have experienced difficulties with obtaining product from manufacturers in the past. In addition, manufacturing interruptions or failure to comply with regulatory requirements by suppliers of our product candidates in clinical trial, or other could delay the trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data and its potential use in future regulatory filings.\nDuring 2012, we experienced limitations on supply of several products we were promoting (each of which we no longer market) and the growth in the sales of those products was affected. During 2011, we experienced manufacturing delays related to repairs for general, non-production-related facilities equipment at one of our API suppliers. During 2010, we experienced difficulties validating upgrades to equipment with one of our API manufacturers. Although we are taking steps to ensure that such problems do not continue, there is no assurance that we will either be successful in doing so with our current supplier or be able to timely and cost-effectively qualify new suppliers for this component.\nIf our thymalfasin API or ZADAXIN products are not shipped and stored at precision temperatures, the products could become damaged, which could negatively affect our sales and operating results.\nThymalfasin API and ZADAXIN are temperature sensitive products. SciClone relies on third-party organizations to provide controlled temperature shipping logistics services from the point of ownership transfer from the API contract manufacturer to the point where thymalfasin API is converted to ZADAXIN drug product, and from the ZADAXIN drug product manufacturing site to our storage locations in Hong Kong and then to China. Although some temperature excursions are allowable and thymalfasin and ZADAXIN are relatively stable when exposed to temperatures higher than recommended, if any third-party logistics or equipment provider fails to perform their required oversight duties with respect to temperature control or a shipment is delayed in transit for a prolonged period of time, the thymalfasin API or ZADAXIN drug product could become unsuitable for subsequent processing or commercial use. Although we have not experienced cold chain interruptions in the past and our distributor in China may maintain several months supply of our product, were our cold chain distribution or warehouse capability to be interrupted, our ability to timely\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndeliver finished product to China could be adversely affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe rely on third parties for development, commercialization and other aspects of our business, and the inability of any of these parties to reliably, timely or cost-effectively provide us with their obligated services could materially harm the timing of bringing our products to market and accordingly adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties, such as collaboration partners, contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators, and contract laboratories, in the research and development of our product candidates and in the conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates. We are also dependent upon third parties for the commercialization or distribution of products or product candidates. If these parties, whom we do not control, do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if our collaboration partners do not have the ability or the resources to successfully complete their objectives, or choose not to continue their relationship with us, our development efforts could be delayed, suspended or terminated, or our commercialization efforts may be delayed, impaired or terminated. If the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain by third parties is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical or clinical activities could be delayed and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nOur rights to develop, market and sell our products and future product candidates are held under license and other agreements, and the third parties to those agreements might elect not to renew them.\nExcept for ZADAXIN, our rights to develop, market and sell our products including licensed products and products currently promoted or sold, are held by us under license, promotion, distribution or marketing agreements with third parties. These agreements for products include products in the regulatory review process, including products in clinical trials that are held under license, distribution or marketing agreements. In addition, our success in the future may be dependent on entering into similar agreements with other parties and the renewal of any such agreements. The third parties to these agreements are generally not under an obligation to renew the agreements, and in some cases have not renewed the agreements, which has affected our revenues. If any of these agreements are terminated, or if they are not renewed, our ability to develop or distribute the products or product candidates could be terminated and our business could be affected.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain additional, highly skilled and experienced personnel, including the ability to expand our sales staff, our business will suffer.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the specialized, scientific and worldwide nature of our business. We are also dependent on our ability to appropriately staff these personnel in appropriate positions as our business fluctuates. Further, our efforts to in-license or acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates in current or new jurisdictions may require the addition of clinical and regulatory personnel and the expansion of, or changes in our sales and marketing operation. In addition, we assign numerous key responsibilities to a limited number of individuals, and we would experience difficulty in finding immediate replacements for any of them were any one of them to choose to leave employment with us. There is intense competition for qualified management, scientific, clinical, regulatory, and sales and marketing personnel in the pharmaceutical industry.\nThere is significant turnover in the industry, in China in particular, and we have also experienced turnover in our sales personnel and key employees. We may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to grow and develop our business globally.\nWe have terminated personnel for violations of our policies and procedures as well as for lack of performance. Our future success will depend in part on our retaining key personnel and on recruiting additional senior sales and other personnel in China. We are continuously recruiting executives and other level personnel to address departures and to expand and strengthen our China operations.\nConversely, if we need to reduce the size of a particular aspect of our business, including if we have contracts that are not renewed or renegotiated for products we market or promote, we are also dependent on our ability to make such adjustments while retaining suitably skilled personnel. If we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed or promptly replace those employees who are critical to our sales, development and other operations, and in particular senior executives, our financial results and operations would be adversely affected. At this time, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance for any of our personnel.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may need to obtain additional funding to support our long-term product development, including funding of in-licensed products, and commercialization programs.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months. We may use cash to acquire additional product rights or for future acquisitions. Our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is dependent on numerous factors including our ability to achieve increasing sales of ZADAXIN in China, and for our other products and the execution and successful completion of clinical trials in China. Further, we may use cash to fund products we in-license. We cannot assure you that such funds from operating activities will be sufficient, or that we will attain profitable operations in future periods. In addition, we intend to develop other products and we may need additional funds in the future to support such development and to support future growth and achieve profitability. If we need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds are not available on reasonable terms, if at all, our commercialization efforts may be impeded, our revenues may be limited and our operating results may suffer.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased income taxes which could reduce our future income.\nWe have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in countries where:\n\u00b7\ntax incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment; or\n\u00b7\nincome tax rates are low.\nOur taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and China. In determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur. However, we cannot be certain that the final determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax provision, operating results, financial position and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur taxes could also increase if our ability to defer U.S. federal taxes under current tax laws were to change as a result of changes in tax law that prevent us from asserting indefinite reinvestment of offshore undistributed earnings or as a result of a change in our intention regarding distribution of these offshore undistributed earnings.\nIf we fail to protect our products, technologies and trade secrets, we may not be able to successfully use, manufacture, market or sell our products, or we may fail to advance or maintain our competitive position, and we have limited intellectual property protection in China.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products and technologies and to preserve our trade secrets. Our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the future. Our patents or patent applications may not have priority over others' applications. Our existing patents and additional patents that may be issued, if any, may not provide a competitive advantage to us or may be invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. Others may independently develop similar products or design around patents issued or licensed to us. Patents issued to, or patent applications filed by, other companies could harm our ability to use, manufacture, market or sell our products or maintain our competitive position with respect to our products. Although many of our patents relating to thymalfasin have expired, including composition of matter patents, we have rights to other patents and patent applications relating to thymalfasin and thymalfasin analogues, including method of use patents with respect to the use of thymalfasin for certain indications. Additionally, thymalfasin has received Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. for the treatment of stage 2b through stage 4 melanoma, for the treatment of chronic active hepatitis B, for the treatment of DiGeorge anomaly with immune defects, and for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. If other parties develop generic forms of thymalfasin for other indications, including conducting clinical trials for such indications, our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing and selling such generic forms of thymalfasin or their brands of thymalfasin. If other parties develop analogues or derivatives of thymalfasin, our patents and other rights might not be sufficient to prohibit them from marketing these analogues or derivatives.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPharmaceutical products are either not patentable or have only recently become patentable in some of the countries in which we market or may market thymalfasin. We do not have composition patent claims directed to the thymalfasin that is currently marketed in China, our largest market, although we do have other type of patent claims, pending or issued, directed to other aspects of thymalfasin therapy. Other companies market generic thymalfasin in China, potentially in violation of our patent, trademark or other rights which, to date, we have defended by informing physicians and hospitals of the practice. Past enforcement of intellectual property rights in many of these countries, including China in particular, has been limited or non-existent. Future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country. Claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation, so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions.\nIf we are involved in intellectual property claims and litigation, the proceedings may divert our resources and subject us to significant liability for damages, substantial litigation expense and the loss of our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our not infringing valid, enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties, and not breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products. In addition, we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make, use or sell any of our potential products. For example, U.S. patent applications may be kept confidential for 12 or more months while pending in the Patent and Trademark Office, and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published nine months or more after filing. It is possible that we may unintentionally infringe these patents or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may in the future receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third-party patents. Any legal action against us or our collaborative partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes affected by third-party rights may require us or our collaborative partners to obtain licenses in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes. Our efforts to defend against any of these claims, regardless of merit, would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans. In addition, these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages. We or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection.\nIf other companies obtain patents with conflicting claims, we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternate technology to manufacture or market the affected products and processes. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms or at all. Any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products. Our efforts to defend against any of these claims would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans.\nWe may need to initiate litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive, to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others' rights. If litigation results, a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor's rights. If any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology we also have invented, the Patent and Trademark Office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology. These actions may subject us to potential liability for damages. We or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nSubstantial sales of our stock or securities convertible into shares of our stock or the exercise or conversion of options may impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities convertible into our common stock to fund acquisitions, finance operations and for other purposes. Future issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Similarly, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock or sell equity in a subsidiary, the percentage ownership of our present stockholders of the respective entities will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investment in common stock are subject to certain risks which could materially adversely affect our overall financial position.\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with an established internal policy and customarily in instruments which historically have been highly liquid and carried relatively low risk. However, in recent years, similar types of investments have experienced losses in value or liquidity issues which differ from their historical pattern. For example, we routinely have invested in money market funds with large financial institutions. One or more of these funds could experience losses or liquidity problems and, although to date some of the largest financial institutions who sponsor such funds have offset similar losses, there is no assurance that our financial institutions would either not incur losses or would offset any losses were they to occur.\nAny adjustment to decrease the ratings of our investments by a statistical rating organization (such as Moody\u2019s or Standard and Poor\u2019s) may have a negative impact on the value of our investments.\nShould any of our cash investments permanently lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it would have a material and adverse effect on our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise and such financing may not be available on commercially attractive terms.\nIf our common stock investment in Soligenix were to permanently lose value on an other than temporary basis, our financial position could be negatively impacted with a charge to operations.\nIn addition, financial instruments may subject us to a concentration of credit risk. Most of our cash and cash equivalents are held by a limited number of financial institutions. To date, we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents. However, if any of these instruments permanently lost value or have their liquidity impaired, it would also have a material and adverse effect on our overall financial position by imperiling our ability to fund our operations and forcing us to seek additional financing sooner than we would otherwise and such financing may not be available on commercially attractive terms.\nWe expect that we may need to transfer capital to certain of our China subsidiaries from time to time to fund their operations. We need to obtain regulatory approval from China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) in order to make such transfers and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner. We were able to fund the operations of NovaMed Shanghai to date through commercial credit facilities or through intercompany loans, but we could face difficulties in the future if our efforts to improve profitability and cash flow in NovaMed Shanghai or our other China subsidiaries are not successful, or if we are unable to obtain SAFE approval or obtain further funding for them.\nFurthermore, a majority of our cash is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Such cash is used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 2016. We plan to repatriate a portion of expected foreign earnings to be generated in future years to fund our U.S. operations. We have provided for U.S. income taxes on a portion of recent years\u2019 foreign earnings that we have repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries, and our annual effective tax rate for the respective periods reflects both the provisions as well as benefits associated with our operations. We plan to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. remaining unrepatriated future foreign earnings expected to be generated in 2017 and beyond.\nOur loans receivable are subject to certain risks which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nAs part of our May 2013 license and supply agreement with Zensun, we agreed to loan up to $12 million to Zensun, of which $12 million had been loaned as of December 31, 2016. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes by Zensun. As security for the loan agreements, Zensun pledged its entire equity interest in its subsidiary Shanghai Dongxin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (whose assets include real property) to us. If the real property which comprises the majority of the value of all of the assets pledged as security were to suffer a decrease in its value due to macroeconomic conditions or local market-specific factors impacting commercial real estate market values, such a fact may represent an indication of loan impairment. If these loans were to become impaired and the loans could not be collected, our financial position could be negatively impacted with a charge to operations for the amount of any unpaid principal and interest.\nOur ability to utilize our tax attributes may be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes, such as our U.S. federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and our tax credit carryforwards, may be substantially restricted if we have had in the past, or have in the future, an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSection 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. An ownership change occurs if increases in the percentage of our stock held by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382, which provides that certain public groups can be treated as 5-percent shareholders) collectively exceed more than fifty percent, comparing the lowest percentage of stock owned by each 5-percent shareholder at any time during the testing period (which is generally a three-year rolling period) to the percentage of stock owned by the 5-percent shareholder immediately after the close of any owner shift testing date. Our repurchases of our common stock, issuances of any additional significant amounts of our common stock for future acquisitions or other transactions and trading in our stock by stockholders, may have increased the possibility that in the future we could experience an ownership change. Trading by our stockholders, stock repurchases or other transactions could, in the future, cause an ownership change, resulting in an annual limitation on utilization of our tax attributes. If our tax attribute usage is subject to limitation and if we are profitable, our future cash flows could be adversely affected due to an increased tax liability.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our charter documents contain certain anti-takeover provisions, including provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders may not cumulate votes, stockholders' meetings may be called by stockholders only if they hold 25% or more of our common stock and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue 10 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by the stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, the Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company. Although our Rights Agreement dated December 19, 2006 expired on its scheduled expiration date of December 19, 2016, our Board of Directors could adopt another rights plan with anti-takeover effects in the future. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of stockholders.\nThe actions of stockholders could adversely affect our business. Specifically, certain actions of certain types of stockholders, including without limitation public proposals, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or special demands or requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management, directors and employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of our stockholders may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel as well as customers, service providers and partners. Actions by our stockholders may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe may be subject to product liability lawsuits, and our insurance may be inadequate to cover damages.\nClinical trials of any of our current and potential products or the actual commercial sales of our product may expose us to liability claims from the use of these products. We currently carry product liability insurance. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, for clinical and commercial activities, that any insurance we have will cover any particular claim that is asserted, or that the insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall. If we fail to have sufficient coverage, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations, our business may be harmed.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products (including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents), as well as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the experimental use of animals. The extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action in these areas cannot be accurately predicted.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe do not currently maintain hazardous materials at our facilities. While we outsource our research and development programs involving the controlled use of biohazardous materials, if in the future we conduct these programs ourselves, we might be required to incur significant cost to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Further, in the event of an accident, we would be liable for any damages that result, and the liability could exceed our resources.\nOur business and operations are subject to the risks of being based in particular locations known for earthquakes, other natural catastrophic disasters and service interruptions.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Although we maintain a disaster recovery policy that includes storage of important corporate data in a different geographic region of the U.S., all of our significant corporate data is stored in our headquarters facility and accordingly, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Most of our sales are into China for which we maintain our warehouses for finished goods in Hong Kong, which can experience severe typhoon storms, earthquakes or other natural catastrophic disasters. Although our distributors in China may maintain several months\u2019 supply of our product, were our warehouse capability to be interrupted, either through a natural disaster such as flooding or through a service interruption, such as a lack of electricity to power required air conditioning, our ability to timely deliver finished product to China could be adversely affected which in turn would materially adversely affect our sales and ensuing operating results.\nWe may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity if it were to disrupt the demand, supply or delivery of product, management of our business, or result in cost increases as a result of government regulation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, certain information regarding our business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our computer networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and reputation. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Although we have not been adversely affected in any significant manner, we have experienced problems with information security in the past which we believe is primarily due to breaches of security by current or former employees gaining access to restricted information. Any such breach could compromise our computer networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Although we have purchased cyber liability insurance, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position.", "PERMNO": 77413, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SCLN"}
