{"cik": "1550603", "company": "MALVERN BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe recent global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities and other markets and could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a COVID-19 outbreak was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Since that time, the coronavirus has spread throughout the United States, including in the regions and communities in which the Company operates. In response, many state and local governments, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey, have instituted various emergency restrictions that continue to substantially limit the operation of non-essential businesses and the activities of individuals. These restrictions could result in significant adverse effects on our borrowers and many different types of small and mid-sized businesses within the Company\u2019s client base, particularly those in the retail, hotel, medical, leisure, hospitality and food and beverage industries, among many others, and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions and communities in which we operate.\nThe ultimate effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, including as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns, changes in consumer behavior, business closures, deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the Company (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented), declines in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, branch or office closures and business interruptions.\nThe outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines and shelter in place orders. These measures may continue to remain in place for a significant period of time and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition, as well as the business, operations and financial conditions of our customers and business partners. The spread of the virus has also caused us to modify our business practices (including employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings) in ways that may become detrimental to our business (including working remotely and its attendant cybersecurity risks). We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and customers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nWe are subject to increasing credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. We are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with loans and borrowers. As the overall\neconomic climate in the U.S., generally, and in our market areas specifically, experience material disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our borrowers may have difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 could preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. We are actively working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although recent regulatory guidance provides that such loan modifications are exempt from the calculation and reporting of troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and loan delinquencies, we cannot predict whether such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from COVID-19 could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the FRB lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in certain sectors. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, and financial condition.\nUnpredictable future developments related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Any future development is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios could be materially adversely affected and many of the risks described herein will be heightened.\nOur participation in the SBA PPP loan program exposes us to risks related to noncompliance with the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, which was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP. As of September 30, 2020, the Company obtained approval from the SBA for 255 PPP loans totaling $20.8 million for both existing and new customers, with an average loan size of approximately $81,000. The net deferred fee related to PPP loan origination totaled $609,000 at September 30, 2020. The Company may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which these loans were originated, funded, or serviced. If a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount\nof the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and other factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and in a timely manner. The risks of non-payment and late payments are assessed through our underwriting and loan review procedures based on several factors including credit risks of a particular borrower, changes in economic conditions, the duration of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors. Despite our efforts, we do and will experience loan losses, and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, terrorist acts, or a combination of these or other factors.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions.\nA return to a recessionary period could negatively impact our customers in a manner that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in the housing markets, real estate values and unemployment levels, and the deterioration of economic conditions in our market area, could affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and adversely affect our results of operations and future growth potential in the following ways:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nThe carrying value of our OREO may decline further; and\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest-earning assets, the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by such external factors as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the \u201cFOMC\u201d), and market interest rates.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nWe also attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nOur high concentration of commercial real estate loans exposes us to increased lending risk.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the primary composition of our total loan portfolio was as follows:\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate loans of $498.5 million, or 47.8 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\nresidential real estate loans of $242.1 million, or 23.2 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\ncommercial and industrial loans of $116.6 million, or 11.2 percent of total loans;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development loans of $68.8 million, or 6.6 percent of total loans and\n\u2022\nconsumer loans of $30.7 million, or 2.9 percent of total loans.\nCommercial real estate loans expose us to a greater risk of loss than do residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers or a significant default by our customers would materially and adversely affect us.\nAlthough the economy in our market area generally, and the real estate market in particular, have been relatively strong, we can give you no assurance that it will continue to grow or that the rate of growth will accelerate to historic levels. Many factors could reduce or halt growth in our local economy and real estate market. Accordingly, it may become more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner than in the current economic climate, as commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties. The deterioration of one or a few of our commercial real estate loans could cause a material increase in our level of nonperforming loans, which would result in a loss of revenue from these loans and could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and/or an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our net income. We also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates, which may decrease property values and may reduce the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives. Weaknesses in the commercial real estate market in general could negatively impact our collateral. Any weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans, which could negatively impact our loan portfolio\u2019s performance and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, we could incur material losses. Any of these events could increase our costs, require management time and attention, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the FRB and the OCC have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the joint guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors: (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of total risk-based capital or (ii) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land and loans secured by multifamily and non-owner occupied non-farm residential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) represent 300 percent or more of total risk-based capital and the institution\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 month period. In such event, management should employ heightened risk management practices, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing.\nThe Bank\u2019s total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represented 38.0 percent of risk based capital at September 30, 2020 as compared to 24.7 percent of capital at September 30, 2019. This ratio is\nbelow the regulatory commercial real estate concentration guideline level of 100 percent for land and construction loans. The Bank\u2019s total reported commercial real estate loans to total risk based capital was 335.8 percent at September 30, 2020, as compared to 331.5 percent of capital at September 30, 2019. This ratio is above the regulatory commercial real estate concentration guideline level of 300 percent for all investor real estate loans. The Bank\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 14.6 percent over the preceding 36 months.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgements about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the required amount of the allowance for loan losses, we evaluate certain loans individually and establish loan loss allowances for specifically identified impairments. For all non-impaired loans, including those not individually reviewed, we estimate losses and establish loan loss allowances based upon historical and environmental loss factors. If the assumptions used in our calculation methodology are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in further additions to our allowance. At September 30, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was 1.12 percent of total loans, and 1.14 percent of total loans less PPP loans, which do not require a specific reserve. Significant additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow our growth.\nThe banking and financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive. We may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers. Larger institutions have greater resources and access to capital markets, with higher lending limits, more advanced technology and broader suites of services. Competition at times requires increases in deposit rates and decreases in loan rates, and adversely impact our net interest margin.\nOperational, Compliance and Legal Risks\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $47.1 million. We have historically adopted a conservative investment strategy, with concentrations of securities that are backed by government sponsored enterprises. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nOur growth-oriented business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees or if we lose the services of our senior management team.\nOur ability to manage growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled employees. The unanticipated loss of members of our senior management team, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to execute our strategic goals. Our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships and to hire, train and manage our employees.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard, the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d), that will be effective for the Company and the Bank for fiscal years beginning on October 1, 2023. The CECL standard will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to\nincrease our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding the US Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely affect the business.\nIn 2014, a committee of private-market participants and their regulators (as ex officio members) convened by the FRB, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. In 2017, the ARRC announced Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. Also in 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank announced final plans for the production of SOFR, which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 3, 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions and the political discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of and return on the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, these reforms may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR based products, as well as the Company\u2019s systems and processes.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions, which means it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. Transactions include those in which we lend and borrow money, and enter into derivatives to manage our or our customers\u2019 risk. Risks related to transitioning instruments to a new reference rate or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities could also be impacted upon its discontinuance or if it is limited.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to continue to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021 or shortly before that, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time for preparing for the transition. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The outcome of such consultation and its impact on LIBOR could materially affect the economics as well as the timing of the transition away from LIBOR.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and cyber-attacks, systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Furthermore, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent New Jersey legislative changes may increase our tax expense.\nIn connection with adopting its 2019 fiscal year budget, the New Jersey legislature adopted, and the Governor signed, legislation that imposes a temporary surtax on corporations earning New Jersey allocated income in excess of $1 million of 2.5 percent for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5 percent for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. The legislation also requires combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax privilege periods ending on or after July 31, 2019, changing New Jersey\u2019s current status as a separate return state, and limits the deductibility of dividends received. These changes are not temporary. Regulations implementing the legislative changes have not yet been issued, and the Company cannot yet fully evaluate the impact of the legislation on overall tax expense or the valuation of the DTA. It is likely that the Company will lose benefits of various tax management strategies and, as a result, the total tax expense will increase.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, our primary federal regulator, the OCC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC, as insurer of the Bank\u2019s deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to effectively manage and mitigate risk while minimizing exposure to potential losses. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations.", "PERMNO": 92685, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MLVF"}
