{"cik": "72573", "company": "MOVADO GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating Movado Group\u2019s business. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Additional risks which the Company does not presently consider material, or of which it is not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on the business. Please also see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. or in other key markets, and the resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer confidence and spending, including, but not limited to, general economic and business conditions; wages and employment levels; volatility in the stock market; home values; inflation; consumer debt levels; availability and cost of consumer credit; economic uncertainty; solvency concerns of major financial institutions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; fuel and energy costs and/or shortages; tax issues; and general political conditions, both domestic and abroad.\nAdverse economic conditions, including declines in employment levels, disposable income, consumer confidence and economic growth could result in decreased consumer spending that would adversely affect sales of consumer goods, particularly those, such as the Company\u2019s products, that are viewed as discretionary items. In addition, events such as war, terrorism, natural disasters or outbreaks of disease could further suppress consumer spending on discretionary items. If any of these events should occur, the Company\u2019s future sales could decline.\nChanges to existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, whether in the United States or in any of the other key markets in which the Company does business, could require the Company to change any number of its business practices which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company conducts business, either directly or indirectly, in numerous countries and accordingly is subject to a multitude of legal requirements impacting every aspect of its operations. Changes to existing laws and regulations or new laws and regulations could impose new requirements and additional, associated costs on the Company and its suppliers, making the Company\u2019s products more costly to produce, forcing the Company to change its existing business practices and potentially affecting its financial condition and results of operations. The Swiss parliament recently amended its Federal Act on the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source to require that a greater percentage of manufacturing costs be incurred in Switzerland for goods to bear a Swiss indication of origin. The date of entry into force of this new, so-called \u201cSwissness\u201d act remains to be confirmed and its implementation with respect to watches requires the further approval of an ordinance by the Swiss Federal Counsel. A draft of such an ordinance has been proposed by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (\u201cFH\u201d). Under the FH draft ordinance (which calls for a five year transition period from the date the ordinance is approved), a watch may only be marked with a Swiss indication of origin if, in addition to meeting existing requirements, the design and prototyping of the watch occurred in, and that at least 60% percent of the manufacturing costs were incurred in, Switzerland. Compliance with the new Swissness law and regulations may require the Company to incur additional costs and seek different sources of supply, which may increase the production costs of Movado, Ebel and Concord watches. The Company may also be unable to secure adequate Swiss-based suppliers to meet all of its needs. If the production costs for these watches become more expensive or the watches can no longer be marked as \u201cSwiss\u201d, the Company may then be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to other watch brands and sales of its products may decline, adversely affecting its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces intense competition in the worldwide watch industry not only from competitors selling traditional watches but also from those selling smart watches and other smart wearables.\nThe watch industry is highly competitive and the Company competes globally with numerous manufacturers, importers, distributors and Internet-based retailers, some of which are larger than the Company and have greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than the Company. The Company\u2019s products compete on the basis of price, features, brand image, design, perceived desirability, reliability and perceived attractiveness. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s products will compete effectively in the future and, unless the Company remains competitive, its future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company also faces increased, new competition from companies introducing and selling smart wearable devices including smart watches. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than does the Company. The sale of these new smart products could materially adversely impact the traditional watch market and the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition unless the Company is able to effectively compete in this new product area. The Company\u2019s ability to successfully design, produce, market and sell products which are competitive with smart watches and other similar wearables will depend, among other things, on its ability to obtain the necessary expertise in this area by enhancing its internal capabilities or by entering into business relationships with third parties that have such expertise. Even if the Company is able to launch smart watches or other such products, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in a timely manner or frequently enough to remain competitive or that those products will be successful commercially. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in the Company\u2019s products not achieving market acceptance or becoming obsolete.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to the success of the Company, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nFavorable brand recognition is an important factor to the future success of the Company. The Company sells its products under a variety of owned and licensed brands. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside the Company\u2019s control, and the Company\u2019s efforts to create or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as making significant investments in marketing and advertising campaigns, product design and anticipation of fashion trends, may not have their desired effects. Additionally, the Company relies on its licensors to maintain favorable brand recognition of their respective brands, and the Company often has no control over the brand management efforts of its licensors. Finally, although the Company\u2019s independent distributors are subject to contractual requirements to protect the Company\u2019s brands, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions.\nAny decline in perceived favorable recognition of the Company\u2019s owned or licensed brands could materially and adversely affect future results of operations and profitability. If the Company is unable to respond to changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner, sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nFashion trends and consumer demands and tastes often shift quickly. The Company attempts to monitor these trends in order to adapt its product offerings to suit customer demand. There is a risk that the Company will not properly perceive changes in trends or tastes, which may result in the failure to adapt the Company\u2019s products accordingly. In addition, new model designs are regularly introduced into the market for all brands to keep ahead of evolving fashion trends as well as to initiate new trends of their own. There is risk that the public may not favor these new models or that the models may not be ready for sale until after the trend has passed. If the Company fails to respond to and keep up to date with fashion trends and consumer demands and tastes, its brand image, sales, profitability and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the Company misjudges the demand for its products, high inventory levels could adversely affect future operating results and profitability.\nConsumer demand for the Company\u2019s products can affect inventory levels. If consumer demand is lower than expected, inventory levels can rise causing a strain on operating cash flow. If the inventory cannot be sold through the Company\u2019s wholesale or retail outlets, additional write-downs or write-offs to future earnings could be necessary. Conversely, if consumer demand is higher than expected, insufficient inventory levels could result in unfilled customer orders, loss of revenue and an unfavorable impact on customer relationships. In particular, volatility and uncertainty related to macro-economic factors make it more difficult for the Company to forecast customer demand in its various markets. Failure to properly judge consumer demand and properly manage inventory could have a material adverse effect on profitability and liquidity.\nAn increase in product returns could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results and profitability.\nThe Company recognizes revenue as sales when merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer. The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products and accepts limited amounts of product returns in certain instances. Accordingly, the Company provides allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience. While such returns have historically been within management\u2019s expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. Any significant increase in damaged or defective products or expected returns could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize.\nThe Company\u2019s business relies on the use of independent parties to manufacture its products. Any loss of an independent manufacturer, or the Company\u2019s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on customer relations, brand image, net sales and results of operations.\nThe Company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand. Most of these manufacturers rely on third party suppliers for the various component parts needed to assemble finished watches sold to the Company. All such independent manufacturers and suppliers must achieve and maintain the Company\u2019s high quality standards and specifications. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet the Company\u2019s high quality standards and specifications could cause the Company to miss committed delivery dates with customers, which could result in cancellation of the customers\u2019 orders. In addition, delays in delivery of satisfactory products could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability, particularly if the delays cause the Company to be unable to market certain products during the seasonal periods when its sales are typically higher. See \u201cRisk Factors - The Company\u2019s business is seasonal, with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons, so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\u201d A majority of the Swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of Movado, Ebel, Concord and ESQ watches are purchased from two suppliers, one of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of one of the Company\u2019s competitors. Additionally, the Company generally does not have long-term supply commitments with its manufacturers and thus competes for production facilities with other organizations, some of which are larger and have greater resources. Any loss of an independent manufacturer or disruption in the supply chain with respect to critical component parts may result in the Company\u2019s inability to deliver quality goods in a timely manner and could have an adverse effect on customer relations, brand image, net sales and results of operations.\nThe Company contractually obligates its contract manufacturers to adhere to the Company\u2019s vendor code of conduct and similar codes of conduct adopted by the Company\u2019s trademark licensors and the Company monitors compliance with those codes by conducting periodic factory audits. There can be no assurance, however, that any of those independent manufacturers or one or more of the Company\u2019s licensors might not violate labor or other laws or use labor practices that deviate from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other countries in which the violation or other activities occurred. Such an event could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products or damage the Company\u2019s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss or shut down of any of the Company\u2019s major warehouse and distribution centers could materially adversely affect its business.\nThe Company operates one distribution facility in New Jersey that is responsible for importing and warehousing products as well as fulfilling and shipping orders to all of the Company\u2019s customers in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The Company operates a smaller, similar facility in Bienne, Switzerland for the distribution of its Swiss watch brands throughout Europe and the Middle East, and has contracted with a third party warehouse and fulfillment provider in Asia to handle most of the distribution of its licensed brands. The complete or partial loss or temporary shutdown of any of these facilities (including as a result of fire or other casualty or labor or other disturbances) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company\u2019s New Jersey warehouse and distribution facility is operated in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board and is highly regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which, under certain circumstances, has the right to shut down the entire sub-zone and, therefore, the entire warehouse and distribution facility. If that were to occur, the Company\u2019s ability to fill orders for its U.S., Canadian and Caribbean customers would be significantly impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company loses any of its license agreements, there may be significant loss of revenues and a negative effect on business.\nThe Company has the right to produce, market and distribute watches under the brand names of ESQ, Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, HUGO BOSS, Juicy Couture, Scuderia Ferrari and Lacoste pursuant to license agreements with the respective owners of those trademarks. There are certain minimum royalty payments as well as other requirements associated with these agreements. Failure to meet any of these requirements could result in the loss of the license. Additionally, after the term of any license agreement has concluded, the licensor may decide not to renew with the Company. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, the above mentioned licensed brands represented approximately 51% of the Company\u2019s net sales. While no individual licensed brand represented net sales greater than 20% of the Company\u2019s total consolidated net sales, the loss of any single licensed brand could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and although the Company is not substantially dependent on a particular license brand, the loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s licenses could result in loss of future revenues which could adversely affect its financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability under its various license agreements may change from period to period due to various factors, including the maturity of the Company's relationship with the respective licensor, changes in consumer preferences, brand repositioning activities and other factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control.\nChanges in the sales or channel mix of the Company\u2019s products could impact gross profit margins.\nThe individual brands that are sold by the Company are sold at a wide range of price points and yield a variety of gross profit margins. In addition, sales of excess and/or discontinued inventory into the liquidation channel generate a lower gross profit margin than non-liquidation sales. Thus, the mix of sales by brand as well as by distribution channel can have an impact on the gross profit margins of the Company. If the Company\u2019s sales mix shifts unfavorably toward brands with lower gross profit margins than the Company\u2019s historical consolidated gross profit margin or if a greater proportion of liquidation sales are made, it could have an adverse effect on the results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is seasonal, with sales traditionally greater during certain holiday seasons, so events and circumstances that adversely affect holiday consumer spending will have a disproportionately adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are seasonal by nature. The Company\u2019s U.S. sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Internationally, major selling seasons center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during these seasons depends upon the general level of retail sales at such times, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. The second half of each year accounted for 54.9%, 56.5%, and 56.1% of the Company\u2019s net sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. If events or circumstances were to occur that negatively impact consumer spending during such holiday seasons, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales, profitability and results of operations.\nSales in the Company\u2019s retail outlet stores are dependent upon customer foot traffic.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s retail outlet stores is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the amount of customer foot traffic generated by the outlet centers in which those stores are located.\nFactors that can affect customer foot traffic include:\n\u00b7\ndecline in customer discretionary spending;\n\u00b7\nthe location of the outlet center;\n\u00b7\nthe location of the Company\u2019s store within the outlet center;\n\u00b7\nthe other tenants in the outlet center;\n\u00b7\nthe occupancy rate of the outlet center;\n\u00b7\nthe success of the outlet center and tenant advertising to attract customers;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition in areas surrounding the outlet center; and\n\u00b7\nincreased competition from shopping over the internet and other alternatives such as mail-order.\nAdditionally, since most of the Company\u2019s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations, factors that affect travel could decrease outlet center traffic. Such factors include the price and supply of fuel, travel concerns and restrictions, international instability, terrorism and inclement weather. A reduction in foot traffic in relevant shopping centers could have a material adverse effect on retail sales and profitability.\nIf the Company is unable to maintain existing space or to lease new space for its retail stores in prime outlet center locations or is unable to complete construction on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s ability to achieve favorable results in its retail business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s outlet stores are strategically located in top outlet centers in the United States, most of which are located near vacation destinations. If the Company cannot maintain and secure locations in prime outlet centers for its outlet stores, it could jeopardize the operations of the stores and business plans for the future. Additionally, if the Company cannot complete construction in new stores within the planned timeframes, cost overruns and lost revenue could adversely affect the profitability of the retail segment. The Company on average plans for two to three new stores or renovations per fiscal year. The average time required to build-out or renovate each store and open it after delivery of possession is generally less than 60 days.\nCurrent or future cost reduction, streamlining, restructuring or business optimization initiatives could result in the Company incurring various one-time, non-recurring or unusual charges and other items, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported earnings per share and other unadjusted financial measures.\nIn the course of the Company\u2019s efforts to implement its business plan to adapt to the changing economic environment, the Company may be required to take actions that could result in the incurrence of various one-time, non-recurring or unusual charges and other items. These charges and other items may include severance and relocation expenses, write-offs or write-downs of assets, impairment charges, facilities closure costs or other business optimization costs. In general, these costs will reduce the Company\u2019s operating income and net income (along with the associated unadjusted per share measures). Therefore, such charges and other items could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations and the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully implement its growth strategies, its future operating results could suffer.\nThere are certain risks involved in the Company seeking to expand its business through acquisitions, license agreements, joint ventures and other initiatives. There is risk involved with each of these. Acquisitions and new license agreements require the Company to ensure that new brands will successfully complement the other brands in its portfolio. The Company assumes the risk that the new brand will not be viewed by the public as favorably as its other brands. In addition, the integration of an acquired company or licensed brand into the Company\u2019s existing business can strain the Company\u2019s current infrastructure with the additional work required and there can be no assurance that the integration of acquisitions or licensed brands will be successful or that acquisitions or licensed brands will generate sales increases. The Company needs to ensure it has the adequate human resources and systems in place to allow for successful assimilation of new businesses. The inability to successfully implement its growth strategies could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss or infringement of the Company\u2019s trademarks or other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on future results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its trademarks and other intellectual property rights are vital to the competitiveness and success of its business and therefore it takes all appropriate actions to register and protect them. Such actions may not be adequate to prevent imitation of the Company\u2019s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights, or to assure that others will not challenge the Company\u2019s rights, or that such rights will be successfully defended. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries, including some in which the Company sells its products, may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, which could make it more difficult to successfully defend such challenges to them. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain or maintain rights in its trademarks, including its licensed marks, could have an adverse effect on brand image and future results of operations.\nFluctuations in the pricing of commodities or the cost of labor could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce products at favorable prices.\nSome of the Company\u2019s higher-end watch offerings are made with materials such as diamonds, precious metals and gold. The Company relies on independent contractors to manufacture and assemble the majority of its watch brands. A significant change in the prices of these commodities or the cost of third-party labor could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by:\n\u00b7\nreducing gross profit margins;\n\u00b7\nforcing an increase in suggested retail prices; which could lead to\n\u00b7\ndecreasing consumer demand; which could lead to\n\u00b7\nhigher inventory levels.\nAny and all of the above events could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future cash flow and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s inventory purchases are denominated in Swiss francs. The Company reduces its exposure to the Swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program. Under the hedging program, the Company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. In the event these exposures do not offset, the Company has the ability under a hedging program to utilize forward exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options to mitigate foreign currency risk. If these hedge instruments are unsuccessful at minimizing the risk or are deemed ineffective, any fluctuation of the Swiss franc exchange rate could impact the future results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect relative prices at which the Company and its foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Additionally, a portion of the Company\u2019s net sales are recorded in its foreign subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency of that subsidiary. This predominantly occurs in the Company\u2019s Hong Kong and Swiss subsidiaries when they sell to Euro and British Pound based customers. As of January 31, 2015, this exposure was not hedged by the Company. Starting in fiscal 2016 the Company plans to utilize forward exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure. Any fluctuation in the Euro and British Pound exchange rates in relation to the Hong Kong dollar and Swiss franc would have an effect on these sales that are recorded in Euros and British Pounds. The currency effect on these sales has an equal effect on their recorded gross profit since the costs of these sales are recorded in the entities\u2019 respective local currency. As a result of these and other foreign currency sales, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries have outstanding foreign currency receivables. Furthermore, since the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries must be translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reported revenues, earnings, financial position and the comparability of results of operations from period to period.\nThe Grinberg family owns a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s stock.\nEach share of common stock of the Company is entitled to one vote per share while each share of class A common stock of the Company is entitled to ten votes per share. While the members of the Grinberg family do not own a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, by their significant holdings of class A common stock they control a majority of the voting power represented by all outstanding shares of both classes of stock. Consequently, the Grinberg family is in a position to significantly influence any matters that are brought to a vote of the shareholders including, but not limited to, the election of the Board of Directors and any action requiring the approval of shareholders, including any amendments to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. This concentration of ownership also may delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of the Company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the Grinberg family. These transactions might include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of shares of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline due to changes in revenue, operating results and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations and cash flow can be affected by several factors, some of which are not within its control. Those factors include, but are not limited to, those described as risk factors in this Item 1A and under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1.\nAny or all of these factors could cause a decline in revenues or increased expenses, both of which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations. If the Company\u2019s earnings failed to meet the expectations of the public in any given period, the Company\u2019s stock price could fluctuate and possibly decline.\nIf the Company were to lose its relationship with any of its key customers or distributors or any of such customers or distributors were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, there may be a significant loss of revenue and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s customer base covers a wide range of distribution including national jewelry store chains, department stores, independent regional jewelers, licensors\u2019 retail stores and a network of independent distributors in many countries throughout the world. Except for its agreements with independent distributors, the Company does not have long-term sales contracts with its customers, nor does it have a significant backlog of unfilled orders. Customer purchasing decisions could vary with each selling season. A material change in the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 purchasing decisions could have an adverse effect on its revenue and operating results.\nThe Company extends credit to its customers based on an evaluation of each customer\u2019s financial condition usually without requiring collateral. Should any of the Company\u2019s larger customers experience financial difficulties, it could result in the Company\u2019s curtailing of doing business with them, an increased rate of product returns or an increase in its exposure related to its accounts receivable. The inability to collect on these receivables could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nThe inability or difficulty of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and business partners to obtain credit, could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity.\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and business partners rely on a stable, liquid and well-functioning financial system to fund their operations and a disruption in their ability to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions to or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to the Company, including delivering product ordered by the Company and placing or paying for future orders of the Company\u2019s products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s wholesale business could be negatively affected by further changes of ownership, contraction and consolidation in the retail industry.\nA large portion of the Company\u2019s U.S. wholesale business is based on sales to major jewelry store chains and department stores. In recent years, the retail industry has experienced changes in ownership, contraction and consolidations, with a number of jewelry chain stores and department store operators going out of business and liquidating their inventory. Future reorganizations, changes of ownership and consolidations could further reduce the number of retail doors in which the Company\u2019s products are sold and increase the concentration of sales among fewer national or large regional retailers, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s wholesale business.\nIf the Company were to lose key members of management or be unable to attract and retain the talent required for the business, operating results could suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to execute key operating initiatives as well as to deliver product and marketing concepts appealing to target consumers depends largely on the efforts and abilities of key executives and senior management\u2019s competencies. The unexpected loss of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the future business. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the talent and skills needed in the future.\nIf the Company cannot secure financing and credit on favorable terms, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nCredit and equity markets remain sensitive to world events and macro-economic developments. Therefore, the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for the Company\u2019s operations or to refinance long-term obligations as they become payable. In addition, the Company\u2019s borrowing costs can be affected by independent rating agencies\u2019 short and long-term debt ratings which are based largely on the Company\u2019s performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely also increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for it to obtain financing. A significant increase in the costs that the Company incurs in order to finance its operations may have a material adverse impact on its business results and financial condition.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business.\nThe Company assembles all of its watches in Europe and Asia. The Company also generates approximately 45% of its revenue from international sources.\nFactors that could affect this business activity vary by region and market and generally include without limitation:\n\u00b7\ninstability or changes in social, political and/or economic conditions that could disrupt the trade activity in the countries where the Company\u2019s manufacturers, suppliers and customers are located;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports and exports;\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe adoption or expansion of trade sanctions;\n\u00b7\nrecessions in foreign economies; and\n\u00b7\na significant change in currency valuation in specific countries or markets.\nIf the Company was unable to protect the security of personal information about its customers or employees or prevent a privacy breach, it could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and suffer significant negative publicity which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAs part of the normal course of business the Company is involved in the receipt and storage of electronic information about customers and employees, as well as proprietary financial and non-financial data. Although the Company believes it has taken reasonable and appropriate actions to protect the security of this information, if the Company were to experience a security breach, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events, it could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation, attract a substantial amount of media attention, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation and its relationships with its customers and employees, materially adversely affecting the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on its information systems to run its business and any significant disruption to those systems could materially disrupt the Company\u2019s business and adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company relies on its information systems to operate every aspect of its world-wide business, including, without limitation, order processing, inventory and supply chain management, customer communications, purchasing and financial reporting. Although the Company attempts to take all reasonable steps to mitigate the risks to its information management systems, including such measures as the use of firewalls, automatically expiring passwords, encryption technology and periodic vulnerability tests, no system can be completely secure against all threats. It is possible that the Company\u2019s information systems will experience system failures, viruses, security breaches, power outages, network and telecommunications failures, usage errors by our employees, harmful acts by our website visitors or other events which could disable or significantly impair the systems\u2019 functionality. Additionally, the Company\u2019s systems may fail to operate properly or effectively, experience problems transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulties in integrating new systems. Any material disruption or slowdown of the Company\u2019s information systems could result in the loss of critical data, the inability to process and properly record transactions and could materially impair the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business, leading to cancelled orders and lost sales. In addition, the Company engages in e-commerce and is vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. A breach and loss of data could also subject the Company to liability to its customers or suppliers and could also cause competitive harm if sensitive information is publicized. In the event the Company is not successful in responding to these risks and uncertainties, its online sales may decline, the associated costs with its e-commerce activity may increase and the reputation of its brands may be damaged.", "PERMNO": 79611, "SIC": 3873, "TIC": "MOV"}
