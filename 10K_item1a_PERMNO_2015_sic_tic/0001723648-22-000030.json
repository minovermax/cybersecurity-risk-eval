RISK FACTORS\nThe occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have a material adverse effect on the business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of LiveVox. In reviewing these risk factors, you should also consider the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, which implicate, and may amplify, the risks and uncertainties facing LiveVox, and their potential impact on LiveVox\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. You should carefully review and consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, including matters addressed in the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d LiveVox may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also impair LiveVox\u2019s business or financial condition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following summary description sets forth an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities:\n\u2022If we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional products and functionality to our existing customers, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed.\n\u2022The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or on the operations of many of our customers and third-party suppliers, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\n\u2022Our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\n\u2022We have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u2022We depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled executives and other employees could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Failure to adequately retain our key employees, including those in our sales force, could impede our growth.\n\u2022The markets in which we participate involve numerous competitors and are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022If we fail to grow our marketing capabilities and develop widespread brand awareness cost effectively, our business may suffer.\n\u2022We may expand our international operations, which would expose us to significant risks.\n\u2022If we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing customers may experience service outages, our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our products, and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damages.\n\u2022Data security incidents and cybersecurity breaches could harm our reputation, cause us to modify business practices and otherwise adversely affect business, and subject us to liability.\n\u2022We rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our products, including connectivity to our cloud contact center software, and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause us to lose customers and subject us to claims for credits or damages, among other things.\n\u2022If our products fail, or are perceived to fail, to perform properly or if they contain technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline, and/or we could be subject to product liability claims.\n\u2022The contact center software market is subject to rapid technological change, and we must develop and sell incremental and new features and products in order to maintain and grow our business.\n\u2022Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\n\u2022We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\n\u2022We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022The terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Alleged or actual failure by us, our competitors, or other companies to comply with the constantly evolving legal and contractual environment surrounding calling or texting, and the governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Privacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce the demand for our solution, increase our costs and harm our business.\n\u2022Increased taxes and surcharges (including Universal Service Fund, whether labeled a \u201ctax,\u201d \u201csurcharge,\u201d or other designation) on our products may increase our customers\u2019 cost of using our products and/or increase our costs and reduce our profit margins to the extent the costs are not passed through to our customers, and we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and other taxes, surcharges and fees.\n\u2022Requirements for us or our suppliers to pay federal or state universal service fund contribution amounts and assessments (either we paying directly or paying through our suppliers in the form of surcharges) for other telecommunications funds or taxes could impact the desirability and profitability of our products.\n\u2022Changes in government regulation applicable to the collections industry or any failure of us or our customers to comply with existing regulations could result in the suspension, termination or impairment of the ability of us or our customers to conduct business, may require the payment of significant fines by us or our customers and could require changes in customer\u2019s businesses that would reduce the need for our products, or require other significant expenditures.\n\u2022We have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\n\u2022Our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n\u2022We may acquire other companies or technologies or be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nThe summary risk factors described above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below and in the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks summarized above or described in full below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or sell additional products and functionality to our existing customers, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed.\nTo increase our revenue, we must add new customers, increase the amount and types of business we do with existing customers, and encourage existing customers to renew their product subscriptions on terms favorable to us. As our industry matures, as our customers experience seasonal trends in their business, or as competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete favorably with us, our ability to add new customers and renew, maintain or sell additional products to existing customers based on pricing, cost of ownership, technology and functionality could be harmed. As a result, our existing customers may not renew their agreements or may decrease the amount of business they do with us, or may place increased pressure on us for pricing concessions, and we may be unable to attract new customers or grow or maintain our business with existing customers, each of which could harm our revenue and growth.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or on the operations of many of our customers and third-party suppliers, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 was reported and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has continued to significantly harm the U.S. and global economies and has caused significant fluctuation in financial markets and regulatory frameworks and may impact demand for our products.\nIn accordance with the various and changing regulatory frameworks and social distancing and other business or office closure orders and recommendations of applicable government agencies, all of our employees transitioned to work-from-home operations and we canceled all business travel by our employees except where necessary and properly authorized, which changed how we operate our business. Our customers and business partners are also subject to various and changing regulatory frameworks and social distancing and business or office closure orders and recommendations and travel restrictions or prohibitions, which have changed the way we interact with our customers and business partners. Recently, we have re-opened our U.S. and foreign offices for employees to voluntarily return, subject to capacity restrictions and applicable government regulations, including relating to COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and masking. We have also reinstated business travel on a voluntary basis and subject to prior approval. Our efforts to re-open our offices, comply with government regulations regarding COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and masking, and reinstate business travel safely may not be successful, could expose our employees and customers to health risks and us to associated liability, and will involve additional financial and administrative burdens.\nMoreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of which depends upon its prolonged impact, has or may:\n\u2022harm our ability to renew and maintain our relationships with our existing customers;\n\u2022cause our existing customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us, seek price concessions, declare bankruptcy or go out of business, which would harm our revenue;\n\u2022result in some of our customers failing to comply with the terms of their agreements, including payment terms, due to economic uncertainty, financial hardship, and even failure of these businesses, which could result in us being required to take action to collect payments, terminate their product subscriptions, increase accounts receivable, and reduce consumer collections, any of which could increase our expenses, reduce our cashflow, and harm our revenues and results of operations;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to sell additional products or functionality to our existing customers;\n\u2022reduce the rate of spending on enterprise software solutions or cloud-based enterprise contact center systems generally;\n\u2022delay prospective customers\u2019 decisions to subscribe to our products, increase the length of sales cycles, or slow the typical growth in the use of our products once customers have initially deployed our products;\n\u2022harm our ability to effectively market and sell our solutions, particularly as our customers remain subject to office closure orders;\n\u2022change the mix and sizes or types of organizations that purchase our products;\n\u2022delay the introduction of enhancements to our products and market acceptance of any new features and products;\n\u2022harm our ability to establish and/or grow our international sales and operations;\n\u2022harm our ability to recruit, onboard and successfully integrate new employees, including members of our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, as a result of not being able to interface in person;\n\u2022harm our ability to maintain our corporate culture with an employee base primarily working remotely and facing unique personal and professional challenges;\n\u2022increase the burden on our technical operations infrastructure, which could harm the capacity, stability, security and performance of our operations infrastructure and potentially leave us more vulnerable to security breaches;\n\u2022increase the risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks, exploitation of any cybersecurity flaws that may exist, an increase in the number cybersecurity threats or attacks, and other security challenges as a result of our employees and service providers continuing to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work and resource access expand;\n\u2022increase costs in returning to work as our offices continue to re-open, including changes to the workplace, such as space planning, food service, and amenities, and the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety policies and protocols;\n\u2022limit our ability to deliver products efficiently to our larger customers, as those products often require services that have sometimes been performed onsite, which could delay implementation of our products at new customers;\n\u2022harm our ability to manage, maintain or increase our network of master agents, referral agents and other third-party selling partners to sell our products, and make it more difficult for them to assist us effectively with their sales efforts;\n\u2022impact the health and safety of our employees, including our senior management team, and their ability to perform services;\n\u2022cause our management team to continue to commit significant time, attention and resources to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and seek to mitigate our effect on our business and workforce; and\n\u2022lead to the adoption of additional new laws and regulations that we and/or our customers and partners are required to comply with and that could harm our results of operations and may subject us to COVID-19 related regulations, fines, penalties, and litigation.\nSuch effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter. While several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, began to relax the early public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities, both globally and in the United States, have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases and hospitalizations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of the emergence of new variants. This increase in cases has led to the reintroduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions elsewhere. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may experience or continue to experience a recession, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nAny of the foregoing factors could significantly harm our future sales, operating results, cash flow, gross margin and overall financial performance, which could cause us to experience a decreased level of growth of our business and make our future financial results and prospects difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on LiveVox and the U.S. and global economies, could limit our ability to forecast our future operating results, including our ability to predict revenue and expense levels, and plan for and model future results of operations. Moreover, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from existing customers, downturns in new sales will not immediately be reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern until future periods. Our competitors could experience similar or different impacts as a result of COVID-19, which could result in changes to our competitive landscape.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the ongoing severity and transmission rate of the virus and the emergence of new virus variants, the extent and effectiveness of vaccine programs and other containment actions, the duration of social distancing, office closure and other restrictions on businesses and society at large, and the specific impact of these and other factors on our business, employees, customers and partners. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak on our business and operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. The effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and increase many of the other risks described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere herein.\nOur recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were $119.2 million, $102.5 million and $92.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 16.3% and 10.5%. In the future, as our revenue increases, our annual revenue growth rate may decline. We believe our revenue growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022compete with other vendors of cloud-based enterprise contact center systems, including recent market entrants, and with providers of legacy on-premise systems;\n\u2022increase our existing customers\u2019 use of our products and further develop our partner ecosystem;\n\u2022strengthen and improve our products through significant investments in research and development and the introduction of new and enhanced products;\n\u2022introduce our products to new markets outside of the United States and increase global awareness of our brand;\n\u2022selectively pursue acquisitions that enhance our product offerings; and\n\u2022respond to general macro-economic factors and industry and market conditions.\nIf we are not successful in achieving these objectives, our ability to grow our revenue may be harmed. In addition, we have recently invested in, and may continue to invest in future growth, including expending substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022expanding our sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022our technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, management tools, scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u2022our product development, including investments in related personnel and the development of new products, as well as new applications and features for existing products;\n\u2022international expansion; and\n\u2022general administration, including legal, regulatory compliance and accounting expenses.\nMoreover, we have recently expanded our headcount and operations. We grew from 461 employees as of December 31, 2019 to 506 employees as of December 31, 2020, and to 672 employees as of December 31, 2021. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in future years. This growth has placed, and any future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial resources, company culture and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively while retaining personnel. To manage future growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, system failures, difficulties in introducing new features or products, the need for more capital than we anticipate or other operational difficulties, any of which could harm our business performance and results of operations.\nThe addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to help us grow and to manage that growth may make it more difficult to generate earnings or offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing costs and expenses in the short term. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully, which could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur recent growth makes it difficult to evaluate and predict our current business and future prospects.\nWhile we have been in existence for over twenty years, much of our growth has occurred in recent years. Our recent growth may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing and unforeseen expenses as we may grow our business and the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report.\nOur ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to predict revenue and expense levels and plan for and model future growth. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties,\nwhich we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to adjustments in our markets or our competitors and their product offerings, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe incurred a net loss of $103.2 million, $4.6 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $128.0 million. These losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made, and continue to make, to develop our products and acquire new customers, among other expenses. The increase to net loss was primarily attributable to the compensation expense of $68.4 million associated with our Value Creation Incentive Plan (\u201cVCIP\u201d) and Option-based Incentive Plan (\u201cOBIP\u201d) awards that fully vested upon a liquidity event (i.e. the Merger) in the second quarter of 2021. We expect the dollar amount of our costs and expenses to increase in the future as revenue increases, although at a slower rate. We expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and expand our business and as we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with being a public company. Our historical or recent growth in revenue is not necessarily indicative of our future performance. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled executives and other employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the performance and continued services of our executive officers and senior management team. If our executive leadership team fails to perform effectively or if we fail to attract or retain our key executives or senior management, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could seriously harm our business. We currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel and we may incur significant costs (including stock-based compensation expense) to do so. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior executives, engineers highly experienced in designing and developing cloud software and for senior sales personnel. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases our costs. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, particularly our executive officers and senior management team, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. We may experience increased attrition of employees to other opportunities, particularly as we reopen our offices, as certain employees may seek more flexible work alternatives than we offer, or may seek positions with companies outside of the geographic area in which they live that offer remote work opportunities.\nContinued volatility or lack of performance in the trading price of our common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because job candidates and existing employees often emphasize the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment when considering whether to accept or continue employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards is low or declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.\nFailure to adequately retain our key employees, including those in our sales force, could impede our growth.\nKey to our success is the continuity and development of key employees, including those in our sales force. We need to continue to retain key employees, including members of our sales force while expanding and optimizing our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and sale of our products requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take several months before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if we fail to retain key employees, including members of our sales force, or if our investments, and the expense incurred, to expand and train our sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenue, which could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and our failure to successfully maintain, grow and manage these relationships could harm our business.\nWe leverage strategic relationships with third-party technology providers, including telecommunications providers. These relationships are typically not exclusive and our partners often also offer products to and enter into partnerships with our competitors. As we grow our business, we will continue to depend on both existing and new strategic relationships. Our competitors may be more successful than we are in establishing or expanding relationships with such third-party technology providers. Furthermore, there has and continues to be a significant amount of consolidation in the technology industry, including telecommunications providers, and if our partners are acquired, fail to work effectively with us or go out of business, they may no longer support our products, or may be less effective in doing so, which could harm our business, financial condition and operations. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer.\nIn addition, identifying new third-party technology providers, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. As the complexity of our products and our third-party relationships increases, the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities will become more complicated. We also license technology from certain third parties. Certain of these agreements permit either party to terminate all or a portion of the relationship without cause at any time and for any reason. If one of these agreements is terminated by the other party, we would have to find an alternative source or develop new technology ourselves, which could preclude, limit or delay our ability to offer our products or certain product features to our customers and could result in increased expense and harm our business. Our inability to manage and maintain these complex relationships successfully or negotiate sufficient and favorable contractual terms could harm our business.\nWe have established, and continue to increase, a network of master agents, referral agents and other third-party selling partners to sell our products. Our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain this network could materially harm our revenue.\nWe have established, and continue to increase, our network of master sales agents, referral agents and other third-party selling partners who provide sales leads to us for new customers. These selling partners sell, or may in the future decide to sell, products and/or solutions for our competitors. Our competitors may be able to cause our current or potential selling partners to favor their products over our products, either through financial incentives, technological innovation, product features or performance, or by offering a broader array of services to these selling partners or otherwise, which could reduce the effectiveness of our use of these selling partners. If we fail to maintain relationships with our current selling partners, fail to develop relationships with new selling partners, fail to manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing selling partners, or if our selling partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease or not grow at an appropriate rate and our operating results could be harmed. Additionally, in order to utilize our selling partners effectively, we must enhance our systems, develop specialized marketing materials and invest in educating selling partners regarding our systems and product offerings. Our failure to accomplish these objectives could limit our success in marketing and selling our products.\nIn addition, identifying new selling partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them requires significant time and resources. As the complexity of our products and our selling partner relationships increases, the management of those relationships and the negotiation of contractual terms sufficient to protect our rights and limit our potential liabilities will become more complex, and our inability to successfully manage these relationships or negotiate favorable contractual terms could harm our business.\nThe markets in which we participate involve numerous competitors and are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for contact center solutions is highly competitive. We currently compete with large legacy technology vendors that offer on-premise contact center systems, such as Avaya and Cisco, and legacy on-premise software companies, such as Aspect Software and Genesys (including through its acquisition of Interactive Intelligence). These legacy technology and software companies are increasingly supplementing their traditional on-premise contact center systems with competing cloud offerings, through a combination of acquisitions, partnerships and in-house development. Additionally, we compete with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software such as NICE inContact. We also face competition from many other contact center service providers including Five9, Talkdesk and Seranova, as well as vendors offering unified communications and contact center solutions. In addition, Amazon and Twilio have introduced solutions aimed at companies who wish to build their own contact centers with in-house developers. Furthermore, CRM vendors are increasingly offering features and functionality that were traditionally provided by contact center providers. CRM vendors also continue to partner with contact center service providers to provide integrated solutions and may, in the future, acquire competitive contact center service providers. These factors could harm our revenue and results of operations.\nOur actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial or technical resources. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our recent, and any future, acquisitions will subject us to new competitors and cause us to face additional and different competition in the markets served by these businesses.\nSome of our competitors can devote significantly greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services and many have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. Current or potential competitors may also be acquired by third parties with significantly greater resources. In addition, many of our competitors have more established relationships with customers, more comprehensive product offerings, larger installed bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and other third-party selling partners. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources and ability to compete. If our competitors\u2019 products, services or technologies become more accepted than our products, if they are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than us, or if their products or services are less expensive or more technologically capable than ours, our revenue could be harmed. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales and revenue, reduced margins and loss of, or a failure to maintain or improve, our competitive market position, any of which could harm our business.\nIf our existing customers terminate their product subscriptions or reduce their product subscriptions and related usage, our revenue and gross margin will be harmed and we will be required to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from existing customers. As a result, retaining our existing customers is critical to our future operating results. With limited exceptions, we offer annual and multiple-year contracts to our customers. Additional products can be provisioned on limited notice. Product subscriptions and related usage by our existing customers may decrease if:\n\u2022customers are not satisfied with our products, prices or the functionality of our products;\n\u2022the stability, performance or security of our products are not satisfactory;\n\u2022the U.S. or global economy declines;\n\u2022the ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on demand for our products and technology spending;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 business declines due to the loss of customers, industry cycles, seasonality, business difficulties or other reasons;\n\u2022our customers favor products offered by other contact center providers, particularly as competition continues to increase;\n\u2022alternative technologies, products or features emerge or gain popularity that we do not provide; or\n\u2022our customers or potential customers experience financial difficulties.\nIf our existing customers\u2019 product subscriptions and related usage decrease or are terminated, we will need to spend more money to acquire new customers and still may not be able to maintain our existing level of revenue. We incur significant costs and expenses, including sales and marketing expenses, to acquire new customers, and those costs and expenses are an important factor in determining our profitability. There can be no assurance that our efforts to acquire new customers will be successful.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers, or a failure by us to renew our product subscription agreements with one or more of our key customers, could harm our revenue and financial position, and our ability to market our products.\nWe rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to market and sell our products. The loss of any of our key customers, or a failure of some of them to renew or to continue to recommend our products, could have a significant impact on our revenue, reputation and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers, thereby reducing the number of our existing and potential customers and key reference customers.\nOur customers may fail to comply with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to collect payment, or may terminate their subscriptions for our products.\nIf customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or fail to comply with the terms of our agreements, including compliance with regulatory requirements and intellectual property terms, we may terminate customers, lose revenue, be unable to collect amounts due to us, be subject to legal or regulatory action and incur costs in enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, seek reimbursement for amounts already paid, or pay those amounts more slowly, which could harm our operating results, financial position and cash flow.\nMany of our customer contracts contain usage-based revenue components that depend upon such customer\u2019s ability to sustain or increase their business activity and such business activity can be subject to the impact of external events beyond our control or the control of such customers, including unexpected weather conditions, political instability or government shutdowns, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines) or natural disasters. Our revenue and profitability could be harmed as a result of any decrease to such customer\u2019s business activity.\nMany of our customer contracts contain usage-based revenue components that depend upon such customers\u2019 ability to sustain or increase their business activity. Such customers\u2019 business activity has in the past been and could in the future be subject to the impact of external events beyond our control or the control of such customers, such as unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines), political instability or government shutdowns or natural disasters. Additionally, certain of our customers typically increase their collection activities from January through April when many Americans receive federal tax refunds. Any delay in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to timely process Americans\u2019 federal tax returns and remit refunds to filers, including as a result of COVID-19 precautions or a government shutdown such as the one that occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, has in the past caused and could in the future cause those customers to forgo increases in hiring or usage which could in turn unfavorably impact our revenue and profitability.\nWe sell our products to larger enterprises that can require longer sales cycles, longer and more costly implementation periods, and more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay the time until revenue is recognized from these customers or prevent these sales from ever occurring, all of which could harm our revenue growth rates and profitability.\nAs we continue to target our sales efforts at larger enterprises, we face higher costs, longer sales cycles and longer and more costly implementation periods and less predictability in closing sales. These larger enterprises typically require more configuration and integration services which increases our upfront investment in sales and deployment efforts with no guarantee that these customers will subscribe to additional LiveVox products or subscribe to our products at all. Furthermore, with larger enterprises, we must provide a higher level of education regarding the use and benefits of our products to a broader group of people in order to generate a sale. As a result of these factors, we must devote a significant amount of sales support and professional services resources to individual customers and prospective customers, thereby increasing the cost and time required to complete sales. Our typical sales cycle for larger enterprises is six to twelve months, but can be significantly longer, and our average sales cycle may increase as sales to larger enterprises continue to grow in proportion to our overall new sales. In addition, many of our customers that are larger enterprises initially deploy our products to support only a portion of their contact center agents. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to increase the number of agent seats and the number of products utilized by these larger enterprises over time and we incur additional sales and marketing expenses in these efforts. There is no guarantee that these customers will purchase additional products from us or increase the number of agent seats for which they subscribe. If we do not expand our initial relationships with larger enterprises, the return on our investments in sales, marketing and implementation for these customers will decrease and our business may suffer.\nBecause a significant percentage of our revenue is recurring from existing customers, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers monthly as services are delivered. As a result, the vast majority of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from existing customers. Consequently, a decline in new product subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, the cumulative impact of such declines could negatively impact our business and results of operations in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products, and potential changes in our pricing policies or renewal rates, will typically not be reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We also may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, resulting in lower margins and earnings. In addition, our subscription model makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over time as services are delivered. Moreover, many of our customers initially deploy our products to support only a portion of their contact center agents and, therefore, we may not generate significant revenue from these new customers at the outset of their relationship, if at all. Any increase to our revenue and the value of these existing customer relationships will only be reflected in our results of operations as revenue is recognized, and if and when these customers increase the number of agent seats and the number of components of our products they deploy over time.\nShifts over time or from quarter-to-quarter in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our products or changes in the components of our products purchased by our customers could affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur strategy is to sell our products to both smaller and larger organizations. Our gross margins can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our products, including the features and number of agent seats purchased by our\ncustomers and the level of usage required by our customers. Sales to larger organizations may also entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts and expense. Selling to smaller customers may involve smaller contract sizes, fewer opportunities to sell additional services, a higher likelihood of contract terminations, lower returns on sales and marketing expense, fewer potential agent seats and greater credit risk and uncertainty. If the mix of organizations that purchase our products, or the mix of product components purchased by our customers, changes unfavorably, our revenues and gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be harmed.\nIf we fail to grow our marketing capabilities and develop widespread brand awareness cost effectively, our business may suffer.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our cloud contact center software products will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing operations. We plan to continue to dedicate significant resources to our marketing programs, including internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social media, trade shows, industry events, and co-marketing with strategic partners. The effectiveness of our internet advertising is as yet unproven, and there is existing competition for key search terms. All of these marketing efforts will continue to require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts and expenditures do not generate a proportionate increase in revenue.\nIn addition, we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenues, and even if they do, any increase in revenues may occur after the expense has been incurred and may not offset the costs and expenses of building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, or incur substantial costs and expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical to increasing customer adoption of our products.\nWe may expand our international operations, which would expose us to significant risks.\nTo date, we have not generated significant revenues outside of the U.S. However, we may seek to grow our international presence in the future. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to expand our operations and customer base to other countries. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the U.S. In addition, in order to effectively market and sell our products in international markets, we could be required to localize our products, including the language in which our products are offered, which will increase our costs, could result in delays in offering our products in these markets and may decrease the effectiveness of our sales efforts. Due to our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales and distribution channels in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful.\nSales to customers outside the United States or with international operations and our international sales efforts and operations support expose us to risks inherent in international sales and operations.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to expand our international sales efforts and develop a worldwide customer base. Because of our limited experience with international sales, our international expansion may not be successful and may not produce the return on investment we expect. To date, we have realized only a small portion of our revenues from customers outside the United States, with approximately 6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 derived from customers with a billing address outside of the United States.\nOur international subsidiaries employ workers primarily in India and Colombia. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to legal, labor and employment, intellectual property, regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. As we increase our international sales efforts we will face risks in doing business internationally that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022the need to establish and protect our brand in international markets;\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt our products for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated costs and expenses;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly hiring and training qualified sales and service personnel;\n\u2022the need to implement and offer customer care in various languages;\n\u2022different pricing environments, longer sales and accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the U.S. and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022privacy and data protection laws and regulations that are complex, expensive to comply with and may require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022increased risk of piracy, counterfeiting and other misappropriation of our intellectual property in our locations outside the U.S.;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022general economic conditions in international markets;\n\u2022fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which may make our products more expensive in other countries or may increase our costs, impacting our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including corporate, employment, tax, telecommunications and telemarketing laws and regulations;\n\u2022increased risk of international telecom fraud;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations applicable to foreign operations and cross border transactions, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, supply chain restrictions, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022restrictions or taxes on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022unstable economic and political conditions and potential accompanying shifts in laws and regulations.\nThese risks could harm our international operations, increase our operating costs and hinder our ability to grow our international business and, consequently, our overall business and results of operations.\nIn addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business outside the United States. We may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time, which often occurs with minimal or no advance notice. Failure to comply with these regulations could harm our business. In many countries outside the United States, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States or international regulations applicable to it. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, strategic partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, strategic partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, delays in filing financial reports required as a public company, penalties, or prohibitions on selling our products, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss, and under the existing federal corporate tax rates such tax benefits will be of less value, which could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had available federal and combined state net operating loss carryforwards which may offset future taxable income of $23.5 million and $95.5 million, respectively. The federal net operating losses expire between 2026 and 2035 while the state net operating losses expire between 2025 and 2041. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, they could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could harm our profitability and financial condition in future periods.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC Sections 382 and 383, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d An IRC Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Subsequent or future issuances or sales of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change,\u201d which would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused or to be reduced, and increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes. It is possible that such an ownership change could materially reduce our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset taxable income, which could require us to pay more income taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and harm our profitability.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\nIf we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing customers may experience service outages, our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our products, and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damages.\nOur success depends in large part upon the capacity, stability, security and performance of our operations infrastructure. From time to time, we have experienced interruptions in service, and we may experience such interruptions in the future. These service interruptions may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or\ncauses of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security, particularly as we increase the number of users of our products and the product applications that run on our system, could harm our relationships with our customers, result in claims for credits or damages, damage our reputation, significantly reduce customer demand for our products, cause us to incur significant expense and personnel time replacing and upgrading our infrastructure, and harm our business.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of agent seats and interactions that our infrastructure supports. As the number of agent seats within our customer base grows and our customers\u2019 use of our products increases, we need to continue to make additional investments in our capacity to maintain adequate and reliable stability and performance, the availability of which may be limited or the cost of which may be prohibitive, and any failure may cause interruptions in service that may harm our business. In addition, we need to manage our operations infrastructure properly in order to support version control, changes in hardware and software parameters and the evolution of our suite of products. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure requirements or efficiently improve our infrastructure, our business could be harmed.\nData security incidents could harm our reputation, cause us to modify business practices and otherwise adversely affect business, and subject us to liability.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate. In the ordinary course of business, we will collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of information, including, for example, information about our customers, our customers\u2019 clients or other information treated by our customers as confidential. We will need to be able to do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. Our obligations under applicable laws, regulations, contracts, industry standards, self-certifications, and other documentation may include maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal information in our possession or control and maintaining reasonable and appropriate security safeguards as part of an information security program. These obligations create potential legal liability to regulators, business partners, customers, and other relevant stakeholders and also affect the attractiveness of our products to existing and potential customers.\nAll information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including industrial espionage, organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others.\nAlthough we have, and may in the future, implement remote working protocols and offer work-issued devices to certain employees, the actions of employees while working remotely may have a greater effect on the security of our systems and the personal data we process, including for example by increasing the risk of compromise to systems or data arising from employees\u2019 combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do not control, or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network. Although many of these risks are not unique to the remote working environment, they have been heightened by the dramatic increase in the numbers of our employees who have been and are continuing to work from home as a result of government requirements or guidelines and internal policies that have been put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the threat of unauthorized access or acquisition of sensitive or personal information, other threats could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Our systems likely experience directed attacks on at least a periodic basis that are intended to interrupt our operations; interrupt our customers\u2019 ability to access our platform; extract money from us; and/or obtain our data (including without limitation user or employee personal information or proprietary information). Although we have implemented certain security measures, systems, processes, and safeguards intended to protect our information technology systems and data from such threats and mitigate risks to our systems and data, we cannot be certain that threat actors will not have a material impact on our systems or products in the future. Our safeguards intended to prevent or mitigate certain threats may not be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and data due to the developing sophistication and means of attack in the threat landscape. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. Recent developments in the threat landscape include an increased number of cyber extortion and ransomware attacks, with increases in the amount of ransom demands and the sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology.\nSignificant disruptions of third-party vendors\u2019 and/or commercial partners\u2019 information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive or personal information, which could harm our business. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our product development and business operations.\nThere is no way of knowing for certain whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe that we have experienced a data security incident that we have not discovered, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal their unauthorized access to systems, and many companies are not aware when they have been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of sensitive or personal information, including, but not limited to, personal information regarding our customers or our customers\u2019 customers, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. Such incidents could also cause interruptions to the products we provide, degrade the user experience, or cause customers to lose confidence in our products.\nApplicable data privacy and security laws may also obligate us to employ security measures that are appropriate to the nature of the data we collect and process and, among other factors, the risks attendant to data processing activities in order to protect personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration. We have implemented security measures that we believe are appropriate, but a regulator could deem the security measures not to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen safeguards will protect against security threats to our business including the personal data that we process. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our information technology systems and the data contained in those systems, or our data that is contained in third parties\u2019 systems. Moreover, certain data protection laws impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. Our employees\u2019 or third parties\u2019 intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for successful access, acquisition or other disclosure of our data despite the quality and legal sufficiency of our security measures.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with privacy, confidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any security incidents or other events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personal information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others. These could also cause third parties, including current and potential customers or partners, to lose trust in us, including for example perceiving our platform, system or networks as unreliable or less desirable. We could also be subject to claims by third parties that we have breached privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our products, including connectivity to our cloud contact center software, and any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause us to lose customers and subject us to claims for credits or damages, among other things.\nWe rely on services from third-party telecommunications providers in order to provide services to our customers and their customers, including telephone numbers. In addition, we depend on our internet bandwidth suppliers to provide uninterrupted and error-free service through their networks. We exercise little control over these third-party providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nWhen problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Service disruption or outages, whether caused by our service, the products or services of our third-party service providers, or our customers\u2019 or their customers\u2019 equipment and systems, may result in loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary repairs or other remedial actions may force us to incur significant costs and expenses.\nIf any of these service providers fail to provide reliable services, suffer outages, degrade, disrupt, increase the cost of or terminate the services that we and our customers depend on, we may be required to switch to another service provider. Delays caused by switching our technology to another service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could materially harm our customer relationships, business, financial condition and operating results. Further, any failure on the part of third-party service providers to achieve or maintain expected performance levels, stability and security could harm our relationships with our customers, cause us to lose customers, result in claims for credits or damages, increase our costs or the costs incurred by our customers, damage our reputation, significantly reduce customer demand for our products and seriously harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur customers rely on internet service providers to provide them with access and connectivity to our cloud contact center software, and changes in how internet service providers handle and charge for access to the internet could materially harm our customer relationships, business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur customers must have access to broadband internet access services in order to use our products and certain of our offerings require substantial capacity to operate effectively. In the United States, internet access services are provided by relatively few companies that, depending on the geographic area, have market power over such offerings. It is possible that these companies could charge us, our customers, or both, fees to guarantee a service amount of capacity, or for quality of broadband internet access services, or advantage themselves or our competitors by degrading, disrupting, limiting, or otherwise restricting the use of their infrastructure to support our services. Notably, some of the largest providers of broadband internet access services have committed to not engage in acts that would impede our customers\u2019 broadband internet access services from accessing products or services like ours but, depending on the facts, there may be no law that prohibits such providers from doing so. However, these providers likely have the ability to increase our rates, our customers\u2019 rates, or both for broadband internet access services which may increase the cost of our products making our products less competitive or decreasing our profit margins.\nIn 2018, the Federal Communications Commission or FCC released an order repealing rules that would have prevented broadband internet access providers from degrading, disrupting or otherwise restricting ours and our customers\u2019 broadband internet access services. The FCC\u2019s 2018 repeal was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in a decision issued in October 2019. That same court rejected the FCC\u2019s attempt to categorically preempt states from adopting their own network neutrality requirements, requiring case by case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC\u2019s rules. The court also required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order where it found insufficient analysis but allowed the order to remain in effect pending the FCC\u2019s review. The original parties were denied a rehearing by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in February 2020 and the period to seek review by the Supreme Court has ended. On remand, the FCC reaffirmed its existing approach in October 2020; however, four petitioners sought reconsideration of the FCC\u2019s decision in February 2021, and the FCC subsequently filed a motion requesting that the D.C. Circuit hold the case in abeyance, which the court granted. To the extent the courts, the agencies or the states do not uphold or adopt sufficient safeguards to protect against discriminatory conduct, network operators may seek to engage in blocking, throttling or other discriminatory practices against us or our customers, and our business could be harmed .\nAs we consider approaches for expanding internationally, government regulation protecting the non- discriminatory provision of internet access may be nascent or non-existent. In those markets where regulatory safeguards against unreasonable discrimination are nascent or non-existent and where local network operators possess substantial market power, we could experience anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise harm our business. Future regulations or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and result in additional liabilities for us, which may harm our business.\nWe depend on data centers operated by third parties and public cloud providers and any disruption in the operation of these facilities could harm our business.\nWe host our products at data centers owned and operated by third party providers and located in Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Canada, and Germany. Any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our customers. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, closes, suffers financial difficulty or is unable to meet our growing capacity needs, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and service interruptions in connection with doing so.\nThe data centers within which we host our products are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. These data centers are subject to disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, sabotage, break-ins, acts of vandalism and other events, which could cause service interruptions or the operators of these data centers to close their facilities for an extended period of time or permanently. The destruction or impairment of any of these data center facilities could result in significant downtime for our products and the loss of customer data. Because our ability to attract and retain customers depends on us providing customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our business, revenues and reputation. Additionally, in connection with the continuing expansion of our existing data center facilities, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server addition, relocation or other issues.\nThese data centers are also subject to increased power costs. We may not be able to pass on any increase in power costs to our customers, which could reduce our operating margins.\nWe have little or no control over public cloud providers. Any disruption of the public cloud or any failure of the public cloud providers to effectively design and implement sufficient security systems or plan for increases in capacity could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our products. In addition, using the public cloud presents a variety of additional risks, including risks related to sharing the same computing resources with others, reliance on public cloud providers\u2019 authentication, security, authorization and access control mechanisms, a lack of control over the public cloud\u2019s redundancy and security systems and fault tolerances, and a reduced ability to control data security and privacy.\nOur plans to establish public cloud-based data centers for our international operations may be unsuccessful and may present execution and competitive risks.\nWe may seek to establish new public cloud deployments in the future to facilitate our platform in certain international markets. We may partner with a third-party to develop, test and deploy our technology to offer a full stack of products on the public cloud in certain international markets. If we are successful in the deployment of our technology to the public cloud, we may expand our public cloud deployments to facilitate our platform in the U.S. and in international markets. Our public cloud-based platform offering is critical to developing and providing our products to our customers, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business. Infrastructure buildouts on the public cloud are complex, time-consuming and may involve substantial expenditures. In addition, the implementation of public cloud-based data centers involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. Even once we implement public cloud-based data centers, we may discover deficiencies in the design, implementation or maintenance of the system that could materially harm our business.\nDevelopment of our AI products to make agents more efficient and improve customer experience may not be successful and may result in reputational harm and our future operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe plan to increase and provide our customers with AI-powered applications, including conversational virtual agents, agent assistance and business insights. While we aim for our AI-powered applications to make agents more efficient and improve customer experience, our AI models may not achieve sufficient levels of accuracy. In addition, we may not be able to acquire sufficient training data or our training data may contain biased information. Furthermore, the costs of AI technologies, such as speech recognition and natural language processing, may be too high for market adoption. Our competitors or other organizations may incorporate AI features into their products more quickly or effectively and their AI features may achieve higher market acceptance than ours, which may result in us failing to recoup our investments in developing AI-powered applications. Should any of these items or others occur, our ability to compete, our reputation and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our products fail, or are perceived to fail, to perform properly or if they contain technical defects, our reputation could be harmed, our market share may decline, and/or we could be subject to product liability claims.\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects that may result in failures or otherwise cause our products to fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations and contractual obligations. Moreover, our customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our products, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm the perceived utility of our products and our brand. Because our customers use our products for mission-critical aspects of their business, any real or perceived errors or defects in, or other performance problems with, our products may damage our customers\u2019 businesses and could significantly harm our reputation. If that occurs, we could lose future sales, or our existing customers could cancel their use of our products, seek payment credits, seek damages against us, or delay or withhold payment to it, which could result in reduced revenues, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts and service credits, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, and harm our financial results. Customers also may make indemnification or warranty claims against us, which could result in significant expense and risk of litigation. Performance problems could result in loss of market share, reputational harm, failure to achieve market acceptance and the diversion of development resources.\nAny product liability, intellectual property, warranty or other claims against us could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant settlements or damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims. Also, our insurers may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. Any contract or product liability claims successfully brought against us would harm our business.\nThe contact center software market is subject to rapid technological change, and we must develop and sell incremental and new features and products in order to maintain and grow our business.\nThe contact center software market is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and features and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully, we must continue to devote significant resources to design, develop, deploy and sell new and enhanced contact center products, applications and features that provide increasingly higher capabilities, performance and stability at lower cost. If we are unable to develop or acquire new features for our existing products or new applications that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments, our business would be harmed. For example, we are focused on enhancing the reliability, features and functionality of our contact center products to enhance our utility to our customers, particularly larger customers, with complex, dynamic and global\noperations. The success of these enhancements depends on many factors, including timely development, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to transition our existing customers to these new products, applications and features. Failure in this regard may significantly impede our revenue growth. In addition, because our products are designed to operate on a variety of systems, we need to continuously modify and enhance our solution to keep pace with changes in hardware, operating systems, the increasing trend toward multichannel communications and other changes to software technologies. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring these modifications and enhancements or bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could delay introduction of changes and updates to our products and increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our products to operate effectively, including with future network platforms and technologies, could reduce the demand for our products, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.\nOur ability to continue to enhance our products is dependent on adequate research and development resources. If we are not able to adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must devote significant and increasing resources to developing new product offerings, features, and enhancements to our existing cloud contact center software, which will increase our research and development and operating expenses. Our research and development expenses totaled $52.6 million, $20.2 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to the VCIP and OBIP awards that fully vested upon a liquidity event (i.e. the Merger) and was recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the second quarter of 2021. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop products, applications or features internally due to constraints, such as high employee turnover, insufficient cash, inability to hire sufficient research and development personnel or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expend considerably greater amounts on their research and development programs than we do, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure to devote adequate research and development resources or compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain the compatibility of our software with other products and technologies, our business would be harmed.\nOur customers often integrate our products with their business applications. These third-party providers or their partners could alter their products so that our products no longer integrate well with them, or they could delay or deny our access to technology releases that allow us to adapt our products to integrate with their products in a timely fashion. If we cannot adapt our products to changes in complementary technology deployed by our customers, it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively.\nOur business could be harmed if our customers are not satisfied with the professional services or technical support provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, not only with respect to our products, but also with the professional services and technical support that are required for our customers to implement and use our products to address their business needs. Professional services and technical support may be performed by our own staff or, in a select subset of cases, by third parties. Some of our professional services offerings have negative margins. Accordingly, any increase in sales of professional services could harm our gross margins and operating results. We will need to continue to expand and optimize our professional services and technical support in order to keep up with new customer installations and ongoing service, which takes time and expense to implement. Identifying and recruiting qualified service personnel and training them in our products is difficult and competitive and requires significant time, expense and attention. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services or change our pricing to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase our costs and harm our operating results. If a customer is not satisfied with the deployment and ongoing services performed by us or a third party, we could lose customers, miss opportunities to expand our business with these customers, incur additional costs, or suffer reduced (including negative) margins on our service revenue, any of which could damage our ability to grow our business. In addition, negative publicity related to our professional services and technical support, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our products, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could harm our business.\nOur products incorporate certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such software from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to transition to other providers. In addition, integration of the software used in our products with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. To the extent that our products depend upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions, result in increased costs, or a failure of our products and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties and to integrate such software into our products.\nThere can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future, including to replace current third-party software, will be available to us at a reasonable cost or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Third-party licensors may also be acquired or go out of business, which could preclude us from continuing to use such technology. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in lost product features and litigation. The loss of existing licenses could also result in implementation delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could increase our costs and harm our business.\nOur products utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nOur products include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, for example, free general public use licenses, open source frontend libraries and open source applications. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our products. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and products. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Given the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. Many of the risks associated with the usage of open source software cannot be eliminated and could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2021, our intellectual property portfolio included four registered U.S. trademarks, two pending trademark applications, and one issued U.S. patent. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We may not be able to obtain any further patents or trademarks, our current patents could be invalidated or our competitors could design their products around our patented technology, and our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents or trademarks. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in other countries are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology, and the risk of intellectual property misappropriation may be higher in these countries. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being infringed or exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand into international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to our management and could result in the impairment or loss of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our\nintellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our technology, products, brand and business.\nWe will likely be subject to third-party intellectual property infringement claims.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity and litigation in our industry. Our success depends upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry.\nCertain technology necessary for us to provide our products may be patented, copyrighted or otherwise protected by other parties either now or in the future. In such case, we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology. We may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable, or at all. The existence of such a patent, copyright or other protections, or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using such technology and offering products incorporating such technology.\nOthers in the future may claim that our products and underlying technology infringe upon or violate their intellectual property rights. However, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or products. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, require that we refrain from using, manufacturing or selling certain offerings or features or using certain processes, prevent us from offering our products or certain features thereof, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, any of which could harm our business and operating results. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners and pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties for third-party claims with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, certain claims related to third-party privacy or cyber security breaches or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breach could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we often contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could be expensive, even if we ultimately prevail, and could harm our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our products and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, a decline in sales, increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances and may engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities. We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $55.5 million in principal amount outstanding under the term loan. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAny debt financing obtained by us in the future could cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities and could be secured by all of our assets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. In order for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants that, among others, limit our ability to:\n\u2022pay dividends and make distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022incur indebtedness not under the credit facility;\n\u2022engage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022make loans and guarantee obligations of other persons;\n\u2022amend material agreements and organizational documents and enter into agreement affecting ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022maintain or contribute to a defined employee benefit plan or arrangement that is not subject to the laws of the U.S.; and\n\u2022sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and engage in specified mergers or consolidations.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a consolidated total leverage ratio and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio that come into effect in March 2022. Our ability to borrow under the revolving facility depends on our compliance with these financial covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet these financial covenants. We cannot guarantee that we will meet these financial covenants in the future, or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet these financial covenants.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nAlleged or actual failure by us, our competitors, or other companies to comply with the constantly evolving legal and contractual environment surrounding calling or texting, and the governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe legal and contractual environment surrounding calling and texting is constantly evolving. In the United States, two federal agencies, the FTC and the FCC, and various states have laws and regulations including, at the federal level, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, that restrict the placing of certain telephone calls and texts by means of automatic telephone dialing systems, prerecorded or artificial voice messages and fax machines. In addition, there are a series of federal and state laws that regulate marketing calls and texts. Some of these laws require companies to institute processes and safeguards to comply with applicable restrictions. The legal interpretation of certain of the requirements of these laws has been in dispute before the courts and federal agencies, including for example as part of pending FCC proceedings and a case currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. Some of these laws, where a violation is established, can be enforced by the FTC, FCC, State Attorneys General, or private party litigants. In these types of actions and depending on the circumstances, the plaintiff may seek damages, statutory penalties, or other fees.\nWe have designed our products to comply with applicable law. To the extent that our products are viewed by customers or potential customers as less functional, or more difficult to deploy or use, because of our products\u2019 compliance features, we may lose market share to competitors that do not include similar compliance safeguards. Our contractual arrangements with our customers who use our solution to place calls also expressly require the customers to comply with all such laws and to indemnify us for any failure to do so.\nAlthough we take steps to confirm that the use of our products complies with applicable laws, it is possible that the FTC, FCC, private litigants or others may attempt to hold our customers, or us as a software solution provider, responsible for alleged violations of these laws. To the extent any court finds that the products violated a controlling legal standard, we could face indemnification demands from our customers for costs, fees and damages with respect to calls placed using those products. It also is possible that we may not successfully enforce or collect upon our contractual indemnities from our customers. Defending such suits can be costly and time-consuming and could result in fines, damages, expenses and losses. Additionally, these laws, and any changes to them or the applicable interpretation thereof, that further restrict calling or texting consumers, adverse publicity regarding the alleged or actual failure by companies, including us, our customers and competitors, or other third parties, to comply with such laws or governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could result in a reduction in the use of our products by our customers and potential customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 12, 2018, the FCC issued an order concluding that certain text messaging services qualify as an \u201cinformation service\u201d under federal law and not a \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d The regulatory significance to us is that the FCC\u2019s decision gives wireless carriers additional flexibility to manage messaging traffic on their network, including by blocking traffic. Such blocking efforts by carriers may make it more difficult for our customers to use messaging services provided by us as a part of our overall communications and outreach solution for our customers. Thus, although SMS comprises only a small portion of our revenue base, our future availability as an effective tool for communication and outreach for our customers and their customers remains uncertain and could cause our products to be less valuable to customers and potential customers.\nPrivacy concerns and domestic or foreign laws and regulations may reduce the demand for our solution, increase our costs and harm our business.\nIn order to provide our products, we receive and store personal data from customers, and we may also collect and store personal data from or about potential customers and website visitors. We may share personal data with our service providers, such as cloud or other technical services providers, as necessary to provide the products. Various federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations as well as industry standards and contractual obligations govern the processing of personal data. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of personal data by online service providers is evolving in the United States and internationally. Privacy groups and government bodies, including the FTC, state attorneys general, the European Commission and European data protection authorities, have increasingly scrutinized privacy issues with respect to personal data, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. The United States and foreign governments have enacted and are considering laws and regulations that could significantly impact the processing of personal data. These include laws such as the EU GDPR and the CCPA.\nWe have made and continue to make changes to our data protection compliance program to address applicable legal requirements. We also continue to monitor the implementation and evolution of data protection regulations, but if we are deemed to not be compliant with applicable law, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties (such as restrictions on personal data processing) and our business may be harmed. We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal, financial, and other data.\nAdditionally, some laws might require us to disclose proprietary or confidential aspects of our products in a manner that compromises the effectiveness of our products or that enables our competitors or bad actors to gain insight into the operation of our technology, enabling them to copy or circumvent our products and thereby reducing the value of our technology.\nWe publish privacy policies, notices and other documentation regarding our collection, processing, use and disclosure of personal information and/or other confidential information. Although we endeavor to comply with published policies, certifications, and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving full compliance if our employees or vendors fail to comply with our published policies, certifications, and documentation.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to us and the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand for our products. Also, failure to comply with such laws may lead to significant fines, penalties or other regulatory liabilities, such as orders or consent decrees forcing us or our customers to modify business practices, and reputational damage or third-party lawsuits for any noncompliance with such laws. Our business could be harmed if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices, or those of our customers.\nFurthermore, privacy and data protection concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data or other types of protected data that may be subject to laws and regulations that is necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries or countries.\nThe European Union\u2019s GDPR may continue to increase our costs and the costs of our customers to operate, limit the use of our products or change the way we operate, expose us to substantial fines and penalties if we fail to comply, and has led to similar laws being enacted in other jurisdictions.\nOn May 25, 2018, the EU adopted the GDPR. The GDPR replaced the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as Directive 95/46/EC, and is intended to harmonize data protection laws throughout the EU by applying a single data protection law that is binding throughout each member state. We and many of our customers are subject to the GDPR based upon our processing of personal data collected from EU data subjects, such as our processing of personal data of our customers in the EU.\nThe GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger steep fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. The member states of the EU were tasked under\nthe GDPR to enact certain implementing legislation that would add to or further interpret the GDPR requirements and this additional implementing legislation potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations.\nGiven the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, our compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements will continue to require time, resources and review of the technology and systems we use to satisfy the GDPR\u2019s requirements. We have ongoing procedures to maintain GDPR compliance. We continue to deliver product features that enhance our data management and security in support of GDPR compliance.\nWhile we do not regularly transfer high volumes of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), there may be circumstances in which ex-EEA transfers of personal data, including to countries which European regulators do not recognize as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, are necessary to provide products to our customers or otherwise operate our business. In the event we conduct any such transfers of personal data, we may have to implement new or additional processes, transfer mechanisms, or tools to comply with the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws, which may result in increased operational costs. Additionally, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding transferring personal data outside of the EEA, the resolution of which may impact our ability to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States.\nGiven the complexity of operationalizing the GDPR, the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the relative lack of guidance in the interpretation of our numerous requirements, we and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by EU data protection authorities or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects. This risk will likely remain until there is more guidance on the GDPR, including as to implementing legislation enacted by the member states and enforcement actions taken by various data protection authorities.\nThe implementation of the GDPR has led other jurisdictions to amend, or propose legislation to amend, their existing data protection laws to align with the requirements of the GDPR with the aim of obtaining an adequate level of data protection to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the EU. Accordingly, the challenges we face in the EU will likely also apply to other jurisdictions outside the EU that adopt laws similar in construction to the GDPR or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity.\nThe CCPA and its amendments could increase our costs and the costs of our customers to operate, limit the use of our products or change the way we operate, and expose us to substantial fines and class action risk if we fail to comply, and lead to similar laws being enacted in other states.\nIn 2018, the State of California adopted the CCPA. The CCPA applies to certain for-profit entities doing businesses in California. We and our qualifying customers were required to comply with these requirements before the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information and creating new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California. As required by the statute, entities doing business in California have new and ongoing disclosure obligations to consumers for whom they hold or process personal data. Businesses must also provide consumers with the right to dictate how their personal information is used and shared. Complying with these obligations will involve continued expenditures that could increase as more consumers exercise their rights under the statute.\nThe CCPA also creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of provisions. The California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA by seeking statutory penalties for failure to comply with the act. For businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures, the CCPA also creates a private right of action for consumers whose personal data is subject to certain data breaches. This private right of action has the potential to create significant class action liability for businesses, like ours, that operate in California. To protect against these new risks, we may be necessary to change our insurance programs or take other business steps. The CCPA has been amended multiple times, and the California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA and is currently reviewing modifications to those regulations. Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and new CPRA regulations are expected to be introduced. The potential effects of the CCPA amendments, Attorney General implementation, and CPRA are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Other states may enact laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted comprehensive privacy laws, which will each become effective in 2023. We are continuing to assess the impact of these developments on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available.\nIncreased taxes and surcharges (including Universal Service Fund, whether labeled a \u201ctax,\u201d \u201csurcharge,\u201d or other designation) on our products may increase our customers\u2019 cost of using our products and/or increase our costs and reduce our profit margins to the extent the costs are not passed through to our customers, and we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and other taxes, surcharges and fees.\nThe applicability of federal, state, and local taxes, fees, surcharges or similar taxes to our products is complex and subject to interpretation and change. Based on analysis of our activities, we have determined that either we are directly obligated to collect and remit U.S. state or local sales or use taxes in certain U.S. states, municipalities or local tax jurisdictions depending on the state(s) in question and the location of our customers, among other factors. The taxing authorities may challenge our interpretation of the laws and may assess additional taxes, penalties and interests which could have adverse effects on the results of operations and, to the extent we pass these through to our customers, demand for our products. We are registered for collecting and remitting applicable taxes where such a determination has been made and such registration is required. We analyze our activities and revenue to determine if we are subject to taxes in additional jurisdictions. Based on such ongoing assessment of our U.S. federal, state and local tax collection and remittance obligations, we register for tax purposes in such jurisdictions we deem required and collect and remit applicable state and local taxes to these jurisdictions.\nFederal, state, and local taxing and regulatory authorities may challenge our position and may decide to audit our business and operations with respect to, for example, state or local sales, use, gross receipts, excise and utility user taxes, fees or surcharges, which could result in us being liable for taxes, fees, or surcharges, as well as related penalties and interest, above our recorded accrued liability or additional liability for taxes, fees, or surcharges, as well as penalties and interest for our customers, which could harm our results of operations and our relationships with our customers. In addition, if our international sales grow, additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, which would increase our exposure to liability.\nIf jurisdictions enact new legislation or if taxing and regulatory authorities promulgate new rules or regulations or expand or otherwise alter their interpretations of existing rules and regulations, we could incur additional liabilities. In addition, the collection of additional taxes, fees or surcharges in the future could increase our prices or reduce our profit margins. Compliance with new or existing legislation, rules or regulations may also make us less competitive with those competitors who are not subject to, or choose not to comply with, such legislation, rules or regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with state or local tax, fee or surcharge requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nOur ability to offer products outside the United States is subject to different regulatory and taxation requirements which may be complicated and uncertain.\nWhen we expand the sale and implementation of our solutions internationally, we will be subject to additional regulations, taxes, surcharges and fees. Compliance with these new complex regulatory requirements differ from country to country and are frequently changing and may impose substantial compliance burdens on our business. At times, it may be difficult to determine which laws and regulations apply and we may discover that we are required to comply with certain laws and regulations after having provided services for some time in that jurisdiction, which could subject us to liability for taxes, fees and penalties on prior revenues, and we may be subject to conflicting requirements. Additionally, as we expand internationally, there is risk that governments will regulate or impose new or increased taxes or fees on the types of products that we provide. Any such additional regulation or taxes could decrease the value of our international expansion and harm our results of operations.\nRequirements for us or our suppliers to pay federal or state universal service fund contribution amounts and assessments (either us paying directly or paying through our suppliers in the form of surcharges) for other telecommunications funds or taxes could impact the desirability and profitability of our products.\nApplicable requirements for us to pay to our suppliers, or in some instances to pay directly, federal or state universal service surcharge amounts and assessments for other telecommunications funds or taxes, continue to change over time and may impact the desirability and profitability of our products. For example, interconnected voice over internet protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) providers are generally required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund, and the contribution rates have increased in recent years. In addition, if we are unable to continue to pass some or all of the cost of these surcharges and assessments to our customers, our profit margins will decrease. Our surcharge and assessment obligations, whether made directly or indirectly, may significantly increase in the future, due to new interpretations by governing authorities, governmental budget pressures, changes in our business model or products or other factors.\nIf we do not comply with federal or state laws and regulations, to the extent applicable, we could be subject to enforcement actions, forfeitures, loss of licenses/authorizations and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our products.\nOur business is impacted by federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, we are registered with the FCC and began providing interconnected VoIP services in the second half of 2021. As an interconnected VoIP provider, we are subject to certain existing or potential FCC regulations. If we do not comply with federal or state laws and regulations, to the extent applicable to our interconnected VoIP or other services, we could be subject to enforcement actions, forfeitures, behavioral or operational remedies, and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our products. Any enforcement action, elements of which may become\npublic, would hurt our reputation in the industry, could impair our ability to sell our products to customers and could harm our business and results of operations.\nSome of the regulations to which we may be subject or which otherwise may impact our business (in whole or in part) include:\n\u2022the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered entities to assist law enforcement in undertaking electronic surveillance;\n\u2022contributions to federal or state Universal Service funds;\n\u2022payment of annual FCC regulatory fees based on our interstate and international revenues;\n\u2022rules pertaining to access to our products by people with disabilities and contributions to the Telecommunications Relay Services;\n\u2022911 and E911 requirements;\n\u2022TRACED Act requirements; and\n\u2022FCC rules regarding Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, which prohibit us from using such information without customer approval, subject to certain exceptions.\nIf we do not comply with any current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to additional and substantial fines and penalties (including those mentioned above), we may have to restructure our products, exit certain markets, accept lower margins or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nChanges in government regulation applicable to the collections industry or any failure of us or our customers to comply with existing regulations could result in the suspension, termination or impairment of the ability of us or our customers to conduct business, may require the payment of significant fines by us or our customers and could require changes in customer\u2019s businesses that would reduce the need for our products, or require other significant expenditures.\nMany of our customers operate in the collections industry, which is heavily regulated under various federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations. In particular, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), FTC, state attorneys general and other regulatory bodies have the authority to impose certain restrictions on the collections industry and to investigate a variety of matters, including consumer complaints against debt collection companies, and can bring enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties, consumer restitution, and injunctive relief. If we, or our customers fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, identity theft, privacy, data security, the use of automated dialing equipment, laws related to consumer protection, debt collection, and laws applicable to specific types of debt, it could result in the suspension or termination of the ability of our customers to conduct collection operations, which in turn would adversely affect us.\nAdditionally, new laws, rules or regulations, including changes to permissible communications in connection with consumer debt collection enacted by the CFPB, could limit the ability of certain of our customers to use our products or could potentially expose us or our customers to fines or penalties, which could reduce our revenues, or increase our expenses, and consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, new federal, state or local laws or regulations, or changes in the ways these rules or laws are interpreted or enforced, could limit the activities of us or our customers in the future and could significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. Compliance with this extensive regulatory framework is expensive and labor-intensive. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulation F, which implements the Final Debt Collection Practices Act and which took effect on November 30, 2021, governs third-party debt collectors and, among other things, limits the number of call attempts that a debt collector may make to a consumer to seven calls per account within a seven-day period. Once the debt collector makes actual contact with a consumer, the debt collector may not call the consumer again about that same account for a seven-day period. Adoption of the Regulation F Rule has required significant changes in the collection practices of some of our customers, and several of our customers have taken an even more conservative approach in their collection practices to ensure compliance with the rules, which has negatively impacted our revenue from these customers. We are not able to give any assurance that the effect of these new rules will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory changes to laws or policies related to loan deferment, forbearance, or forgiveness could have a material negative impact on the business operations and prospects of certain of our customers and as a result have a negative impact on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory changes to laws or policies related to loan deferment, forbearance, or forgiveness, including as a response to COVID-19, may have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 businesses. For example, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. In compliance with the CARES Act, payments and interest accruals on federal student loans were suspended until September 30, 2020, and subsequent Executive Orders have directed the Department of Education (\u201cED\u201d) to extend the suspension until May 1, 2022. While the CARES Act applies only to loans owned by the ED, several states announced various initiatives to suspend payment obligations for private student loan borrowers\nin those states. Additionally, on March 25, 2020, the ED announced that private collection agencies were required to stop making outbound collection calls and sending letters or billing statements to borrowers in default. Moreover, in April 2020, various restrictions around the servicing and collection of private education loans were enacted by certain states. There is additional uncertainty as to the future of student loan forbearance or forgiveness under President Biden\u2019s administration. President Biden has indicated a desire and a willingness to cancel federal student loan debt for certain individuals up to a threshold amount and there have been similar proposals in Congress.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act allowed borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to request temporary loan forbearance for federally-backed mortgage loans. Nevertheless, servicers of mortgage loans are contractually bound to advance monthly payments to investors, insurers, and taxing authorities regardless of whether the borrower actually makes those payments. While government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, recently issued guidance limiting the number of payments a servicer must advance in the case of a forbearance, loan servicers expect that a borrower who has experienced a loss of employment or a reduction of income may not repay the forborne payments at the end of the forbearance period. Additionally, loan servicers are prohibited by the CARES Act from collecting certain servicing related fees, such as late fees, during the forbearance plan period. They are further prohibited from initiating foreclosure and/or eviction proceedings under applicable investor and/or state law requirements.\nThese legislative and regulatory changes have had, and these and other changes that may be promulgated in the future, may have a negative impact on certain of our customers who service student loans or federally backed mortgage loans. In particular, forgiveness of outstanding loans or a suspension of loan payments and interest accruals may lead to a reduction in the demand for our customers\u2019 business, resulting in a corresponding reduction to our business. Due to the impact of new legislation and regulation, coupled with the additional uncertainty of the new presidential administration\u2019s student loan-related initiatives, we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of changes in law on our customers and consequently our financial results, business operations, or strategies. Until the future of loan servicing is decided, our customers in this industry will continue to experience increased uncertainty. Our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, LiveVox is qualified for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our shareholders may not have the same protections as those afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.\nFunds affiliated with Golden Gate Capital have sole voting and dispositive power over the securities held by LiveVox TopCo LLC, which controls a majority of the voting power of our Class A common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of our Board consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWhile we currently do not utilize any of these exceptions, we are qualified to do so. As a result, we may not have a majority of independent directors on our Board, our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees may not consist entirely of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees may not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nGolden Gate Capital controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nGolden Gate Capital beneficially owns approximately 73.34% of our common stock as of December 31, 2021.\nAs long as Golden Gate Capital owns or controls a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to significantly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our Board, any amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for Class A common stock.\nBecause our Certificate of Incorporation opts out of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating certain business combinations with interested stockholders, Golden Gate Capital may transfer shares to a third party by transferring their shares of Common Stock without the approval of our Board or other stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.\nGolden Gate Capital\u2019s interests may not align with our interests as a company or the interests of our other stockholders. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Golden Gate Capital and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other shareholders, such as investing in or advising businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that none of Golden Gate Capital, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or its affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Golden Gate Capital also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Golden Gate Capital may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and plan to, instead, retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth. In addition, the terms of our credit facility restrict our ability to pay dividends. Because we have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investor's investment in our company will be if the market price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A Common Stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that an investor pays.\nWe may amend the terms of the Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of Public Warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your Warrants could be increased, the Warrants could be converted into cash or stock, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur Warrants were issued in registered form under a Warrant Agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Warrant Agent, and us. Such Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of Public Warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is not unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Warrants, convert the Warrants into cash or stock, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant.\nWe may redeem your unexpired Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant; provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities as described above) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the Warrant holders. If and when the Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so (2) sell your Warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your Warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your Warrants.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;\n\u2022the requirement that directors may only be removed from the Board for cause;\n\u2022the right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the requirement that changes or amendments to certain provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the Common Stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a forum selection clause.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (1) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (2) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (3) action asserting a claim pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or our bylaws, or (4) action asserting a claim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the provision described in the preceding paragraph shall not apply to suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation further provides the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our decision to adopt a federal forum provision for suits arising under federal securities laws in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. However, such provision may not be enforceable under Section 22 of the Securities Act, and it may be possible for the Company to be sued in applicable state and local courts notwithstanding such provision.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nThe forum selection clause may discourage claims or limit stockholders\u2019 ability to submit claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. If a court were to determine the forum selection clause to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company (\u201cEGC\u201d) as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs for as long as we continue to be an EGC, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under SOX, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) 2024, the fifth anniversary of Crescent\u2019s IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We had net revenues during fiscal 2021 and 2020 of $119.2 million and $102.5 million, respectively. If we expand our business through acquisitions and/or continue to grow revenues organically, we may cease to be an EGC prior to the end of 2024.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an EGC can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an EGC. An EGC can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-EGSs, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an EGC, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an EGC nor an EGC that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risks\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow have varied, and may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period, or series of quarters or periods, should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly and annual results may harm the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include, without limitation:\n\u2022market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers and grow our business with existing customers;\n\u2022customer renewal rates;\n\u2022customer attrition rates;\n\u2022our ability to adequately expand our sales and service team;\n\u2022our ability to acquire and maintain strategic and customer relationships;\n\u2022the timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation, partnership or collaboration among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u2022network outages or security incidents, which may result in additional expenses or losses, legal or regulatory actions, the loss of customers, the provision of customer credits, and/or harm to our reputation;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022seasonal factors that may cause our revenues to fluctuate across quarters;\n\u2022inaccessibility or failure of our products due to failures in the products or services provided by third parties;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to our research and development efforts or in the acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022our ability to successfully integrate companies and businesses that we acquire and achieve a positive return on our investment;\n\u2022our ability to expand and effectively utilize our network of master agents, referral agents and other third-party selling partners;\n\u2022changes in accounting rules under current and future generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d);\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022increases or decreases in the costs to provide our products or pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;\n\u2022the level of professional services and support we provide our customers;\n\u2022fluctuations or changes in the components of our revenue;\n\u2022the addition or loss of key customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022compliance with, or changes in, the current and future domestic and international regulatory environments;\n\u2022the hiring, training and retention of our key employees;\n\u2022changes in law or policy that impact us or our customers or suppliers;\n\u2022the outcome of litigation or other claims against it;\n\u2022the ability to expand internationally, and to do so profitably;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms if and when needed; and\n\u2022advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud contact center software solutions and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. In addition to the United States, we may market and sell our products in international markets in the future. If economic conditions, including currency exchange rates, in these areas and other key potential markets for our solutions remain uncertain or deteriorate, customers may delay or reduce their contact center and overall information technology spending. If our customers or potential customers experience economic hardship, this could reduce the demand for our products, delay and lengthen sales cycles, lower prices for our products, and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenue, operating results and cash flows.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require substantial financial and management resources.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining these controls can also divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404, including any additional requirements once we are no longer an EGC, in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our securities. Additionally, once we are no longer an EGC, we will be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when we no longer qualify as an EGC, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock, Warrants, and Units could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported operating results.\nU.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our consolidated financial statements issued before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and will occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our reported financial results or the way we account for or conduct our business.\nFor example, in May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition rules under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which included a single set of rules and criteria for revenue recognition to be used across all industries. We adopted this standard in January 2019 using a full retrospective method. With the adoption of this standard, the timing of our commission expense recognition changed, which caused fluctuations in our operating results. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nFurther, in February 2016, the FASB issued new rules for leases under the ASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for both finance, previously known as capital, and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective method. With the adoption of this standard, we recognized right-of-use, or ROU, assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe application of any new accounting guidance is, and will be, based on all information available to us as of the date of adoption and up through subsequent interim reporting, including transition guidance published by the standard setters. However, the interpretation of these new standards may continue to evolve as other public companies adopt the new guidance and the standard setters issue new interpretative guidance related to these rules. As a result, changes in the interpretation of these rules could result in material adjustments to our application of the new guidance, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline, cessation or disruption of trading in our common stock and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nIn addition, certain factors have in the past and may in the future cause us to defer recognition of revenues. For example, the inclusion in our customer contracts of non-standard terms, such as acceptance criteria, could require the deferral of revenue. To the extent that such contracts become more prevalent in the future our revenue may be impacted.\nBecause of these factors and other specific requirements under U.S. GAAP for revenue recognition, we must have precise terms and conditions in our arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we deliver our products or perform our professional services. Negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle, and we may accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nAn active trading market for our securities may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities become delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nWe are subject to many hazards and operational risks that can disrupt our business, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the cloud contact center software business, including:\n\u2022damage to third-party and our infrastructure and data centers, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, explosions and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022security breaches resulting in loss or disclosure of confidential customer and customer data and potential liability to customers and non-customer third parties for such losses on disclosures; and\n\u2022other hazards that could also result in suspension of operations, personal injury and even loss of life.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses and the curtailment or suspension of our operations. For example, in the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, tropical storm, flooding or severe weather or catastrophic events such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack impacting our headquarters or any of the data centers we use, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system and service interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe are not insured against all claims, events or accidents that might occur. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which we are insured, or if we or our data center providers fail to reopen facilities damaged by such accidents or events, our operations and financial condition could be harmed. In addition to being denied coverage under existing insurance policies, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies or be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target.\nTo date, the growth in our business has been primarily organic, and we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. With respect to any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from these or any future acquisitions due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition, including legal claims arising from the activities of companies or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business to our products and contract terms, including due to disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties and additional costs and expenses associated with supporting legacy products and the hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022harm to our existing relationships with our partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022the loss of our or the acquired business\u2019s key employees;\n\u2022diversion of resources that could have been more effectively deployed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies and businesses we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of additional debt to fund such acquisitions, which could harm our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. We will continue to consider, evaluate and negotiate such transactions as we deem appropriate. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating, evaluating and negotiating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.", "PERMNO": 18549, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CRSA"}
