{"cik": "1025378", "company": "W. P. Carey Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to pay dividends could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties, including those enumerated below. These risk factors may have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual operating and financial results, and could cause such results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements. You should not consider this list exhaustive. New risk factors emerge periodically and we cannot assure you that the factors described below list all risks that may become material to us at any later time.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face active competition for investments.\nWe face active competition for our investments from many sources, including credit companies, pension funds, private individuals, financial institutions, finance companies, and investment companies. These institutions may accept greater risk or lower returns, allowing them to offer more attractive terms to prospective tenants. We believe that the investment community remains risk averse and that the net lease financing market is perceived as a relatively conservative investment vehicle. Accordingly, we expect increased competition for investments, both domestically and internationally. Further capital inflows into our marketplace will place additional pressure on the returns that we can generate from our investments, as well as our willingness and ability to execute transactions. In addition, the vast majority of our current investments are in single-tenant commercial properties that are subject to triple-net leases. Many factors, including changes in tax laws or accounting rules, may make these types of sale-leaseback transactions less attractive to potential sellers and lessees, which could negatively affect our ability to increase the amount of assets of this type under management.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 6\nA significant amount of our leases will expire within the next five years and we may have difficulty re-leasing or selling our properties if tenants do not renew their leases.\nWithin the next five years, approximately 19% of our leases, based on our ABR as of December 31, 2018, are due to expire. If these leases are not renewed or if the properties cannot be re-leased on terms that yield comparable payments, our lease revenues could be substantially adversely affected. In addition, when attempting to re-lease such properties, we may incur significant costs and the terms of any new or renewed leases will depend on prevailing market conditions at that time. We may also seek to sell such properties and incur losses due to prevailing market conditions. Some of our properties are designed for the particular needs of a tenant; thus, we may be required to renovate or make rent concessions in order to lease the property to another tenant. If we need to sell such properties, we may have difficulty selling it to a third party due to the property\u2019s unique design. Real estate investments are generally less liquid than many other financial assets, which may limit our ability to quickly adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. These and other limitations may affect our ability to re-lease or sell properties without adversely affecting returns to stockholders.\nWe are not required to meet any diversification standards; therefore, our investments may become subject to concentration risks.\nSubject to our intention to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are not required to meet any diversification standards. Therefore, our investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location, which could subject us to significant risks with potentially adverse effects on our investment objectives.\nBecause we invest in properties located outside the United States, we are exposed to additional risks.\nWe have invested, and may continue to invest, in properties located outside the United States. At December 31, 2018, our real estate properties located outside of the United States represented 37% of our ABR. These investments may be affected by factors particular to the local jurisdiction where the property is located and may expose us to additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nenactment of laws relating to the foreign ownership of property (including expropriation of investments), or laws and regulations relating to our ability to repatriate invested capital, profits, or cash and cash equivalents back to the United States;\n\u2022\nlegal systems where the ability to enforce contractual rights and remedies may be more limited than under U.S. law;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with conflicting obligations in various jurisdictions and the burden of observing a variety of evolving foreign laws, regulations, and governmental rules and policies, which may be more stringent than U.S. laws and regulations (including land use, zoning, environmental, financial, and privacy laws and regulations), including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union;\n\u2022\ntax requirements vary by country and existing foreign tax laws and interpretations may change (e.g., the on-going implementation of the European Union\u2019s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive), which may result in additional taxes on our international investments;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating expenses in particular countries or regions; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical risk and adverse market conditions caused by changes in national or regional economic or political conditions (which may impact relative interest rates and the availability, cost, and terms of mortgage funds), including with regard to Brexit (discussed below).\nThe failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of our operating infrastructure to support such international investments, could result in operational failures, regulatory fines, or other governmental sanctions.\nIn addition, the lack of publicly available information in certain jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) could impair our ability to analyze transactions and may cause us to forego an investment opportunity. It may also impair our ability to receive timely and accurate financial information from tenants necessary to meet reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental and regulatory agencies. Certain of these risks may be greater in less developed countries. Further, our expertise to date is primarily in the United States and certain countries in Europe. We have less experience in other international markets and may not be as familiar with the potential risks to investments in these areas, which could cause us and the entities we manage to incur losses.\nWe may engage third-party asset managers in international jurisdictions to monitor compliance with legal requirements and lending agreements. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may expose us, our operating subsidiaries, or the entities we manage to additional liabilities. Our operations in the United Kingdom, the European Economic Area, and other countries\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 7\nare subject to significant compliance, disclosure, and other obligations. The European Union\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\u201cAIFMD\u201d), as transposed into national law within the states of the European Economic Area, established a new regulatory regime for alternative investment fund managers, including private equity and hedge fund managers. Although AIFMD generally applies to managers with a registered office in the European Economic Area managing one or more alternative investments funds, if a regulator in Europe determines that we are an alternative investment fund manager, and therefore subject to the AIFMD, compliance with the requirements of AIFMD may impose additional compliance burdens and expense on us and could reduce our operating flexibility.\nWe are also subject to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar because we translate revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements (our principal exposure is to the euro). Our results of foreign operations are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (i.e., absent other considerations, a stronger U.S. dollar will reduce both our revenues and our expenses).\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017, initiating the process to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), which is currently scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019. The real estate industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of Brexit. Adverse consequences could include, but are not limited to: global economic uncertainty and deterioration, volatility in currency exchange rates, adverse changes in regulation of the real estate industry, disruptions to the markets we invest in and the tax jurisdictions we operate in (which may adversely impact tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions), and/or negative impacts on the operations and financial conditions of our tenants. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. As of December 31, 2018, 3.6% and 30.5% of our total ABR was from the United Kingdom and other European Union countries, respectively. Given the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the form of Brexit (including a potential \u201chard Brexit\u201d in which the United Kingdom would also give up full access to the European Union single market and customs union), we cannot predict how the Brexit process will finally be implemented and are continuing to assess the potential impact, if any, of these events on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in how LIBOR is determined, or the potential replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our interest expense.\nCertain instruments within our debt profile are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is a benchmark rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short term loans. Concerns regarding the accuracy and integrity of LIBOR, including the underlying methodology for calculating LIBOR, led the United Kingdom to publish a review of LIBOR in September 2012. The review made a number of recommendations, including the introduction of statutory regulation of LIBOR, the transfer of responsibility for LIBOR from the British Bankers\u2019 Association to an independent administrator, changes to the method of compilation of lending rates and new regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms for rate setting. Based on the review, final rules for the regulation and supervision of LIBOR by the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) were published and came into effect on April 2, 2013. On July 27, 2017, the FCA announced its intention to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021.\nWe cannot predict the impact of these changes, or any other regulatory reforms that may be enacted in other jurisdictions, to LIBOR. In addition, any other legal or regulatory changes made by the FCA or other governance or oversight bodies in the method by which LIBOR is determined or the transition from LIBOR to a successor benchmark may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR, all of which may discourage market participants from continuing to administer or to participate in LIBOR\u2019s determination and, in certain situations, could result in LIBOR no longer being determined and published. If LIBOR is unavailable after 2021, the interest rates on our LIBOR-indexed debt will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may result in higher interest obligations than under the current form of LIBOR. Further, the same costs and risks that may lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine. Any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 8\nWe may incur substantial impairment charges.\nWe may incur substantial impairment charges, which we are required to recognize: (i) whenever we sell a property for less than its carrying value or we determine that the carrying amount of the property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value; (ii) for direct financing leases, whenever the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying property has declined on an other-than-temporary basis; and (iii) for equity investments, whenever the estimated fair value of the investment\u2019s underlying net assets in comparison with the carrying value of our interest in the investment has declined on an other-than-temporary basis. By their nature, the timing or extent of impairment charges are not predictable.\nImpairments of goodwill could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently when required by GAAP. We are required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values. Our assessment of goodwill or other intangible assets could indicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred, resulting in a material, non-cash write-down of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future earnings.\nOur level of indebtedness could have significant adverse consequences and our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $6.4 billion, representing a leverage ratio of approximately 6.8. This consolidated indebtedness was comprised of (i) $3.6 billion in Senior Unsecured Notes (as defined in Note 11), (ii) $2.7 billion in non-recourse mortgage loans on various properties, and (iii) $91.6 million outstanding under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11). Our level of indebtedness could have significant adverse consequences on our business and operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may increase our vulnerability to changes in economic conditions (including increases in interest rates) and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and/or industry;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with comparatively less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to hedge our debt, or such hedges may fail or expire, leaving us exposed to potentially volatile interest or currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nany default on our secured indebtedness may lead to foreclosures, creating taxable income that could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed or on favorable terms.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow determines whether we will be able to (i) meet our existing or potential future debt service obligations; (ii) refinance our existing or potential future indebtedness; and (iii) fund our operations, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other important business uses. Our future cash flow is subject to many factors beyond our control and we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future sources of cash will be available to us on favorable terms, to meet all of our debt service obligations and fund our other important business uses or liquidity needs. As a result, we may be forced to take other actions to meet those obligations, such as selling properties, raising equity, or delaying capital expenditures, any of which may not be feasible or could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, despite our substantial outstanding indebtedness and the restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. which would exacerbate the risks discussed above.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit agreement and indentures may limit our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies.\nOur current credit agreement and the indentures governing our Senior Unsecured Notes contain financial and operating covenants that, among other things, require us to meet specified financial ratios and may limit our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest (e.g., subject to certain exceptions, our ability to consummate a merger, consolidation, or a transfer of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets to another person is restricted). These covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our debt agreements may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments, or other events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could result in the acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness and potentially other indebtedness. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated prior to maturity, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness or refinance such indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 9\nVolatility and disruption in the capital markets could materially and adversely impact us.\nThe capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which could make it more difficult to raise capital. If we cannot access the capital markets upon favorable terms or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments, including when an investment has not yet realized its maximum return, which could also result in adverse tax consequences and affect our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities and/or meet operational needs. Moreover, market turmoil could lead to decreased consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity, which may materially and adversely impact us, including our ability to acquire and dispose of properties.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition as well as the market price of our Senior Unsecured Notes.\nWe plan to manage our operations to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Our credit ratings could change based upon, among other things, our historical and projected business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot provide any assurance that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. If any of the credit rating agencies downgrades or lowers our credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed our rating on a \u201cwatch list\u201d for a possible downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for our rating is negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us and on our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations (including those under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, our Senior Unsecured Notes, or other similar debt securities that we issue) and to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, any such action could negatively impact the market price of our Senior Unsecured Notes.\nSome of our properties are encumbered by mortgage debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $2.73 billion of property-level mortgage debt on a non-recourse basis (including $1.85 billion of non-recourse mortgage debt that we assumed in the CPA:17 Merger), which limits our exposure on any property to the amount of equity invested in the property. If we are unable to make our mortgage-related debt payments as required, a lender could foreclose on the property or properties securing its debt. Additionally, lenders for our international mortgage loan transactions typically incorporated various covenants and other provisions (including loan to value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and material adverse changes in the borrower\u2019s or tenant\u2019s business) that can cause a technical loan default. Accordingly, if the real estate value declines or the tenant defaults, the lender would have the right to foreclose on its security. If any of these events were to occur, it could cause us to lose part or all of our investment, which could reduce the value of our portfolio and revenues available for distribution to our stockholders.\nSome of our property-level financing may also require us to make a balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make such balloon payments may depend upon our ability to refinance the obligation or sell the underlying property. When a balloon payment is due, however, we may be unable to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original loan, make the payment with existing cash or cash resources, or sell the property at a price sufficient to cover the payment. Our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time, such as the state of national and regional economies, local real estate conditions, available mortgage or interest rates, availability of credit, our equity in the mortgaged properties, our financial condition, the operating history of the mortgaged properties, and tax laws. A refinancing or sale could affect the rate of return to stockholders and the projected disposition timeline of our assets.\nCertain of our leases permit tenants to purchase a property at a predetermined price, which could limit our realization of any appreciation or result in a loss.\nWe have granted certain tenants a right to repurchase the properties they lease from us. The purchase price may be a fixed price or it may be based on a formula or the market value at the time of exercise. If a tenant exercises its right to purchase the property and the property\u2019s market value has increased beyond that price, we would not be able to fully realize the appreciation on that property. Additionally, if the price at which the tenant can purchase the property is less than our carrying value (e.g., where the purchase price is based on an appraised value), we may incur a loss. In addition, we may also be unable to reinvest proceeds from these dispositions in investments with similar or better investment returns.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 10\nOur ability to fully control the management of our net-leased properties may be limited.\nThe tenants or managers of net-leased properties are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. If a property is not adequately maintained in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease, we may incur expenses for deferred maintenance expenditures or other liabilities once the property becomes free of the lease. While our leases generally provide for recourse against the tenant in these instances, a bankrupt or financially troubled tenant may be more likely to defer maintenance and it may be more difficult to enforce remedies against such a tenant. In addition, to the extent tenants are unable to successfully conduct their operations, their ability to pay rent may be adversely affected. Although we endeavor to monitor compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of our properties on an ongoing basis, we may not always be able to ascertain or forestall deterioration in the condition of a property or the financial circumstances of a tenant.\nThe value of our real estate is subject to fluctuation.\nWe are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate. While the revenues from our leases are not directly dependent upon the value of the real estate owned, significant declines in real estate values could adversely affect us in many ways, including a decline in the residual values of properties at lease expiration, possible lease abandonments by tenants, and a decline in the attractiveness of triple-net lease transactions to potential sellers. We also face the risk that lease revenue will be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses and the debt service payments we incur. General risks associated with the ownership of real estate include:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in general or local economic conditions, including changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;\n\u2022\ncompetition for tenants and changes in market rental rates;\n\u2022\ninability to lease or sell properties upon termination of existing leases, or renewal of leases at lower rental rates;\n\u2022\ninability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax, real estate, zoning, or environmental laws that adversely impact the value of real estate;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire or life-safety requirements;\n\u2022\nuninsured property liability, property damage, or casualty losses;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating expenses or unexpected expenditures for capital improvements;\n\u2022\nexposure to environmental losses; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure and other factors beyond the control of our management.\nIn addition, the initial appraisals that we obtain on our properties are generally based on the value of the properties when they are leased. If the leases on the properties terminate, the value of the properties may fall significantly below the appraised value, which could result in impairment charges on the properties.\nBecause most of our properties are occupied by a single tenant, our success is materially dependent upon the tenant\u2019s financial stability.\nMost of our properties are occupied by a single tenant; therefore, the success of our investments is materially dependent on the financial stability of these tenants. Revenues from several of our tenants/guarantors constitute a significant percentage of our lease revenues. Our top ten tenants accounted for approximately 24% of total ABR at December 31, 2018. Lease payment defaults by tenants could negatively impact our net income and reduce the amounts available for distribution to stockholders. As some of our tenants may not have a recognized credit rating, these tenants may have a higher risk of lease defaults than tenants with a recognized credit rating.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or borrowers may cause a reduction in our revenue and an increase in our expenses.\nWe have had, and may in the future have, tenants file for bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy or insolvency of a tenant or borrower under one of our loan transactions could cause the loss of lease or interest and principal payments, an increase in the carrying cost of the property, litigation, a reduction in the value of our shares, and/or a decrease in our dividend.\nUnder U.S. bankruptcy law, a tenant that is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings has the option of assuming or rejecting any unexpired lease. As a general matter, after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings and prior to assumption or rejection of an expired lease, U.S. bankruptcy laws provide that, until such unexpired lease is assumed or rejected, the tenant or its\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 11\ntrustee must perform the tenant\u2019s obligations under the lease in a timely manner. However, under certain circumstances, the time period for performance of such obligations may be extended by an order of the bankruptcy court. If the tenant rejects the lease, any resulting claim we have for breach of the lease (excluding collateral securing the claim) will be treated as a general unsecured claim. The maximum claim will be capped at the amount owed for unpaid rent prior to the bankruptcy (unrelated to the termination), plus the greater of one year\u2019s lease payments or 15% of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease (but no more than three years\u2019 lease payments). In addition, due to the long-term nature of our leases and, in some cases, terms providing for the repurchase of a property by the tenant, a bankruptcy court could recharacterize a net lease transaction as a secured lending transaction. If that were to occur, we would not be treated as the owner of the property, but we might have rights as a secured creditor. Those rights would not include a right to compel the tenant to timely perform its obligations under the lease but may instead entitle us to \u201cadequate protection,\u201d a bankruptcy concept that applies to protect against a decrease in the value of the property if the value of the property is less than the balance owed to us.\nInsolvency laws outside the United States may not be as favorable to reorganization or the protection of a debtor\u2019s rights as in the United States. Our right to terminate a lease for default may be more likely to be enforced in foreign jurisdictions where a debtor/tenant or its insolvency representative lacks the right to force the continuation of a lease without our consent. Nonetheless, such laws may permit a tenant or an appointed insolvency representative to terminate a lease if it so chooses. In addition, in circumstances where the bankruptcy laws of the United States are considered to be more favorable to debtors and/or their reorganization, entities that are not ordinarily perceived as U.S. entities may seek to take advantage of U.S. bankruptcy laws (an entity would be eligible to be a debtor under the U.S. bankruptcy laws if it had a domicile, place of business, or assets in the United States).\nBecause we are subject to possible liabilities relating to environmental matters, we could incur unexpected costs and our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of a property may be negatively impacted.\nWe have invested, and may in the future invest, in real properties historically or currently used for industrial, manufacturing, and other commercial purposes, and some of our tenants may handle hazardous or toxic substances, generate hazardous wastes, or discharge regulated pollutants to the environment. Buildings and structures on the properties we purchase may have known or suspected asbestos-containing building materials. We may invest in properties located in countries that have adopted laws or observe environmental management standards that are less stringent than those generally followed in the United States, which may pose a greater risk that releases of hazardous or toxic substances have occurred. We therefore may own properties that have known or potential environmental contamination as a result of historical or ongoing operations, which may expose us to liabilities under environmental laws. Some of these laws could impose the following on us:\n\u2022\nresponsibility and liability for the cost of investigation and removal or remediation (including at appropriate disposal facilities) of hazardous or toxic substances in, on, or migrating from our property, generally without regard to our knowledge of, or responsibility for, the presence of these contaminants;\n\u2022\nliability for claims by third parties based on damages to natural resources or property, personal injuries, or costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances in, on, or migrating from our property; and\n\u2022\nresponsibility for managing asbestos-containing building materials and third-party claims for exposure to those materials.\nCosts relating to investigation, remediation, or removal of hazardous or toxic substances, or for third-party claims for damages, may be substantial and could exceed any amounts estimated and recorded within our consolidated financial statements. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances at any of our properties, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could (i) give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or (ii) otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral. In addition, environmental liabilities, or costs or operating limitations imposed on a tenant by environmental laws, could affect its ability to make rental payments to us. And although we endeavor to avoid doing so, we may be required, in connection with any future divestitures of property, to provide buyers with indemnifications against potential environmental liabilities.\nOur participation in joint ventures creates additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we have participated in joint ventures to purchase assets and we may do so in the future. There are additional risks involved in joint venture transactions. As a co-investor in a joint venture, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the property, joint venture, or our investment partner. In addition, there is the potential that our investment partner may become bankrupt or that we may have diverging or inconsistent economic or business interests. These diverging interests could, among other things, expose us to liabilities in the joint venture in excess of our\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 12\nproportionate share of those liabilities. The partition rights of each owner in a jointly owned property could reduce the value of each portion of the divided property.\nRevenue and earnings from our investment management business are subject to volatility, which may cause our investment management revenue to fluctuate.\nRevenue from our investment management business, as well as the value of our interests in the Managed Programs and distribution income from those interests, may be significantly affected by the results of operations of the Managed Programs. CPA:18 - Global has significant investments in triple-net leased properties substantially similar to those we hold. Consequently, the results of operations of, and cash available for distribution by, CPA:18 - Global are likely to be substantially affected by the same market conditions, and are subject to the same risk factors, as the properties we own. Historically, four of the 17 CPA programs temporarily reduced the rate of distributions to their investors as a result of adverse developments involving tenants.\nThe Managed Programs have fully invested the funds raised in their offerings, and as a result, we expect the structuring revenue that we earn for structuring and negotiating investments on their behalf to continue to decline. In addition, asset management revenue may be affected by factors such as changes in the valuation of the Managed Programs\u2019 portfolios. Further, our ability to earn revenue related to the disposition of properties is primarily tied to providing liquidity events for the Managed Programs, and our ability to do so under circumstances that will satisfy the applicable subordination requirements will depend on market conditions at the relevant time, which may vary considerably over time.\nFinally, each of the Managed Programs has incurred and may continue to incur, significant debt that, either due to liquidity problems or restrictive covenants contained in their borrowing agreements, could restrict their ability to pay revenue owed to us when due. In addition, the revenue payable to us under each of our advisory agreements with the Managed REITs is subject to its variable annual cap based on a formula tied to the assets and income.\nBecause the revenue streams from the advisory agreements we have with the Managed REITs are subject to limitation or cancellation, any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe advisory agreements under which we provide services to the Managed REITs are renewable annually and may generally be terminated by each Managed REIT upon 60 days\u2019 notice, with or without cause. Unless otherwise renewed, the advisory agreement with each of the Managed REITs is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not expire or be terminated. Upon certain terminations, the Managed REITs each have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase our interests in their operating partnerships at fair market value. If such right is not exercised, we would remain as a limited partner of the respective operating partnerships. Nonetheless, any such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nW. P. Carey is not currently registered as an Investment Adviser and our failure to do so could subject us to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nIf the SEC determines that W. P. Carey is an investment adviser, we will have to register as an investment adviser with the SEC pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act. Registration requirements and other obligations imposed upon investment advisers may be costly and burdensome. In addition, if we must register with the SEC as an investment adviser, we will become subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act, which requires: (i) fiduciary duties to clients; (ii) substantive prohibitions and requirements; (iii) contractual requirements; (iv) record-keeping requirements; and (v) administrative oversight by the SEC, primarily by inspection. If we are deemed to be out of compliance with such rules and regulations, we may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nWe depend on key personnel for our future success, and the loss of key personnel or inability to attract and retain personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends in large part on our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel, including our executive officers. The nature of our executive officers\u2019 experience and the extent of the relationships they have developed with real estate professionals and financial institutions are important to the success of our business. We cannot provide any assurances regarding their continued employment with us. The loss of the services of certain of our executive officers could detrimentally affect our business and prospects.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 13\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, judgments, and assumptions associated with these critical accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make significant subsequent adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. If our judgments, assumptions, and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends, or stock price may be materially adversely affected.\nOur charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control transaction.\nOur charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our Board to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to limit any person to beneficial or constructive ownership of 9.8%, in either value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our aggregate outstanding shares of (i) common and preferred stock (excluding any outstanding shares of our common or preferred stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes) or (ii) common stock (excluding any of our outstanding shares of common stock not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes). Our Board, in its sole discretion, may exempt a person from such ownership limits, provided that they obtain such representations, covenants, and undertakings as appropriate to determine that the exemption would not affect our REIT status. Our Board may also increase or decrease the common stock ownership limit and/or the aggregate stock ownership limit, so long as the change would not result in five or fewer persons beneficially owning more than 49.9% in value of our outstanding stock. The ownership limits and other stock ownership restrictions contained in our charter may delay or prevent a transaction or change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur Board may modify our authorized shares of stock of any class or series and may create and issue a class or series of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur charter empowers our Board to, without stockholder approval, increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue; classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock; and issue such shares of stock so classified or reclassified. Our Board may determine the relative rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of common stock or preferred stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers, and rights (voting or otherwise) senior to the rights of current holders of our common stock. The issuance of any such classes or series of common stock or preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\u201cMGCL\u201d) may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or impeding a change of control that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\n\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock), or an affiliate thereof, for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 14\n\u2022\n\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with all other shares owned or controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d becomes an interested stockholder. Our Board has, by resolution, exempted any business combination between us and any person who is an existing, or becomes in the future, an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and any such person. As a result, such person may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked, or repealed in whole or in part at any time and we may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we have elected to opt out of these provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws.\nAdditionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or our bylaws, to implement certain governance provisions, some of which we do not currently have. We have opted out of Section 3-803 of the MGCL, which permits a board of directors to be divided into classes pursuant to Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL. Any amendment or repeal of this resolution must be approved in the same manner as an amendment to our charter. The remaining provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price. Our charter, our bylaws, and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFuture issuances of debt and equity securities may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue debt or equity securities or incur additional borrowings in the future. Future issuances of debt securities would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation and additional issuances of equity securities would dilute the holdings of our existing common stockholders (and any preferred stock may rank senior to our common stock for the purposes of making distributions), both of which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nUpon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before common stockholders. If we incur debt in the future, our future interest costs could increase and adversely affect our liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe issuance or sale of substantial amounts of our common stock (directly, in underwritten offerings or through our ATM program, or indirectly through convertible or exchangeable securities, warrants, or options) to raise additional capital, or pursuant to our stock incentive plans, or the perception that such securities are available or that such issuances or sales are likely to occur, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. However, our future growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to raise additional capital, including through the issuance of equity securities. We are not required to offer any additional equity securities to existing common stockholders on a preemptive basis and our charter empowers our Board to make significant changes to our stock without stockholder approval. See the risk factor above titled \u201cOur Board may modify our authorized shares of stock of any class or series and may create and issue a class or series of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval.\u201d Our preferred stock, if any are issued, would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to common stockholders.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 15\nBecause our decision to issue additional debt or equity securities or incur additional borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature, or success of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, common stockholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities, or our incurrence of additional borrowings, will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume and market price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate or be adversely impacted by various factors.\nThe trading volume and market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and be adversely impacted in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results, earnings, or liquidity, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates, or those of any securities analysts;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher dividend yield for our common stock and would result in increased interest expense on our debt;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend policy;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, our tenants, or the REIT industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nour use of taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d) may cause the market to value our common stock differently than the shares of REITs that do not use TRSs as extensively;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to the amount of maturing debt in the near and medium term and our ability to refinance such debt and the terms thereof;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any additional indebtedness we incur or equity or equity-related securities we issue in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived conflicts of interest;\n\u2022\nchanges in key management personnel;\n\u2022\nour compliance with GAAP and its policies, including recent accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022\nour compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE;\n\u2022\nour compliance with applicable laws and regulations or the impact of new laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects of our tenants;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our REIT qualification;\n\u2022\nlitigation, regulatory enforcement actions, or disruptive actions by activist stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this Report or in subsequent reports that we file with the SEC.\nOur current or historical trading volume and share prices are not indicative of the number of shares of our common stock that will trade going forward or how the market will value shares of our common stock in the future.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 16\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident could be (i) an intentional attack, which could include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information; or (ii) an unintentional accident or error. We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. In addition, we may store or come into contact with sensitive information and data. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and outsourced. We have implemented systems and processes intended to address ongoing and evolving cyber security risks, secure confidential information, and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive, confidential and personal data. Although we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security, disaster recovery and other preventative and corrective measures, our security measures, may not be sufficient for all possible situations and could be vulnerable to, among other things, hacking, employee error, system error, and faulty password management.\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws in handling this information, including the new General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, we could face significant legal and financial exposure to claims of governmental agencies and parties whose privacy is compromised, including sizable fines and penalties. The primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure. A significant and extended disruption could damage our business or reputation; cause a loss of revenue; have an adverse effect on tenant relations; cause an unintended or unauthorized public disclosure; or lead to the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information; all of which could result in us incurring significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. In addition, the insurance we maintain that is intended to cover some of these risks may not be sufficient to cover the losses from any future breaches of our systems. We have implemented processes, procedures, and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. The release of confidential information may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals, business partners and/or regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include losses, penalties, fines, injunctions, expenses, and charges recorded against our earnings and cause us reputational harm, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain cash dividends, and certain agreements relating to our indebtedness may prohibit or otherwise restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends in the future may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this Report. More specifically, while we expect to continue our current dividend practices, we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain dividend levels in the future for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthere is no assurance that rents from our properties will increase or that future acquisitions will increase our cash available for distribution to stockholders, and we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements, capital plans, cash flow, or financial position;\n\u2022\nour Board, in its sole discretion, determines the amount and timing of any future dividend payments to our stockholders based on a number of factors, therefore our dividend levels are not guaranteed and may fluctuate; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law or regulators, as well as the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.\nFurthermore, certain agreements relating to our borrowings may, under certain circumstances, prohibit or otherwise restrict our ability to pay dividends to our common stockholders. Future dividends, if any, are expected to be based upon our earnings, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, debt service requirements, capital expenditure requirements for our properties, financing covenants, and applicable law. If we do not have sufficient cash available to pay dividends, we may need to fund the shortage out of working capital or revenues from future acquisitions, if any, or borrow to provide funds for such dividends, which would reduce the amount of funds available for investment and increase our future interest costs. Our inability to pay dividends, or to pay dividends at expected levels, could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 17\nRisks Related to REIT Structure\nWhile we believe that we are properly organized as a REIT in accordance with applicable law, we cannot guarantee that the Internal Revenue Service will find that we have qualified as a REIT.\nWe believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code beginning with our 2012 taxable year and that our current and anticipated investments and plan of operation will enable us to meet and continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Investors should be aware, however, that the Internal Revenue Service or any court could take a position different from our own. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a REIT for any particular year.\nFurthermore, our qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership, and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the quarterly asset tests under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions and Treasury Regulations will depend on the fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. While we believe that we will satisfy these tests, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case on a continuing basis.\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at corporate income tax rates and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code, we will:\n\u2022\nnot be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n\u2022\nbe subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax (for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2018), on our taxable income at regular corporate rates; and\n\u2022\nbe barred from qualifying as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year when we were disqualified.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. This adverse impact could last for five or more years because, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we will be taxed as a corporation beginning the year in which the failure occurs and for the following four years.\nIf we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments to pay the additional tax liability. Were this to occur, funds available for investment would be reduced. REIT qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations, as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we plan to continue to operate in a manner consistent with the REIT qualification rules, we cannot assure you that we will qualify in a given year or remain so qualified.\nIf we fail to make required distributions, we may be subject to federal corporate income tax.\nWe intend to declare regular quarterly distributions, the amount of which will be determined, and is subject to adjustment, by our Board. To continue to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. Generally, we expect to distribute all, or substantially all, of our REIT taxable income. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain the proposed quarterly distributions that approximate our taxable income and we may fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible expenditures (e.g., capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves, or required debt service or amortization payments). To the extent we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. We will also be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, in order to continue to\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 18\nqualify as a REIT, any C-corporation earnings and profits to which we succeed must be distributed as of the close of the taxable year in which we accumulate or acquire such C-corporation\u2019s earnings and profits.\nBecause certain covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to make required REIT distributions, we could be subject to taxation.\nOur existing debt instruments include, and our future debt instruments may include, covenants that limit our ability to make required REIT distributions. If the limits set forth in these covenants prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a REIT. If the limits set forth in these covenants do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT, but prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts.\nBecause we are required to satisfy numerous requirements imposed upon REITs, we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIn order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for such transactions. If our cash flows are not sufficient to cover our REIT distribution requirements, it could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, sell assets, or offer equity securities in order to fund the distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, and expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we must generally correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nBecause the REIT rules require us to satisfy certain rules on an ongoing basis, our flexibility or ability to pursue otherwise attractive opportunities may be limited.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders, and the ownership of our common stock. Compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, thereby limiting our opportunities and the flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require target companies to comply with certain REIT requirements prior to closing on acquisitions.\nTo meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures, or debt repayment; and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, sell assets, or raise equity to fund these distributions, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for such transactions.\nBecause the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit our ability to hedge effectively, the cost of our hedging may increase and we may incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit our ability to hedge assets and liabilities that are not incurred to acquire or carry real estate. Generally, income from hedging transactions that have been properly identified for tax purposes (which we enter into to manage interest rate risk with respect to borrowings to acquire or carry real estate assets) and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-U.S. operations, do not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the REIT gross income tests (such a hedging transaction is referred to as a \u201cqualifying hedge\u201d). In addition, if we enter into a qualifying hedge, but dispose of the underlying property (or a portion thereof) or the underlying debt (or a portion thereof) is extinguished, we can enter into a hedge of the original qualifying hedge, and income from the subsequent hedge will also not constitute \u201cgross income\u201d for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs could be subject to tax on\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 19\nincome or gains resulting from such hedges or expose us to greater interest rate risks than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in any of our TRSs generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for use against future taxable income in the TRSs.\nWe use TRSs, which may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we hold our non-qualifying REIT assets and conduct our non-qualifying REIT income activities in or through one or more TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us and income that is not distributed to us will generally not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our TRS interests and certain other non-qualifying assets to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets, we would lose tax efficiency and could potentially fail to qualify as a REIT.\nBecause the REIT rules limit our ability to receive distributions from TRSs, our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our TRSs may be limited.\nOur ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules we must comply with in order to maintain our REIT status. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate-related sources, which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our properties. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying income types. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs. Specifically, if our TRSs become highly profitable, we might be limited in our ability to receive net income from our TRSs in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.\nTransactions with our TRSs could cause us to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The Internal Revenue Code also imposes a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. We will monitor the value of investments in our TRSs in order to ensure compliance with TRS ownership limitations and will structure our transactions with our TRSs on terms that we believe are arm\u2019s-length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the TRS ownership limitation or be able to avoid application of the 100% excise tax.\nBecause distributions payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nCertain distributions payable by domestic or qualified foreign corporations to individuals, trusts, and estates in the United States are currently eligible for federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20%. Distributions payable by REITs, in contrast, are generally not eligible for this reduced rate, unless the distributions are attributable to dividends received by the REIT from other corporations that would otherwise be eligible for the reduced rate. This more favorable tax rate for regular corporate distributions could cause qualified investors to perceive investments in REITs to be less attractive than investments in the stock of corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of REIT stocks, including our common stock.\nEven if we continue to qualify as a REIT, certain of our business activities will be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.\nEven if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain (i) federal, state, local, and foreign taxes on our income and assets (including alternative minimum taxes for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2018); (ii) taxes on any undistributed income and state, local, or foreign income; and (iii) franchise, property, and transfer taxes. In addition, we could be required to pay an excise or penalty tax under certain circumstances in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT, which could be significant in amount.\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 20\nAny TRS assets and operations would continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our cash available for distributions to stockholders.\nWe will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 21%) on all or a portion of the gain recognized from a sale of assets formerly held by any C corporation that we acquire on a carry-over basis transaction occurring within a five-year period after we acquire such assets, to the extent the built-in gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the REIT election is in excess of our then tax basis. The tax on subsequently sold assets will be based on the fair market value and built-in gain of those assets as of the beginning of our holding period. Gains from the sale of an asset occurring after the specified period will not be subject to this corporate level tax. We expect to have only a de minimis amount of assets subject to these corporate tax rules and do not expect to dispose of any significant assets subject to these corporate tax rules.\nBecause dividends received by foreign stockholders are generally taxable, we may be required to withhold a portion of our distributions to such persons.\nOrdinary dividends received by foreign stockholders that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business are generally subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. Additional rules with respect to certain capital gain distributions will apply to foreign stockholders that own more than 10% of our common stock.\nThe ability of our Board to revoke our REIT election, without stockholder approval, may cause adverse consequences for our stockholders.\nOur organizational documents permit our Board to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to be a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.\nFederal and state income tax laws governing REITs and related interpretations may change at any time, and any such legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us and our stockholders.\nFederal and state income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time. Federal, state, and foreign tax laws are under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process, at the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and at various state and foreign tax authorities. Changes to tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could adversely affect us or our stockholders. We cannot predict whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations, and administrative interpretations applicable to us or our stockholders may be changed. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any such change will not significantly affect our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences to you or us.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws could have a negative impact on our business.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed a tax reform bill into law, referred to herein as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d which among other things:\n\u2022\nreduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (including with respect to our TRSs);\n\u2022\nreduces the rate of U.S. federal withholding tax on distributions made to non-U.S. shareholders by a REIT that are attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022\nallows for an immediate 100% deduction of the cost of certain capital asset investments (generally excluding real estate assets), subject to a phase-down of the deduction percentage over time;\n\u2022\nchanges the recovery periods for certain real property and building improvements (e.g., 30 years (previously 40 years) for residential real property);\n\u2022\nrestricts the deductibility of interest expense by businesses (generally, to 30% of the business\u2019s adjusted taxable income) except, among others, real property businesses electing out of such restriction; generally, we expect our business to qualify as such a real property business, but businesses conducted by our TRSs may not qualify, and we have not yet determined whether our subsidiaries can and/or will make such an election;\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 21\n\u2022\nrequires the use of the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property in the event a real property business elects to avoid the interest deduction restriction above;\n\u2022\nrestricts the benefits of like-kind exchanges that defer capital gains for tax purposes to exchanges of real property;\n\u2022\npermanently repeals the \u201ctechnical termination\u201d rule for partnerships, meaning sales or exchanges of the interests in a partnership will be less likely to, among other things, terminate the taxable year of, and restart the depreciable lives of assets held by, such partnership for tax purposes;\n\u2022\nrequires accrual method taxpayers to take certain amounts in income no later than the taxable year in which such income is taken into account as revenue in an applicable financial statement prepared under GAAP, which, with respect to certain leases, could accelerate the inclusion of rental income;\n\u2022\neliminates the federal corporate alternative minimum tax;\n\u2022\nimplements a one-time deemed repatriation tax on corporate profits (at a rate of 15.5% on cash assets and 8% on non-cash assets) held offshore, which profits are not taken into account for purposes of the REIT gross income tests;\n\u2022\nreduces the highest marginal income tax rate for individuals to 37% from 39.6% (excluding, in each case, the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income);\n\u2022\ngenerally allows a deduction for individuals equal to 20% of certain income from pass-through entities, including ordinary dividends distributed by a REIT (excluding capital gain dividends and qualified dividend income), generally resulting in a maximum effective federal income tax rate applicable to such dividends of 29.6% compared to 37% (excluding, in each case, the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income), although regulations may restrict the ability to claim this deduction for non-corporate shareholders depending upon their holding period in our stock; and\n\u2022\nlimits certain deductions for individuals, including deductions for state and local income taxes, and eliminates deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions (including certain investment expenses).\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders annually. As a result of the changes to U.S. federal tax laws implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our taxable income and the amount of distributions to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT status, as well as our relative tax advantage as a REIT, could change.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a complex revision to the U.S. federal income tax laws with impacts on different categories of taxpayers and industries, which will require subsequent rulemaking and interpretation in a number of areas. In addition, many provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, particularly those affecting individual taxpayers, expire at the end of 2025. The long-term impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the overall economy, government revenues, our tenants, us, and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may negatively impact the operating results, financial condition, and future business plans for some or all of our tenants. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may also result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding. There can be no assurance that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.\nRisks Related to a Potential Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (\u201cUPREIT\u201d) Reorganization\nThe UPREIT structure will make us dependent on distributions from the Operating Partnership.\nAs previously announced, we may reorganize into an UPREIT (the \u201cUPREIT Reorganization\u201d), in connection with which we will convert WPC Holdco LLC, our directly wholly-owned subsidiary that currently holds substantially all of our assets, into a limited partnership (the \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d). Following the consummation of the UPREIT Reorganization, we will own all or substantially all of the equity interests in the Operating Partnership, including all of the non-economic equity interests of the general partner thereof, and the Operating Partnership will own substantially all of the assets that we owned prior to the UPREIT Reorganization. Since we expect to conduct our operations generally through the Operating Partnership following the UPREIT Reorganization, our ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends will be entirely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Operating Partnership and the ability of the Operating Partnership to make distributions to us.\nIt is possible that factors outside our control could result in the UPREIT Reorganization being completed at a later time, or not at all, or that our board of directors may, in their sole discretion and without any prior written notice, cancel, delay or modify the UPREIT Reorganization at any time for any reason.\nAdoption of the UPREIT structure could inhibit us from selling properties or retiring debt that would otherwise be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.\nOne of the benefits of the UPREIT structure is that sellers of property may contribute their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership, which allows such sellers to realize certain\nW. P. Carey 2018 10-K - 22\ntax benefits that are not available if we acquired the properties directly for cash or shares of our common stock. In order to ensure such tax-deferred contributions, sellers of properties may require us to agree to maintain a certain level of minimum debt at the Operating Partnership level and refrain from selling such properties for a period of time. Agreeing to certain of these restrictions, therefore, could inhibit us from selling properties or retiring debt that would otherwise be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur interest in the Operating Partnership may be diluted upon the issuance of additional limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership.\nUpon the issuance of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership in connection with future property contributions or as a form of employee compensation, our interest (and therefore the interest of our stockholders) in the assets of the Operating Partnership will be diluted. This dilutive effect would remain if limited partnership units were redeemed or exchanged for shares of our common stock (although our interest in the Operating Partnership will increase if limited partnership units are redeemed for cash). The dilutive effect from property contributions in exchange for limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership is comparable to that from sales of shares of our common stock to fund acquisitions.\nThe UPREIT structure could lead to potential conflicts of interest.\nAs the ultimate owner of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, upon the admission of additional limited partners to the Operating Partnership, we may owe a fiduciary obligation to the limited partners under applicable law. In most cases, the interests of the other partners would coincide with our interests and the interests of our stockholders because (i) we would own a majority of the interests in the Operating Partnership and (ii) the other partners will generally receive shares of our common stock upon redemption of their limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, the interests of the other partners might conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. We currently expect that the operating partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership will provide that in the event of a conflict in the duties owed by us to our stockholders and the fiduciary duties owed by us to the limited partners, we will fulfill our fiduciary duties to the limited partners by acting in the best interests of our company.\nIn addition, our directors and officers have duties to us and our stockholders under Maryland law. At the same time, as the ultimate general partner of the Operating Partnership, we will have fiduciary duties to the limited partners in the Operating Partnership and to the other members in connection with our management of the Operating Partnership. The duties of our officers and directors in relation to us and our duties as the ultimate owner of the general partner in these two roles may conflict.", "PERMNO": 85763, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "WPC"}
