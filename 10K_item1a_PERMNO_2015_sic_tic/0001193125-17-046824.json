Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating To Our Business\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from BioGlue and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nBioGlue\u00ae Surgical Adhesive (\u201cBioGlue\u201d) is a significant source of our revenues, representing approximately 35% and 40% of revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\u25cf\nBioGlue is a mature product, our U.S. Patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012, and our patents in most of the rest of the world for BioGlue expired in mid-2013. Other companies may use the inventions disclosed in the expired patents to develop and make competing products;\n\u25cf\nOne other company has launched competitive products in 2016 and one other is in the process of doing so. These companies have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do and are well established in their markets. Companies other than these may also pursue regulatory approval for competitive products;\n\u25cf\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize BioGlue in certain countries other than the U.S. at the same rate as our competitors or at all. We also may not be able to capitalize on new regulatory approvals we obtain for BioGlue in countries other than the U.S., including approvals for new indications;\n\u25cf\nBioGlue contains a bovine blood protein. Animal-based products are increasingly subject to scrutiny from the public and regulators, who may have concerns about the use of animal-based products or concerns about the transmission of disease from animals to humans. These concerns could lead to additional regulations or product bans in certain countries; and\n\u25cf\nBioGlue is subject to potential adverse developments with regard to its safety, efficacy, or reimbursement practices.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from tissue preservation services and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nTissue preservation services are a significant source of our revenues, representing 37% and 43% of revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, if we are unable to:\n\u25cf\nSource sufficient quantities of some tissue types from human donors or address potential excess supply of other tissue types. We rely primarily upon the efforts of third-party procurement organizations, tissue banks, most of which are not-for-profit, and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue. Factors beyond our control such as supply, regulatory changes, negative publicity concerning methods of tissue recovery or disease transmission from donated tissue, or public opinion of the donor process as well as our own reputation in the industry can negatively impact the supply of tissue;\n\u25cf\nProcess donated tissue cost effectively or at all due to factors such as employee turnover, ineffective or inefficient operations, or an insufficiently skilled workforce;\n\u25cf\nCompete effectively in tissue preservation services, as our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, pricing, back-office automation, marketing and sourcing tissue; or\n\u25cf\nMitigate sufficiently the risk that processed tissue cannot be sterilized and hence carries an inherent risk of infection or disease transmission; there is no assurance that our quality controls will be adequate to mitigate such risk.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign governments and regulatory agencies have adopted restrictive laws, regulations, and rules that apply to our tissue preservation services. These include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nThe National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 or \u201cNOTA\u201d, which prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation, but allows for the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of human organs;\n\u25cf\nU.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment; and\n\u25cf\nEuropean Union directives, called the EUCTD, which require that countries in the European Economic Area take responsibility for regulating tissues and cells through a Competent Authority.\nAny of these laws, regulations, and rules or others could change, or the U.S., state, or foreign governments and regulatory agencies could adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future regarding tissue preservation services that could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the On-X acquisition.\nOn January 20, 2016, we acquired On-X, at a price of $128.2 million, subject to certain adjustments, which is the largest acquisition we have ever made. Pursuant to the acquisition, we borrowed $75.0 million through a senior secured credit facility, subject to certain restrictions on our business, and we issued shares of common stock worth, at the time, approximately $34.6 million.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, growth prospects, cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of the On-X acquisition continues to depend on a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\nThe success of our integration of the direct sales forces of On-X and CryoLife into a single sales force to sell, with limited exception, the entire suite of products of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to successfully manage independent sales representatives and distributor relationships, particularly internationally;\n\u25cf\nThe success of moving to a direct sales model with the On-X products in certain international markets;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to resolve unanticipated or undisclosed pre-existing On-X liabilities including any regulatory or quality issues;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to execute on existing On-X clinical trials in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers for On-X products; and\n\u25cf\nUnforeseen negative economic or market conditions impacting the On-X business.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially, adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. As a result of these or other factors, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including achieving anticipated sales, capitalizing on the FDA\u2019s approved reduced international normalized ratio (\u201cINR\u201d) indication and other growth opportunities, capturing market share from major competitors, all of whom are substantially larger and better resourced than CryoLife, or realizing expected synergies and costs savings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and negatively impact the price of our common stock. In addition, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we could experience an interruption or loss of momentum in our existing business activities, which could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from On-X and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nOn-X is a significant source of our revenues, representing 19% of revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\u25cf\nOur ability to achieve anticipated sales of On-X products;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to capitalize on the FDA\u2019s approved reduced INR indication;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to overcome high levels of inventory in certain markets;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to compete effectively with our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to manage the risks associated with less favorable contract terms for On-X products on consignments at hospitals with more bargaining power; and\n\u25cf\nChanges in technology that may impact the market for mechanical heart valve and transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR devices.\nOur revenues for the On-X AAP in Europe may be adversely affected by a temporary suspension of the On-X AAP\u2019s CE-Mark.\nOn November 22, 2016, the Company received a letter from G-Med, indicating that it was temporarily suspending the CE Mark for the On-X AAP in the EEA, due to an allegedly untimely plan by the Company to address certain technical documentation issues found by G-Med during a review and renewal of the design examination certificate for the On-X AAP. Failure to timely lift this suspension could have an adverse effect on On-X AAP revenue in 2017.\nOur investment in PerClot is subject to significant risks, and our ability to fully realize our investment is dependent on our ability to obtain FDA approval and to successfully commercialize PerClot in the U.S.\nIn 2010 and 2011, we entered into various agreements with SMI pursuant to which, among other things, we (a) may distribute PerClot in certain international markets and are licensed to manufacture PerClot in the U.S.; (b) acquired the technology to produce the key component in the manufacture of PerClot; and (c) obtained the exclusive right to pursue, obtain, and maintain FDA Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) for PerClot. The initial consideration under those SMI agreements was approximately $8.0 million paid in cash and stock. We made additional payments of $1.75 million through 2016 and may pay contingent amounts of up to an additional $1.0 million if certain U.S. regulatory and other commercial milestones are achieved. We may also pay SMI, subject to certain offsets, royalties on our future sales of PerClot that we manufacture.\nIn March 2014, we received approval of our investigational device exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) for PerClot from the FDA, pursuant to which we began, in the first half of 2015, our pivotal clinical trial for surgical indications in the U.S. The Company began enrollment in the trial in the second quarter of 2015 but later suspended enrollment pending consultation with the FDA regarding the trial protocol. These discussions resulted in two amendments to the trial protocol, the last of which was approved by the FDA in July 2016. The Company is in the process of conducting site start-up activities and resumed the enrollment process into the trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the goal of receiving PMA from the FDA in the first half of 2019. Under our agreements with SMI, SMI may seek to terminate our exclusive license to pursue, obtain, and maintain the PMA if we do not secure such approval for PerClot by October of 2017 and if the parties are unable to modify this provision of the agreement through contractually required negotiations. Even though the FDA has approved the revised protocol, we may not be able to continue, or may elect to discontinue, the PerClot IDE. Finally, under the terms of our resolution with Medafor, we are precluded from marketing, selling or distributing PerClot in the U.S. until February 8, 2019, even if we obtain FDA Premarket Approval for PerClot before that date.\nWe will not be able to sell PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. in future years unless, and until, we obtain FDA approval and only after the Medafor injunction has expired on February 8, 2019. Failure to obtain FDA approval could materially, adversely affect our financial condition, anticipated future revenues, and profitability. There is no guarantee that we will obtain FDA approval when anticipated, or at all. The estimated timing of regulatory approval for PerClot is based on factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, the pace of enrollment in the IDE and the approval process may be delayed because of unforeseen scheduling difficulties and unfavorable results at various stages in the IDE or the process. Management may also decide to delay or terminate our pursuit of U.S. regulatory approval for PerClot at any time due to changing conditions in our Company, in the marketplace, or in the economy in general.\nFinally, even if we receive FDA PMA for PerClot, we may be unsuccessful in selling PerClot in the U.S. as competing products may have penetrated the market by the time we receive FDA approval and have substantial market share or significant market protections due to contracts, among other things. We may also be unsuccessful in selling in countries other than the U.S. due, in part, to a proliferation in other countries of multiple generic competitors, SMI\u2019s breach of its contractual obligations, or the lack of adequate intellectual property protection or enforcement. Any of these occurrences could materially, adversely affect our future revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nReclassification by the FDA of CryoValve\u00ae SGPV may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV.\nIn October 2014 the FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to consider the FDA\u2019s recommendation to re-classify more than minimally manipulated (\u201cMMM\u201d) allograft heart valves from an unclassified medical device to a Class III medical device. The class of MMM allograft heart valves includes our CryoValve SG pulmonary heart valve (\u201cCryoValve SGPV\u201d). At the meeting, a majority of the advisory committee panel recommended to the FDA that MMM allograft heart valves be re-classified as a Class III product. We expect that the FDA will issue a proposal for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves, which will be subject to a public comment period before finalization. After publication of the reclassification rule, we expect to have thirty months to submit for an FDA Premarket Approval, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers. To date, the FDA has not issued a proposed reclassification for MMM allograft heart valves.\nWe have continued to process and ship our CryoValve SGPV tissues. However, if the FDA ultimately classifies our CryoValve SGPV as a Class III medical device, we anticipate requesting a meeting with the FDA to determine the specific requirements to file for and obtain a Premarket Approval, and we will determine an appropriate course of action in light of those requirements. If there are delays in obtaining the Premarket Approval, if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the Premarket Approval, or if the costs associated with these activities are significant, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows in future periods. In addition, we could decide that the requirements for obtaining a Premarket Approval make continued processing of the CryoValve SGPV infeasible, necessitating that we discontinue distribution of these tissues.\nOur investment in PhotoFix is subject to a variety of risks.\nIn April 2016 we exercised our option and acquired the PhotoFix product line from GBI. We began distribution of PhotoFix in the first quarter of 2015 and have continued to sell PhotoFix after the acquisition.\nSimultaneously with our acquisition of the PhotoFix product line, we entered into a Transition Supply Agreement with GBI, pursuant to which GBI will continue to manufacture product for us until we have completed the transfer of manufacturing operations to us (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d). During the Transition Period, we are reliant on GBI to produce quality products in the quantities we and our customers require. If GBI experiences quality, supply, or production challenges, its products could be subject to recall or other quality action; its business operations and/or its facilities that make the products could be shut down temporarily or permanently, whether by government order, natural disaster, or otherwise; and there may not be sufficient product to enable us to meet demand. Even though we have acquired PhotoFix, we may be unable to continue the manufacturing, marketing, or distribution of the product consistent with our current projections or within the time frame anticipated. Further, we may be unable to secure anticipated approvals from the FDA or international regulatory bodies to remove certain labelling restrictions or to be able to commercialize PhotoFix in key international markets, such as Europe. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissues are highly complex and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks. Any of the following could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows:\n\u25cf\nOur products and tissues may be recalled or placed on hold by us, the FDA, or other regulatory bodies. For example, in 2002 the FDA issued an order related to our cardiac patch, vascular, and orthopaedic tissues processed from October of 2001 until August of 2002 and, pursuant to that order, we recalled these tissues or placed them on quarantine hold. We no longer process orthopaedic tissues due, in part, to this recall;\n\u25cf\nOur products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients, which has exposed, and could in the future expose, us to product and tissue processing liability claims, and such claims could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny and inspections;\n\u25cf\nOur manufacturing and tissue processing operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny and inspections, including by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and these agencies could require us to change or modify our manufacturing operations, processes, and procedures;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory agencies could reclassify, reevaluate, or suspend our clearances and approvals to sell our products and distribute tissues, and European Notified Bodies have recently engaged in more rigorous regulatory enforcement activities and may continue to do so; and\n\u25cf\nAdverse publicity associated with our products or processed tissues or our industry could lead to a decreased use of our products or tissues, additional regulatory scrutiny, and/or product or tissue processing liability lawsuits.\nAs an example of these risks, in January 2013 we received a warning letter from the FDA related to the manufacture of our products and our processing, preservation, and distribution of human tissue, as well as a subsequent 2014 Form 483, after a re-inspection by the FDA related to the warning letter that included observations concerning design and process validations, environmental monitoring, product controls and handling, corrective and preventive actions, and employee training. Despite an FDA re-inspection in the first quarter of 2015, after which the FDA closed out the warning letter issued in 2013, we remain subject to further inspections and oversight by the FDA and, if the FDA is not satisfied with our quality and\nregulatory compliance, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuing additional Form 483s or warning letters, to more severe sanctions such as fines; injunctions; civil penalties; recalls of our products and/or tissues; operating restrictions; suspension of production; non-approval or withdrawal of approvals or clearances for new products or existing products; and criminal prosecution. Any further Form 483s, warning letters, recalls, holds, or other adverse action from the FDA may decrease demand for our products or tissues or cause us to write down our inventories or deferred preservation costs and could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nThe outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections might result in material changes to governmental regulation of various aspects of our business and operations or cause disruptions to our business.\nThe outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential and Congressional election might result in material changes to governmental regulation of various aspects of our business and operations. We devote significant operational and managerial resources to comply with existing laws and regulations. Different interpretations and enforcement policies of existing laws and regulations, the possible repeal of existing laws and regulations, as well as the enactment of new laws and regulations, could require additional operational and managerial resources and could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make significant changes to our products and operations.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the continued use of our products for specific approved uses. Generally, unless the products are approved or cleared by FDA for the alternative uses, the FDA contends that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products for such uses. Such limitations present a risk that FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales, marketing, and/or support activities, though designed to comply with all FDA requirements, constitute the promotion of our products for an unapproved use in violation of the FDCA. We also face the risk that the FDA or other governmental authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities. Investigations concerning the promotion of unapproved uses and related issues, are typically expensive, disruptive, and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of the law, we may face significant fines and penalties and may be required to change substantially our sales, promotion, grant, and educational activities. There is also a possibility that we could be enjoined from selling some or all of our products for any unapproved use. In addition, as a result of an enforcement action against us or our executive officers, we could be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe are heavily dependent on our suppliers to provide quality materials and supplies.\nThe materials and supplies used in our product manufacturing and our tissue processing are subject to stringent quality standards and requirements, and many of these materials and supplies are subject to significant regulatory oversight and action. If materials or supplies used in our processes fail to meet these standards and requirements or are subject to recall or other quality action, an outcome could be the rejection or recall of our products or tissues and/or the immediate expense of the costs of the manufacturing or preservation. In addition, if these materials and supplies are recalled or the related suppliers and/or their facilities are shut down temporarily or permanently, whether by government order, natural disaster, or otherwise, there may not be sufficient materials or supplies available for purchase to allow us to manufacture our products or process tissues. Any of these occurrences or actions could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on sole source suppliers and single facilities.\nCertain of the materials, supplies, and services that are key components of our product manufacturing or our tissue processing are sourced from single vendors. As a result, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with those vendors may be limited, and if those vendors experience operational, financial, quality, or regulatory difficulties, or those vendors and/or their facilities cease operations temporarily or permanently, we could be forced to cease product manufacturing or tissue processing until the vendors resume operations or alternative vendors could be identified and qualified. We could also be forced to purchase alternative materials, supplies, or services with unfavorable terms due to diminished bargaining power. We also conduct substantially all of our operations at two facilities-Austin, Texas for our On-X product line, and Kennesaw, Georgia for all of our other products. If one of these facilities ceases operations temporarily or permanently, due to natural disaster or other reason, our business could be substantially disrupted.\nOur existing insurance coverage may be insufficient, and we may be unable to obtain insurance in the future.\nOur products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury to patients using our products or tissues, and we have been, and may be, exposed to product and tissue processing liability claims. We maintain claims-made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product and tissue processing liability claims. Claims-made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect. In addition, our product and tissue processing liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages. Although we have insurance for product and tissue processing liabilities, securities, property, and general liabilities, it is possible that:\n\u25cf\nWe could be exposed to product and tissue processing liability claims and security claims greater than the amount that we have insured;\n\u25cf\nWe may be unable to obtain future insurance policies in an amount sufficient to cover our anticipated claims at a reasonable cost or at all; or\n\u25cf\nBecause we are not insured against all potential losses, natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely impact our business.\nAny product liability claim, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product insurance rates or our inability to secure coverage on reasonable terms, if at all. Even in the absence of a claim, our insurance rates may rise in the future. Any product liability claim, even a meritless or unsuccessful one, would be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business and result in adverse publicity, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, injury to our reputation and loss of revenue.\nIf we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of future product or tissue processing liability claims or future securities class action or derivative claims, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations. If we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future, we may be subject to additional future exposure from product or tissue processing liability or securities claims. Additionally, if one or more claims with respect to which we may become, in the future, a defendant should result in a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff(s), such verdict(s) could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets. If we are unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve any outstanding or any future claims, this will materially, adversely affect our financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Further, although we have an estimated reserve for our unreported product and tissue processing liability claims for which we do expect that we will obtain recovery under our insurance policies, these costs could exceed our current estimates. Finally, our facilities could be materially damaged by tornadoes, flooding, other natural disasters, or catastrophic circumstances, for which we are not fully covered by business interruption and disaster insurance, and, even with such coverage, we could suffer substantial losses in our inventory and operational capacity, along with a potential adverse impact on our customers and opportunity costs for which our insurance would not compensate us.\nAny of these events could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe operate in highly competitive market segments, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies with significant resources and may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our products and services is intensely competitive and significantly affected by new product introductions and activities of other industry participants. We face intense competition from other companies engaged in the following lines of business:\n\u25cf\nThe sale of mechanical, synthetic, and animal-based tissue valves for implantation;\n\u25cf\nThe sale of synthetic and animal-based patches for implantation;\n\u25cf\nThe sale of surgical adhesives, surgical sealants, and hemostatic agents; and\n\u25cf\nThe processing and preservation of human tissue.\nA significant percentage of market revenues from these products was generated by Baxter International Inc., Ethicon (a Johnson & Johnson Company), Medtronic, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, LivaNova PLC, Edwards Life Sciences Corp., C.R. Bard, Inc., Integra Life Sciences Holdings, or LifeNet. Several of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u25cf\nGreater financial and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing, acquisitions, and patent litigation;\n\u25cf\nEnhanced experience in, and resources for, launching, marketing, distributing, and selling products;\n\u25cf\nGreater name recognition as well as more recognizable trademarks for products similar to the products that we sell;\n\u25cf\nMore established record of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements;\n\u25cf\nMore established relationships with healthcare providers and payors;\n\u25cf\nLower cost of goods sold or preservation costs;\n\u25cf\nAdvanced systems for back office automation, product development and manufacturing, which may provide certain cost advantages; and\n\u25cf\nLarger direct sales forces and more established distribution networks.\nOur competitors may develop services, products or processes with significant advantages over the products, services and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop, and our products and tissues may not be able to compete successfully. If we are unable to successfully market and sell innovative and in-demand products and services, our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome. In addition, consolidation among our competitors may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. If we fail to compete effectively, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will suffer.\nWe may experience decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure experienced by our customers from managed care organizations and other third-party payers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates, and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nCertain of our products and technologies are subject to significant intellectual property risks and uncertainty.\nWe own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to our technologies, which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. In addition, we have certain proprietary technologies and methods that we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own or license.\nWe have obtained licenses from third parties for certain patents and patent application rights, including rights related to our PerClot technologies. These licenses allow us to use intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to these third parties. We do not control the maintenance, prosecution, enforcement or strategy for many of these patents or patent application rights and as such are dependent in part on the owners of the intellectual property rights to maintain their viability. Their failure to do so could significantly impair our ability to exploit those technologies.\nFurthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies. In addition, our technologies or products or services could infringe patents or other rights owned by others, or others could infringe our patents. If we become involved in a patent dispute, the costs of the dispute could be expensive, and if we were to lose or decide to settle the dispute, the amounts or effects of the settlement or award by a tribunal could be costly. For example, in 2015 we resolved a patent infringement case with Medafor related to technology we licensed from SMI. The settlement of that patent infringement case resulted in the continuation of an injunction prohibiting us from marketing, selling, or distributing PerClot in the U.S. until February 8, 2019. We incurred substantial attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in pursuing and defending that case, and only a portion of those fees and costs are subject to recovery through indemnification. Should we be forced to sue a potential infringer, if we are unsuccessful in prohibiting infringements of our patents, should the validity of our patents be successfully challenged by others, or if we are sued by another party for alleged infringement (whether we ultimately prevail or not), our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of others.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at other medical device or tissue companies. We may also hire additional employees who are currently employed at other medical device or tissue companies, including our competitors. Additionally, consultants or other independent agents with which we may contract may be or have been in a contractual arrangement with one or more of our competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to\nclaims that these employees or independent contractors have used or disclosed any party\u2019s trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to market existing or new products, which could severely harm our business.\nOur key growth vectors may not generate anticipated benefits.\nOur strategic plan is focused on four growth vectors, primarily in the cardiac surgery segment, which are expected to drive our business in the near term. These growth vectors and their key elements are described below:\n\u25cf\nNew Products - Drive growth through new products including the On-X heart valve;\n\u25cf\nNew Indications - Broaden the reach of certain of the Company\u2019s products, including the On-X heart valve and BioGlue, with new or expanded approvals and indications in the U.S. or in international markets;\n\u25cf\nGlobal Expansion - Expand the Company\u2019s current products and services into new markets, including emerging markets, and accelerate growth by developing new direct sales territories overseas; and\n\u25cf\nBusiness Development - Selectively pursue potential acquisition, licensing, or distribution rights of companies or technologies that complement CryoLife\u2019s existing products, services, and infrastructure and expand our footprint in the cardiac surgery space, such as the recent acquisition of On-X, as well as divestitures of certain of our non-cardiac surgery product lines, such as the HeRO Graft in 2016, and licensing of products developed internally with non-cardiac applications. To the extent the Company identifies new non-core products or additional applications for its core products, the Company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development or seek funding from outside sources to continue commercial development.\nAlthough management continues to implement these strategies, we cannot be certain that they will ultimately drive business expansion and enhance shareholder value.\nWe continue to evaluate expansion through acquisitions of, or licenses with, investments in, and distribution arrangements with, other companies or technologies, which may carry significant risks.\nOne of our growth strategies is to selectively pursue potential acquisition, licensing, or distribution rights of companies or technologies that complement CryoLife\u2019s existing products, services, and infrastructure. In connection with one or more of the acquisition transactions, we may:\n\u25cf\nIssue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us;\n\u25cf\nUse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u25cf\nIncur debt, including on terms that could be unfavorable to us or debt that we might be unable to repay;\n\u25cf\nStructure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to integrate, upgrade, or replace the purchasing, accounting, financial, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll, and regulatory compliance functions of an acquisition target;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to secure or retain the services of key employees related to the acquisition;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition; or\n\u25cf\nAssume material unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nAs an example of these risks, we recently acquired On-X, which we financed by incurring further debt, using cash on hand, and issuing additional equity securities. This acquisition poses many of the same risks as set forth above. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, including the inability to recover our investment or cause a write down or write off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets.\nOur charges to earnings resulting from acquisition, restructuring and integration costs may materially adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nWe account for the completion of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total estimated purchase prices to net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisitions, record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required in purchase accounting including the following:\n\u25cf\nWe will incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of certain of the intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions during such estimated useful lives;\n\u25cf\nWe will incur additional depreciation expense as a result of recording purchased tangible assets;\n\u25cf\nTo the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets;\n\u25cf\nCost of sales may increase temporarily following an acquisition as a result of acquired inventory being recorded at its fair market value;\n\u25cf\nEarnings may be affected by changes in estimates of future contingent consideration to be paid when an earn-out is part of the consideration; or\n\u25cf\nEarnings may be affected by transaction and implementation costs, which are expensed immediately.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness could:\n\u25cf\nLimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives, or other purposes;\n\u25cf\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u25cf\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u25cf\nMake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy, or the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nRestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u25cf\nExpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as most of our borrowings are at a variable rate of interest.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nIncur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u25cf\nPay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our share capital or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf\nRepurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nTransfer or sell certain assets;\n\u25cf\nCreate liens on certain assets;\n\u25cf\nConsolidate or merge with, or sell or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of our assets to other companies;\n\u25cf\nEnter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u25cf\nPledge the capital stock of any of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nEnter into agreements which restrict our ability to pay dividends or incur liens;\n\u25cf\nMake material changes in our equity capital structure;\n\u25cf\nEngage in any line of business substantially different than that in which we are currently engaged; and\n\u25cf\nMake certain investments, including strategic acquisitions.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under our existing debt agreement. If we default on the terms of such debt agreements and the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nUnder our existing credit agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our existing debt agreement could result in an event of default under such agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. In the event of any default under our existing debt agreement, the holders of our indebtedness thereunder:\n\u25cf\nWill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u25cf\nCould elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; or\n\u25cf\nCould require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our existing debt agreements were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks as we seek to expand our business globally.\nThe expansion of our international operations is subject to a number of risks, which may vary significantly from the risks we face in our U.S. operations, including:\n\u25cf\nDifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including foreign distributor relationships and developing direct sales operations in key foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nExpanded compliance obligations, including obligations associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Law, local anti-corruption laws, and Office of Foreign Asset Control administered sanction programs;\n\u25cf\nBroader exposure to corruption;\n\u25cf\nOverlapping and potentially conflicting international legal and regulatory requirements, as well as unexpected changes in international legal and regulatory requirements or reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u25cf\nLonger accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries and additional cost of collection of those receivables;\n\u25cf\nDiminished protection for intellectual property and the presence of a growing number of generic or smaller competitors in some countries;\n\u25cf\nChanges in currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the British Pound and Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar, including any fluctuations in exchange rates due to the exit of the U.K. from the European Union;\n\u25cf\nDiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25cf\nAdverse economic or political changes or political instability;\n\u25cf\nPotential trade restrictions, exchange controls, and import and export licensing requirements including tariffs; and\n\u25cf\nPotential adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures.\nOur failure to address adequately these risks could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel.\nOur business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, including qualified personnel with medical device and tissue processing experience, and senior management with experience in the medical device or tissue processing space, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our business and future operating results, including production at our manufacturing and tissue processing facilities, also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, operations, processing, marketing, sales, and support personnel for our operations. Our main facilities are in the Atlanta, Georgia area and Austin, Texas, where the local supply of qualified personnel in the medical device and tissue processing industries is limited. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we lose any key employees, if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately, or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, this could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nContinued fluctuation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could materially, adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our foreign product and tissue processing revenues are denominated in British Pounds and Euros and, as such, are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In addition, a portion of our dollar-denominated product sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars in order to purchase these products. We also have balances, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates of British Pounds and Euros or other local currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar could materially reduce our future revenues as compared to the comparable prior periods. Should this occur, it could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon a combination of sophisticated information technology systems and traditional recordkeeping to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information, intellectual property and, in some instances, patient data). We have also outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, including elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we manage a number of independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Our information technology and information security systems and records are potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors. Our information technology and information security systems are also potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage and market manipulation) and expertise. While we have invested significantly in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. For example, although we have taken security precautions and are assessing additional precautions to provide greater data security, certain data may be vulnerable to loss in a catastrophic event. We have only limited cyber-insurance coverage that will not cover a number of the events described above and this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations, and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. We thus have no insurance for most of the claims that could be raised and, for those where we have coverage, those claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they may use to trade in our securities.\nHealth care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material, adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 imposed significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3 percent excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales that commenced in January 2013. While this tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, and while the underlying legislation might be repealed or replaced as a result of the 2016 U.S. Presidential and Congressional election, there is no guarantee that the excise tax will not be reinstated. Most recently, on January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order titled \u201cMinimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal.\u201d The impact of this executive order and the future of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are unclear. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences are not fully understood. These proposals may affect aspects of our business. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur sales are affected by challenging domestic and international economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets, and demand for our products and tissue preservation services could decrease in the future, which could materially, adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for our products and tissue preservation services can fluctuate from time to time. In challenging economic environments, hospitals attempt to control costs by reducing spending on consumable and capital items, which can result in reduced demand for some of our products and services. If demand for our products or tissue preservation services decreases significantly in the future, our revenues, profitability, and cash flows would likely decrease, possibly materially. In addition, the manufacturing throughput of our products and the processing throughput of our preservation services would necessarily decrease, which would likely adversely impact our margins and, therefore, our profitability, possibly materially. Further, if demand for our products and/or tissue preservation services materially decreases in the future, we may not be able to ship our products and/or tissues before they expire, which would cause us to write down our inventories and/or deferred preservation costs.\nOur sales may also be affected by challenging economic conditions in countries around the world, in addition to the U.S., particularly in countries where we have significant BioGlue or On-X heart valve sales or where BioGlue or the On-X heart valve is still in a growth phase. These factors could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and profitability.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance.\nOur growth and profitability will depend, in part, upon our ability to complete development of, and successfully introduce, new products and services, or expand upon existing indications, which requires that we invest significant time and resources to obtain required regulatory approvals, including significant investment of time and resources into clinical trials. Although we have conducted clinical studies on certain products and services under development, which indicate that such products and services may be effective in a particular application, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute on these clinical trials or that the results we obtain from clinical studies will be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances.\nAs noted above, we are currently engaged in a Premarket Approval clinical trial for PerClot, as well as clinical trials in China for BioGlue and in the United States for the On-X valve. Each of these trials is subject to the risks outlined herein. We cannot give assurance that the relevant regulatory agencies will clear or approve these or any new products and services, or new indications, on a timely basis, if ever, or that the new products and services, or new indications, will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to demonstrate satisfactorily compliance with, or if the service or product fails to meet, the regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy, and quality, or the regulatory agency otherwise has concerns about our quality or regulatory compliance. Regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy, and quality may become more stringent due to changes in applicable laws, regulatory agency policies, or the adoption of new regulations. Clinical trials may also be delayed or halted due to the following, among other factors:\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated side effects;\n\u25cf\nLack of funding;\n\u25cf\nInability to locate or recruit clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\nInability to locate, recruit, and qualify sufficient numbers of patients;\n\u25cf\nRedesign of clinical trial programs;\n\u25cf\nInability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the product, tissues, or any other components required for clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nChanges in development focus; or\n\u25cf\nDisclosure of trial results by competitors.\nOur ability to complete the development of any of our products and services is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products and services based on innovative technologies. Such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems, manufacturing, or processing difficulties, and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development. Consequently, we may not be able to successfully introduce and market our products or services, or we may not be able to do so on a timely basis. These products and services may not meet price or performance objectives and may not prove to be as effective as competing products and services.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product, service, or application, or if we determine for financial, technical, competitive, or other reasons not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of any product, service, or application, particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital, this could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services. Even the successful commercialization of a new product or service in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing, under-utilized production capacity, and continuing research and development and education costs. The introduction of new products or services may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow-up studies on human patients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community.\nAll of these could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nThe success of certain of our products and preservation services depends upon relationships with healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals, many of our products and preservation services may not be developed and marketed to appropriately meet the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products and preservation services. The research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products and preservation services are dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and preservation services. Healthcare professionals assist us as researchers, marketing and training consultants, product consultants, and speakers. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these professionals and do not continue to receive their advice and input, the development and commercialization of our products and preservation services could suffer, which could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf healthcare providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our products, or if reimbursement policies change adversely, we may not be successful in marketing and selling our products or preservation services.\nMost of our customers, and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. Healthcare providers, facilities, and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products or implant our tissues if they are not adequately reimbursed for these procedures. Unless a sufficient amount of peer-reviewed clinical data about our products and preservation services has been published, third-party payors, including insurance companies and government agencies, may refuse to provide reimbursement. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is provided, it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals. Some third-party payors may impose restrictions on the procedures for which they will provide reimbursement. If healthcare providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for our products or preservation services or the screenings conducted with our products, we may not achieve significant market acceptance. Acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement, funding, and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country. We may not obtain approvals for reimbursement in a timely manner or at all.\nWe are subject to various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims privacy, and transparency laws, and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims, privacy and transparency laws and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare compliance laws. Healthcare compliance laws are broad, can be ambiguous and are complex, and even minor inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Possible sanctions for violation of these healthcare compliance laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers\u2019 compensation programs, and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws could result in a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability.\nAnti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of an individual or the ordering or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid, or other government-sponsored healthcare programs. We have entered into consulting agreements, speaker agreements, research agreements, and product development agreements with healthcare professionals, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. While these transactions were structured with the intention of complying with all applicable laws, including state anti-referral laws and other applicable anti-kickback laws, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties. We have also adopted the AdvaMed Code of Conduct into our Code of Business Conduct, which governs our relationships with healthcare professionals, including our payment of travel and lodging expenses, research and educational grant procedures, and sponsorship of third-party conferences. In addition, we regularly conduct training sessions on these principles. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of healthcare professionals who consult with us on the design of our products, perform clinical research on our behalf, or educate the market about the efficacy and uses of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with healthcare professionals who refer, or order, our products to be in violation of applicable laws and determine that we would be unable to achieve compliance with such applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the healthcare professionals we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for noncompliance.\nThe Federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. Government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) on behalf of the government has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors, violated the FCA, resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts, and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward.\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws require us to annually report in detail certain payments and \u201ctransfer of value\u201d from us to healthcare professionals, such as reimbursement for travel and meal expenses or compensation for services provided such as training, consulting, and research and development. This information is then posted on the website of the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d). Certain states also prohibit some forms of these payments, require adoption of marketing codes of conduct and regulate our relationships with physicians and other referral sources.\nThe scope and enforcement of all of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change, especially in light of the scarcity of applicable precedent and regulations. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in or interpretations of these laws, whether these changes will be retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nConsolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany health care industry companies, including health care systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows would suffer.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of the company. We may in the future become subject to such shareholder activity and demands. Such demands may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur acquired federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards will be limited or may expire, which could result in greater future income tax expense and adversely impact future cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards include acquired net operating loss carryforwards. Such acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of the Company\u2019s former subsidiaries Hemosphere, Inc. (\u201cHemosphere\u201d) and Cardiogenesis Corporation (\u201cCardiogenesis\u201d), as mandated by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company believes that its acquisitions of these companies each constituted a change in control, and that prior to the Company\u2019s acquisition, Hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered a change in control. The Company also acquired net operating loss carryforwards in the acquisition of On-X Life Technologies that are limited under Section 382. However, the Company believes that such net operating loss carryforwards from On-X will be fully realizable prior to expiration. The deferred tax assets recorded on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets exclude amounts that it expects will not be realizable due to these changes in control. A portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes for which management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards. Limitations on the Company\u2019s federal tax net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards could result in greater future income tax expense and adversely impact future cash flows.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results have resulted and will continue to result from numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nChanges in demand for the products we sell;\n\u25cf\nIncreased product and price competition, due to the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors, market conditions, the regulatory landscape or other factors;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the mix of products we sell;\n\u25cf\nAvailability of materials and supplies, including tissue used in preservation services;\n\u25cf\nOur pricing strategy with respect to different product lines;\n\u25cf\nStrategic actions by us, such as acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies;\n\u25cf\nEffects of domestic and foreign economic conditions and exchange rates on our industry and/or customers;\n\u25cf\nThe divestiture or discontinuation of a product line or other revenue generating activity;\n\u25cf\nThe relocation and integration of manufacturing operations and other strategic restructuring;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory actions that may necessitate recalls of our products or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products;\n\u25cf\nFailure of government and private health plans to adequately and timely reimburse the users of our products;\n\u25cf\nOur determination whether or not to pay cash dividends;\n\u25cf\nCosts incurred by us in connection with the termination of contractual and other relationships, including distributorships;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable in selected countries outside of the United States;\n\u25cf\nThe expiration or utilization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry-forwards;\n\u25cf\nMarket reception of our new or improved product offerings; and\n\u25cf\nThe loss of any significant customer, especially in regard to any product that has a limited customer base.\nWe have based our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, some of which are not within our control, the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. We believe the quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not always meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2015 our Board of Directors discontinued dividend payments on our common stock for the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, our shareholders may receive a return on their investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when they sell shares of our common stock that they own. Future dividends, if any, will be authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, including, among other things, our financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects. In addition, restrictions in our credit facility limit our ability to pay future dividends. We can provide no assurance of our ability to pay cash dividends in the future.\nProvisions of Florida law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders, which could affect our share price adversely and prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management.\nWe are subject to the Florida affiliated transactions statute, which generally requires approval by the disinterested directors or supermajority approval by shareholders for \u201caffiliated transactions\u201d between a corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d Additionally our organizational documents contain provisions restricting persons who may call shareholder meetings and allowing the Board of Directors to fill vacancies and fix the number of directors. These provisions of Florida law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management, prohibit or delay mergers or other changes of control transactions and discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 78876, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CRY"}
