Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. When considering an investment in our shares of Class A Common Stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this report.\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused, and is continuing to cause, severe disruptions in the worldwide and U.S. economies, including contributing to the reduced global and domestic demand for oil and natural gas, which has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business. If COVID-19 continues to spread or the response to contain or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic through the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, including the vaccines recently approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation, we cannot make any prediction as to the ultimate material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are volatile. Their prices at times since 2014 have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our\ncapital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Volatile and lower prices may also negatively impact our stock price.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production heavily influence our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. These hydrocarbons are commodities, and therefore, their prices may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids has been volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2020, the WTI spot price for oil declined from a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014 to -$36.98 per Bbl in April 2020. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020. During 2020, WTI spot prices ranged from -$36.98 to $63.27 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot price of natural gas ranged from $1.33 to $3.14 per MMBtu. Likewise, natural gas liquids, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have experienced significant declines in realized prices since the fall of 2014. The prices we receive for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce and our production levels depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022worldwide, regional and local economic and financial conditions impacting supply and demand;\n\u2022the level of global exploration, development and production;\n\u2022the level of global supplies, in particular due to supply growth from the United States;\n\u2022the price and quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs imports to and exports from the U.S.;\n\u2022political conditions in or affecting other oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids producing countries and regions, including the current conflicts in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe;\n\u2022actions of the OPEC and state-controlled oil companies relating to production and price controls;\n\u2022the extent to which U.S. shale producers become swing producers adding or subtracting to the world supply totals;\n\u2022future regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells;\n\u2022current and future regulations regarding well spacing;\n\u2022prevailing prices and pricing differentials on local oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation, gathering and processing availability;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022technological advances affecting fuel economy, energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u2022the effect of energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas;\n\u2022global or national health concerns, including health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have and may continue to reduce our cash flows and borrowing capacity. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our hydrocarbon reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A decrease in prices could render development projects and producing properties uneconomic, potentially resulting in a loss of mineral leases. Low commodity prices have, at times, caused significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and may cause us to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, our borrowing capacity could be significantly affected by decreased prices. A sustained decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could adversely impact our borrowing base in future borrowing base redeterminations, which could trigger repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement to the extent our outstanding borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids gas prices may cause a decline in the market price of our shares.\nAs a result of low prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we may be required to take significant future write-downs of the financial carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our proved and unproved properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to significantly write-down the financial carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, which constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are recorded.\nA write-down could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates, or if exploratory drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field-by-field basis, may exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If so, we would record impairment charges to reduce the capitalized costs of such field to our estimate of the field\u2019s fair market value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. These types of charges will reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe periodically assess our properties for impairment based on future estimates of proved and non-proved reserves, oil and natural gas prices, production rates and operating, development and reclamation costs based on operating budget forecasts. Once incurred, an impairment charge cannot be reversed at a later date even if price increases of oil and/or natural gas occur and in the event of increases in the quantity of our estimated proved reserves.\nIf oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time and all other factors remain equal, we may incur impairment charges in the future. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which they are recorded. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Credit Agreement may negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, including capital expenditures, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our Credit Agreement or any other obligation if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under the Credit Agreement is currently subject to a borrowing base of $360.0 million, as increased with the closing of the IRM Acquisition on January 7, 2021. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual redeterminations (on or about May 1 and November 1), as well as other lender-elective borrowing base redeterminations. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Reductions in estimates of our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves may result in a reduction in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement (if prices are kept constant). Reductions in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022lower commodity prices or production;\n\u2022increased leverage ratios;\n\u2022inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u2022changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering techniques;\n\u2022increased operating and/or capital costs;\n\u2022the lenders\u2019 inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base; or\n\u2022adverse changes in the lenders\u2019 practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $115.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement with a borrowing base of $240 million. When adjusted to include the IRM Acquisition on January 7, 2021, we had $260 million of long-term debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement with a borrowing base of $360 million. We may make further borrowings under the Credit Agreement in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement as a result of borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our production and estimated reserves will decline, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that may vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well, particularly horizontal wells. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise and may be less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our estimated future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional\nreserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of those reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by SEC regulations relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant decisions, complex analyses and assumptions in evaluating available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nOur actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance will likely materially affect the estimated quantities and the estimated value of our reserves. In addition, we may later adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nQuantities of estimated proved reserves are based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in the markets for these commodities may shorten the economic lives of certain fields because it may become uneconomical to produce all recoverable reserves in such fields, which may reduce proved reserves estimates.\nNegative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future estimated cash flows of those reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which may result in non-cash charges to earnings. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 51% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 40,577 MBOE will require an estimated $285.1 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The future development of our proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on successful drilling and completion results, future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts, as well as access to liquidity sources, such as the capital markets, the Credit Agreement and derivative contracts. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. Moreover, under the SEC regulations, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill or have a development plan to drill wells within a prescribed five-year period. The estimated reserve data assumes that we will make specified capital expenditures to timely develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures may vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves may not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves set forth in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2020 and 2019, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas unweighted arithmetic average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding prices and costs constant through the life of the properties. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as: the actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas; the actual cost of development and production expenditures; the amount and timing of actual production; and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and incurring expenses related to developing and producing oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for statutory income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our estimated reserves.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our leaseholds. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of a property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of properties in addition to the risk that they may not perform in accordance with our expectations. If properties we acquire do not produce as projected or have liabilities we were unable to identify, we could experience a decline in our reserves and production, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture drilling and completion activities associated with identified drilling locations may be adversely affected by factors that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling and completion, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of mineral leases for such locations.\nAlthough our management team has identified numerous potential drilling locations as a part of our long-range planning related to future drilling activities on our existing acreage, our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, which are beyond our control, including, the availability and cost of capital, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results (including the impact of increased horizontal drilling density and longer laterals), lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory permits and approvals and other factors. In addition, we may alter the spacing between our anticipated drilling locations, which could impact the number of our drilling locations, the number of wells that we drill, and the volumes of oil and gas we ultimately recover. As such, our actual drilling and completion activities, may materially differ from those presently anticipated. Accordingly, it is uncertain to what degree that these potential drilling locations will be developed or if we will be able to produce significant oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from these or any other potential drilling locations. Unless production is established, in accordance with the terms of mineral leases that are associated with these locations, such leases could expire.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions we or other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that we or they own.\nMany of our properties are in reservoirs that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations by us or other operators could cause depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and\nother activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells by us or other operators could cause production from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses and could adversely affect the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production from a given pad, which may cause volatility in our operating results. In addition, problems affecting one pad could adversely affect production from all wells on such pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production.\nThe unavailability or high cost of equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services used to drill and complete wells could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Our operations are concentrated in areas in which activity has increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, has increased, as have the costs for those items. In addition, to the extent our suppliers source their products or raw materials from foreign markets, the cost of such equipment could be impacted if the United States imposes tariffs on imported goods from countries where these goods are produced. Such shortages or cost increases could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur acquisition, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could limit growth or lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves. We expect to fund our 2021 capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and possibly through additional capital market transactions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of high-quality drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including: our proved reserves; the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our production is sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce reserves; and our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement decrease as a result of low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise equity and debt capital.\nMuch of the investor community has developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain public and private fund management firms, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and gas sector based on environmental, social and governance considerations. Certain other stakeholders have pressured private equity firms and commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects. Such developments have resulted and could continue to result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting our future financial results.\nWe have incremental cash inflows and outflows as a result of our hedging activities. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at attractive prices or our derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we often enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including swaps, collars, puts and basis swaps. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair value, and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly and our results of operations may be significantly and adversely affected because of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments. As our derivative instrument contracts expire, there is no assurance that we will be able to replace them comparably.\nDerivative instruments can expose us to the risk of financial loss in varying circumstances, including, but not limited to, when: production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments; the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price stated in the derivative instrument contract and actual prices received; or there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nFor additional information regarding our hedging activities, please see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and our small size puts us at a disadvantage in competing for resources.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive particularly in the Permian Basin of Texas where our properties and operations are concentrated. We compete with major integrated and larger independent oil and natural gas companies in seeking to acquire desirable oil and natural gas properties and leases and for the equipment and services required to develop and operate properties. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours, which makes acquisitions of acreage or producing properties at economic prices difficult. Significant competition also exists in attracting and retaining technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, landmen and other specialists, as well as financial and administrative personnel hence we may be at a competitive disadvantage to companies with larger financial resources than ours.\nFailure to complete additional acquisitions could limit our potential growth.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our ability to acquire and develop mineral leases and oil and gas properties with economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves. Without continued successful acquisition, of economic development projects, our current estimated oil and natural gas reserves will decline due to continued production activities. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties is an important component of our business strategy. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, management may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Our limited access to financial resources compared to larger, better capitalized companies may limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it may be more difficult to replace and increase our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we consider information available in the public domain and information provided by the seller. In the event publicly available data is limited, then, by necessity, we may rely to a large extent on information that may only be available from the seller, particularly with respect to drilling and completion costs and practices, geological, geophysical and petrophysical data, detailed production data on existing wells, and other technical and cost data not available in the public domain. Accordingly, the review and evaluation of businesses or properties to be acquired may not uncover all existing or relevant data, obligations or actual or contingent liabilities that could adversely impact any business or property to be acquired and, hence, could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. These issues may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental liabilities, title defects, unpaid royalties, taxes or other liabilities. If we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we may have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition that we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, assumptions related to future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are often inexact and subjective. As a result,\nwe may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales or operations.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations. Management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business opportunities and concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding acquired properties.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations, including our drilling operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to numerous significant operating risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022unanticipated, abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022significant mechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\n\u2022blowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u2022personal injuries and death;\n\u2022uninsured or underinsured losses; and\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties, reduced cash flows, serious injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, which could expose us to significant liabilities. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business and assets exposes us to significant compliance costs and liabilities.\nOur operations involving the exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment as well as protection of the environment, operational safety, and related employee health and safety matters. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating but not limited to the following: land use restrictions; delivery of our oil and natural gas to market; drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements; spacing of wells; air emissions; property unitization and pooling; habitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation; containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials; drilling permits; use of saltwater injection wells, which affects the disposal of saltwater from our wells; safety precautions; prevention of oil spills; operational reporting; and taxation and royalties.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is a significant cost of doing business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities; the issuance of injunctions that may restrict, inhibit or prohibit our operations; and claims of damages to property or persons.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we acquired or of other third parties. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our actual plugging and abandonment obligations may be more than our estimates. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but we estimate that they will be material. Environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells for which we are the operator. Federal, state and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations.\nConsequently, we could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have additional regulatory burdens imposed upon us that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nFrom time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the SDWA to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA completed a study finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. Other governmental reviews have also been recently conducted or are under way that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations. Further, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nMore recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (\u201cCWT\u201d) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.\nThe proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to operate. If the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling, completion and production activities in the areas where we operate.\nOur exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or freezing temperatures, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity from regional power outages or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the availability of and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases, investor pressure concerning climate-related disclosures, and lawsuits could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce as well as reductions in the availability of capital.\nStudies have found that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), impact the earth\u2019s climate. The U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of GHGs. On January 20, 2021, President Biden\u2019s first day in office, he signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish interim and final social costs of three GHGs: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and methane is a primary component of natural gas. The Biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify\naggressive climate action as the United States moves toward a \u201c100% clean energy\u201d economy with net-zero GHG emissions. These actions could result in increased costs and reduced demand for our products.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD and/or Title V permits under EPA\u2019s GHG Tailoring Rule for their GHG emissions also may be required to meet \u201cBest Available Control Technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations. In recent proposed rulemaking, the EPA is widening the scope of annual GHG reporting to include not only activities associated with completion and workover of natural gas wells with hydraulic fracturing and activities associated with oil and natural gas production operations, but also completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing, gathering and boosting systems, and transmission pipelines.\nWhile the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs in recent years, it has not adopted any significant GHG legislation. This is expected to change with the Democratic Party now in control of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the office of the President. In the absence of federal GHG legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged, aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions through cap-and-trade programs, which typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting GHGs. Any future laws or regulations that require reporting of, or otherwise limit emissions of, GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing GHG emissions, such as emissions control technologies, and monitor and report GHG emissions associated with our operations, any of which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. At this time, it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business.\nSeveral policy makers and political candidates have made, or expressed support for, a variety of more comprehensive proposals, such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs, as well as the more sweeping \u201cgreen new deal\u201d resolutions the U.S. Congress introduced in early 2019. As generally proposed, the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d includes (i) a cap-and-trade program capping overall GHG emissions on an economy-wide basis and requiring major sources of GHG emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances and (ii) a carbon tax, which would impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and the downstream uses of our products. The \u201cgreen new deal\u201d calls for a 10-year national mobilization effort to, among other things, transition 100% of the U.S. power demand to zero-emission sources and overhaul the U.S. transportation systems so that GHG emissions are eliminated as much as is technologically feasible. The enactment of any such legislation would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold in a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are primarily sold in two geographic markets in Texas which each have a fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids, it could have a material negative effect on the prices we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is a risk that refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast may be insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut-in of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of oil and natural gas.\nPotential future legislation or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may generally affect the taxation of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nIn past years, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key federal and state income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. For example, President Biden has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) an increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations and (ii) the elimination of tax subsidies for fossil fuels. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden administration. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which we operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction. The passage of any\nlegislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in federal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction could adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny change to government regulation or administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the exploration for, and the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation, and transportation of, oil and natural gas and related products and other associated matters. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of oil and natural gas exploration and development operations could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax laws, royalty regulations and government programs related to our oil and natural gas properties and the oil and natural gas industry generally will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our progress or cause delays.\nPermits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of exploration and development. There can be no assurance that the various government permits, leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiration. There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will not contain terms and provisions which may adversely affect our exploration and development activities.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not own or control. If these facilities or systems are unavailable, our oil and natural gas production can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, transportation and processing facilities owned by third parties. In general, we will not control these facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the hydrocarbons we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our hydrocarbons is dependent upon coordination among third parties that own transportation and processing facilities we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. This is more likely in areas with recent increased production, such as our Permian Basin area where we have significant development activities. These are risks for which we generally will not maintain insurance.\nWe operate or participate in oil and natural gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nIn some cases, we operate but own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and natural gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely\nhave to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nUse of debt financing may adversely affect our strategy.\nWe may use debt to fund a portion of our future acquisition, development and/or operating activities. Any temporary or sustained inability to service or repay such debt will likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to access financing markets and pursue our operating strategies, as well as impair our ability to respond to adverse economic changes in oil and natural gas markets and the economy in general.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot directly control the timing of exploitation. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOur ability to exercise influence over operations and costs for the properties we do not operate is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to acquisition, exploration or development activities. The success and timing of development, exploitation or exploration activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including but not limited to: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources; the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and the selection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing or able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner(s) or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment costs, as well as other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholders, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, data, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nWe are a holding company and the sole manager of EEH. Our only material asset is our equity interest in EEH and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from EEH to cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay taxes.\nWe are a holding company and the sole manager of EEH. We have no material assets other than our equity interest in EEH. We have no independent means of generating revenue. We expect EEH to reimburse us for our corporate and other overhead expenses, and to the extent EEH has available cash, we intend to cause EEH to make distributions to the holders of membership units of EEH (\u201cEEH Units\u201d), including us, in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and non-U.S. tax liabilities of Earthstone, Lynden Corp and Lynden US, if any, at assumed tax rates. We will likely be limited, however, in our ability to cause EEH and its subsidiaries to make these and other distributions due to the restrictions under the Credit Agreement. To the extent that we need funds, and EEH or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur principal stockholders hold substantial voting power of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nHolders of Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (\u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d), will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Subsequent to the IRM Acquisition, EnCap and Warburg Parties may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 49.4% and 17.0%, respectively, of our voting interests and, along with their affiliates, could limit the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs long as EnCap and certain of its affiliates continue to control a significant amount of our outstanding voting securities, they will have the authority to exercise significant influence over management and all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. Also, in any of these matters, the interests of our management team may differ or conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, EnCap and its affiliates may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential acquisition candidates or industry partners. EnCap and its affiliates may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nBold Holdings (controlled by EnCap) and its permitted transferees have the right to exchange their EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for our Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the EEH LLC Agreement.\nAs of March 1, 2021, there were approximately 34.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock that are issuable upon redemption or exchange of EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock that are held by Bold Holdings, a fund managed by EnCap, or its permitted transferees. Pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of EEH (the \u201cEEH LLC Agreement\u201d), subject to certain restrictions therein, holders of EEH Units and our Class B Common Stock are entitled to exchange such EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of our Class A Common Stock at any time. If so exercised, EnCap would own more than 50% of our Class A Common Stock and would therefore have the ability to control our Company.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock in subsequent offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock will have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock. Stockholders may not receive funds without selling their shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. In addition, the Credit Agreement does not allow EEH to\nmake any significant payments to us, which makes it highly unlikely that we would be in a position to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock.\nOur Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nUnder our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Board is authorized to cause Earthstone to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the date of this report. Also, our Board, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If the Board causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock would likely be subordinate to those of preferred holders and therefore could be adversely affected. The Board\u2019s ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise seek to acquire us. Shares of preferred stock issued by us could include voting rights, or even super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control Earthstone to the holders of the preferred stock. Preferred stock could also have conversion rights into shares of Class A Common Stock at a discount to the market price of the Class A Common Stock which could negatively affect the market for our Class A Common Stock. In addition, preferred stock could have preference in the event of liquidation of Earthstone, which means that the holders of preferred stock would be entitled to receive the net assets of Earthstone distributed in liquidation before the Class A common stockholders receive any distribution of the liquidated assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nThe price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect us and holders of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Adverse events including changes in production volumes, worldwide demand and prices for crude oil and natural gas, regulatory developments, and changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance could negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock. General market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of stocks generally could also have a similar negative impact. The stock markets regularly experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies\u2019 stock prices without regard to the operating performance of those companies. Volatility of this type may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition difficult.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified board of directors, with each member serving a three-year term. Provisions in our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the approval of our Board. In addition, the Delaware corporate statutes also contain certain provisions that could make an acquisition by a third-party more difficult.\nOur stockholders may act by unilateral written consent.\nUnder our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of our stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Thus, consents of this type can be effected without the participation or input of minority stockholders.", "PERMNO": 17073, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ESTE"}
