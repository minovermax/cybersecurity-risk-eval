RISK FACTORS\nOur past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nFactors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals, include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n1. The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to identify fashion trends as well as to react to changing customer demand in a timely manner and to generate positive cash from operations as a result.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing customer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner. The specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in customer preferences directed by trends and fashions. If we miscalculate our customers\u2019 product preferences or the demand for our products, we may be faced with excess inventory. Historically, this has resulted in excess fabric for some products and markdowns and/or write-offs of raw materials as well as finished goods, which has impaired our profitability, and may do so in the future. Similarly, any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing customer demands and fashion trends will adversely affect our business. In addition, from time to time, we may pursue new concepts, and if the new concepts are not successful, our business could be harmed. Starting the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company undertook a restructuring process in the design, merchandising and production functions, which could impact our domestic and international product assortment and selling. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 the Company entered into a strategic joint venture arrangement with Bluestar Alliance LLC (Bluestar). Under this partnership, bebe contributed all of its trademarks, trademark license arrangements and related intellectual property, including certain domain names to a newly formed joint venture (the Joint Venture) and received just over 50% ownership in the Joint Venture. Bluestar contributed the $35 million to the Joint Venture, and received just under 50% of the joint venture. This $35 million was paid to bebe at the time that the joint venture was formed.\nWe used $39 million, $25 million and $30 million net of our cash in operating activities in the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Our liquidity is dependent upon our ability to generate cash from operations along with usage of our existing cash and cash equivalents. Our strategic focus for fiscal 2017 is to continue implementing our strategy to streamline the production cycle for our product, make improvements to our product assortment, further rationalize our store fleet and inventory levels, and continued focus on discretionary spending. We believe our cash and equivalents, together with our cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months, provided that we can achieve the financial results anticipated as a result of the restructuring and cost-saving measures. Our future operating and capital requirements, however, will depend on numerous factors, including without limitation, the size and number of new and expanded stores and/or store concepts, investment costs for management information systems, the success of initiatives in the Joint Venture, potential investments and/or licensing arrangements, and future results of operations. The inability to generate positive cash flow from operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial conditions. In addition, if additional financing is needed, we may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms, or at all.\n2. The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand, image and reputation.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business as well as the implementation of strategies to expand it. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality client experience. In addition, while our brand is mature, our success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to shop our brand. Our business would be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives for our brand. In addition, failure to achieve consistent, positive performance or the receipt of any negative publicity could adversely impact our brand and the brand loyalty of our customers, which would adversely impact our business. Finally, our brand's image could be impacted by initiatives within the Joint Venture.\n3. We face significant competition in the retail and apparel industries, which could harm our business.\nThe retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry. We expect competition in our markets to increase. The primary competitive factors in our markets are: brand name recognition and appeal, sourcing, product styling, quality, presentation and pricing, timeliness of product development and delivery, store ambiance, customer service and convenience. We compete with traditional department stores, specialty store retailers, lower price point retailers, business-to-consumer websites, off-price retailers and direct marketers for, among other things, raw materials, market share, retail space, finished goods, sourcing and personnel. Because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially\ngreater financial, distribution and marketing resources than we do or maintain comparatively lower cost of operations, we may lack the resources to effectively compete with them. If we fail to remain competitive in any way, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to address the challenges of declining store traffic in a highly promotional, low growth environment, our business will be negatively affected.\n4. Our business has recently undergone significant changes, including management, personnel and business changes. If we do not effectively and successfully adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring our third fiscal quarter of 2016, we replaced our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we eliminated approximately 81 other positions in an effort to streamline our business and control costs. As a result, we have also made significant operational changes. These significant changes have created additional pressures on existing personnel, and we have been working to adapt to operating our business in a manner that differs meaningfully from prior periods. We cannot assure that these changes will lead to the desired improvement in our business and results of operations. If we do not effectively and successfully adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n5. General economic conditions, including increases in energy and commodity prices, that are largely out of our control, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our products is influenced by national and local economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits. Factors that could adversely affect the demand for our products include recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, deflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws. A decline in economic conditions could also result in reduced traffic in our stores or limitations on the prices we can charge for our products, either of which could adversely affect our business. We can provide no assurance that demand for our products will not be adversely affected by national or local economic conditions, thereby harming our business. In addition, economic factors such as those listed above and increased transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, and changes in other laws and regulations may increase our cost of sales and our operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Any such increase would also negatively impact our business, including our financial results.\n6. We cannot assure you that future store openings will be successful and new store openings may impact existing stores.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the stores we opened in fiscal 2016, or any other stores that we might open in the future, will be successful or that our overall results will improve as a result of opening these stores. In addition, new store openings have the potential to cannibalize the net sales and profitability of other existing stores, and can take time to achieve positive financial results.\nThe success of a future store depends on our ability to effectively obtain real estate that meets our criteria, including traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, average sales per square foot, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, continued consolidation in the commercial retail real estate market could affect our ability to successfully negotiate favorable rental terms for our stores in the future. Should significant consolidation continue, a large proportion of our store base could be concentrated with one or a few landlords that would then be in a position to dictate unfavorable terms to us due to their significant negotiating leverage. For example we have approximately 35 stores with lease renewals in fiscal 2017, which are currently being negotiated. If we are unable to negotiate favorable lease terms with these entities, this could affect our ability to profitably operate our stores, which would adversely impact our business.\n7. We are dependent on the success of shopping malls in which our stores are located.\nMany of our stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers that benefit from the ability of \u201canchor\u201d retail tenants, generally large department stores, and other attractions, to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at shopping centers, whether because of the economic slowdown, a decline in the popularity of shopping centers, the closing of anchor stores, consumer preferences to shop on the internet or at large warehouse stores or otherwise, could result in reduced sales at our stores and excess inventory. We may have to respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or business.\n8. We may be forced to close stores or write down store assets that are not able to achieve planned financial performance, which may force us to record losses in future quarters.\nThe results achieved by our stores may not be indicative of long-term performance or the potential performance of stores in other locations. The failure of stores to achieve acceptable results could result in additional store asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our business. In the past, we have had to close stores as a result of poor performance. For example, in fiscal year 2016, we closed 21 stores. Additionally, a limited number of stores are not performing to our expected levels, and we may choose to close these stores in the future. If we choose to close these stores, but cannot negotiate favorable terms with the landlords of these stores regarding the remaining lease obligations, our financial results could be adversely\naffected. Closing stores because of poor performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, and the resulting impairment and other charges would have an adverse impact on our financial results.\n9. Our sales, margins and operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations.\nOur business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries, such as the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in our second fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season, compared to other quarters.\nIn addition, our quarterly comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our customer base, managing inventory effectively and optimizing store performance by closing under-performing stores. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n10. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees in order to support our existing businesses and future expansion.\nFrom time to time we actively recruit qualified candidates to fill key executive positions within our Company. There is substantial competition for experienced personnel, which we expect will continue. We compete for experienced personnel with companies who may have greater financial resources than we do. During fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 we experienced significant turnover of our executive management team as part of several restructurings. In light of these changes in people and processes, we might continue to experience turnover. We are also exposed to employment litigation due to our large number of employees and high turnover of our sales associates. If we fail to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, it could harm our business and limit our ability to expand.\n11. Our business could be adversely impacted by unfavorable international political conditions.\nOur sales and operating results are, and will continue to be, affected by international social, political, legal and economic conditions. In particular, our business could be adversely impacted by instability or changes resulting in the disruption of trade with the countries in which our contractors, suppliers, licensees or customers are located, significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments. We can provide no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by such international events.\nIn addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes and customs restrictions could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business. We also purchase a substantial amount of our raw materials from China, and our business and operating results may be affected by changes in the political, social or economic environment in China.\n12. Our ability to conduct business could be negatively impacted by the effects of natural disasters, war, terrorism, public health concerns or other catastrophes.\nWe operate a corporate office in Brisbane, California, a distribution facility in Benicia, California, a design studio in Los Angeles, California and a distribution facility in Hong Kong. Any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to construction, relocation, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorist acts or otherwise could harm our business. Natural disasters, extreme weather and public health concerns, including severe infectious diseases, could impact our ability to open and run our corporate offices, distribution center, stores and other operations in affected areas and/or negatively impact our foreign sourcing offices and the operations of our vendors. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends, in part, on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Lower client traffic due to the effect of natural disasters or extreme weather, security concerns, war or the threat of war and public health concerns could result in decreased sales that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events in the United States and world-wide could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, disrupt the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise or lead to lower client traffic. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster or other catastrophic situation. In addition, although we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us.\n13. If we, through our interest in the Joint Venture are not able to protect our intellectual property our business may be harmed.\nAlthough we and the Joint Venture take actions to protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that others will not imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights.\nHistorically, we have sought to register our trademarks domestically and internationally and the Joint Venture will continue to do so in the future. Obstacles may exist that may prevent the Joint Venture from obtaining a trademark for the bebe and BEBE SPORT brand names or related names. The Joint Venture may not be able to register certain trademarks, purchase the right or obtain a license to use these names or related names on commercially reasonable terms. If the Joint Venture fails to obtain trademarks of, or ownership or license of the requisite rights, it would limit the ability to expand the business under the bebe brand.\nIn some jurisdictions, despite successful registration of bebe's trademarks, third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us and or the Joint Venture. In addition, if our licensees fail to use the bebe intellectual property correctly, the reputation and value associated with the trademarks may be diluted. Furthermore, if we or the Joint Venture do not demonstrate use of our trademarks, our trademark rights may lapse over time.\nIn addition, we face the potential of receiving claims that the technology we use or license infringes on another\u2019s proprietary rights. In certain circumstances, we may be subject to having to defend ourselves from such claims and/or be subject to unanticipated license fees or the necessity to transition away from technology we are using or abandon such use altogether.\n14. Our business may be negatively impacted by any failure to comply with regulatory requirements.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC and The NASDAQ Capital Market. In addition, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, including those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, competition, privacy, consumer protection, credit cards, import/export and anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers could take actions that violate these requirements and/or our compliance policies and procedures, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. Regulatory developments regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials used by suppliers and subject us to costs associated with the relevant regulations, including for diligence pertaining to the presence of any conflict minerals used in our products, possible changes to products, processes or sources of our inputs and reporting requirements.\n15. There are litigation and other claims against us from time to time, which could distract management from our business activities and could lead to adverse consequences to our business and financial condition.\nWe are involved from time to time with litigation and other claims against us. Often these cases can raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time. Although we do not currently believe that the outcome of any current litigation or claim against us will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, we have, in the past, incurred unexpected expense in connection with litigation matters. In the future, adverse settlements, judgments or resolutions may negatively impact our business. Injunctions against us could have an adverse effect on our business by requiring us to do, or prohibiting us from engaging in, certain activities. We may in the future be the target of material litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\n16. We rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture all of our products.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to find manufacturing facilities that perform acceptably. We do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on third parties to manufacture our products. In addition, we place all of our orders for production by purchase order and do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturers. If we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our manufacturers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that third-party manufacturers (1) will not supply similar products to our competitors, (2) will not stop supplying products to us completely or (3) will supply products in a timely manner. Untimely receipt of products may result in lower than anticipated sales and markdowns which would have a negative impact on our business. Furthermore, we have received in the past, and may receive in the future, shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In such event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we may lose sales.\n17. We face fluctuating and generally increasing product costs from our manufacturing partners, which could result in margin erosion.\nFluctuations in the cost, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods, or our ability to meet customer demand. The prices for such fabrics depend largely on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton, as well as the cost of compliance with sourcing laws. The price of such raw materials has been increasing and the price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields and weather patterns. Such factors may be exacerbated by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change. Additionally, clothing manufacturers in China, where a significant percentage of our apparel products are manufactured, are experiencing increased costs due to labor shortages and the fluctuation of the Chinese Yuan in relation to the U.S. dollar, and these increased costs are often passed on to us. We are also susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of transportation. We may not be able to pass all or a portion of higher raw materials prices or labor or transportation costs on to our customers, which could adversely affect our business.\n18. If we are unable to obtain raw materials for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe place all of our orders for raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long-term contracts with any supplier. If we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers or are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, it could harm our business. Finally, certain of our third-party manufacturers store our raw materials. In the event our inventory was damaged or destroyed and we were unable to obtain replacement raw materials, our earnings and our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\n19. If we are unable to receive product or if our receipt of product is delayed due to unforeseen events, such as port closures, we may not be able to stock our stores, or may have to take unexpected markdowns to clear product that missed their seasonal window.\nWe time receipt of our products such that they are in our stores at the appropriate time to meet desired in-stock levels and the appropriate season. If we are unable to receive product due port closures, for example, we may not have sufficient stock at our stores which could impact store traffic and sales. Or if such delays cause us to receive product after the season is over, we may have to take significant unforeseen markdowns.\n20. If an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws, or is accused of violating any such laws, or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical, it could harm our business and brand image.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to find and contract with independent manufacturers which conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices. While we maintain a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites, and our manufacturers are contractually required to comply with such labor practices, we cannot assure the compliance of these manufacturers. In addition, we cannot control the public\u2019s perceptions of such manufacturers or their practices, even if they are compliant with law but are viewed in a negative light by the public. Because manufacturers act in their own interests, they may act in a manner that results in negative public perceptions of us. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may be subject to liability or negative publicity that could adversely affect our brand and our business as a result of actions taken by these manufacturers.\n21. We are subject to cyber-security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other on-line activities to connect with our customers. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our business could be adversely affected. For example, in November 2014, we detected suspicious activity on computers that operate the payment processing system for our stores, which appeared to be limited to data from payment cards swiped in the United States and its territories between November 8, 2014 and November 26, 2014. The data may have included cardholder name, account number, expiration date and verification codes, although we have no indication of fraudulent charges to date. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer future breaches of the portion of our network that handles payment card data, with further payment card and client information being stolen. These sorts of breaches might cause our customers to lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of our club bebe loyalty program, or stop shopping with us altogether. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our employees could also hurt our reputation, cause employee recruiting and retention challenges, increase our labor costs and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n22. We rely on information technology to help manage our operations and our e-commerce store, the disruption of which could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on various information systems to help manage our operations and regularly assess the cost-benefit analysis associated with making additional investments to upgrade, enhance or replace such systems. If at any time we experience any disruptions affecting our information systems we could experience a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, we operate an e-commerce store at www.bebe.com to sell our merchandise. Our on-line operations are subject to numerous risks, including unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third-party computer software providers and system failures. If at any time we experience any disruptions affecting our e-commerce store, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business. Our e-commerce operations also involve other risks that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including diversion of sales from our other stores, rapid technological change, liability for on-line content, credit card fraud and loss of sensitive data. We cannot assure you that our e-commerce store will continue to achieve sales growth or that it will not experience a decline in sales.\n23. We are responsible for maintaining the privacy of personally identifiable information of our customers.\nThrough our sale transactions, loyalty programs and other methods, we obtain personally identifiable information about our customers which is subject to federal, state and international privacy laws. These laws are constantly changing. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other adverse actions. We are highly dependent on the use of credit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our websites, and if we fail to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, we may become subject to limitations on our ability to accept credit cards. Moreover, third parties may seek to access this information through improper means such as computer hacking, malware and viruses. Any incidents involving unauthorized access or improper use of our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information could damage our reputation and brand and result in legal or regulatory action against us.\n24. Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, and maintaining investments.\nWe have entered into a joint venture with another company and may make other investments or enter into other joint ventures in the future. Transactions such as these create risks such as the disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing business, and impose certain operating covenants on us. Further, one or more parties may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a limited and lesser degree of control over joint venture decisions and actions, thereby potentially increasing financial, legal and compliance risks associated with each joint venture we enter into and could result in reduced profits, or in some cases, significant losses. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. In addition, investments in which an investee's financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, require us to depend on the investee's accounting, financial reporting and similar systems, controls and processes. Furthermore, the success of our joint venture depends on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations. The failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n1. Because Manny Mashouf beneficially owns a substantial portion of the outstanding shares, other shareholders have limited ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of July 2, 2016, Manny Mashouf, our CEO and Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned approximately 58.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, he has the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction. He also has the ability to control our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock, even if such a transaction would benefit other shareholders. In addition, he could also sell his shares at any time, in open market transactions, registered offerings or otherwise and such a sale could negatively impact our share price.\n2. Our stock price could fluctuate substantially for reasons outside of our control.\nOur common stock is quoted on The NASDAQ Capital Market, which has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect our stock price without regard to our financial performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and comparable\nsales; announcements by other apparel, accessory, music and gift item retailers; the trading volume of our stock; changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts; litigation; overall economic and political conditions, including the global economic downturn; the condition of the financial markets, including the credit crisis; and other events or factors outside of our control could cause our stock price to fluctuate substantially.\n3. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to seek to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\n4. If we sell shares of our common stock in the future, shareholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our shareholders would experience immediate dilution. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common shareholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.", "PERMNO": 86150, "SIC": 2330, "TIC": "BEBE"}
