{"cik": "1302707", "company": "Horizon Lines, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have incurred significant net losses from continuing operations in the recent past, and such losses may continue in the future, which may result in a need for increased access to capital. If our cash provided by operating and financing activities is insufficient to fund our cash requirements, we could face substantial liquidity problems.\nOur net losses from continuing operations were $94.6 million, $33.3 million, and $74.4 million for the fiscal years ending 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In the event we require capital in the future due to continued losses, such capital may not be available on satisfactory terms, or available at all.\nOur liquidity derived from our $100.0 million principal amount asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) is based on availability determined by a borrowing base. We may not be able to maintain adequate levels of eligible assets to support our required liquidity in the future.\nThe Merger and the Hawaii Sale are subject to various closing conditions, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when they may be completed.\nOn November 11, 2014, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson. On November 11, 2014, the Company also entered into the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Pasha will acquire the Company\u2019s Hawaii trade lane business, prior to closing of the Merger, for approximately $141.5 million in cash. The description of the Merger Agreement and the Purchase Agreement below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, as filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2014.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, following the Hawaii sale, if the Merger is consummated, each outstanding share of Company common stock, other than shares owned by the Company, Matson, Merger Sub and holders who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be converted into the right to receive $0.72 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and each outstanding warrant to acquire shares of Company common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of the per share merger consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such warrant, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.\nOn February 25, 2015, at the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The approval to adopt the Merger Agreement required the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding as of the close of business on January 27, 2015, the record date for the Special Meeting.\nThe Merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, among other things, completion of the Hawaii sale. The Hawaii sale is also subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger and regulatory approval. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of these conditions will be satisfied. The Company currently expects to close the Merger immediately after the completion of the Hawaii sale, assuming that all of the conditions to the completion of the Merger have been satisfied when the conditions to the completion of the Hawaii sale are satisfied.\nCompletion of the Merger and of the Hawaii sale is conditioned upon the absence of any law or order enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions, including under antitrust laws. The Hawaii sale is further conditioned upon the the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting\nperiods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d). On December 11, 2014, each of the Company and Pasha submitted HSR filings to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the FTC, and on January 12, 2015, each of the Company and Pasha received a request for additional information and documentary material, commonly known as a \u201csecond request,\u201d from the Antitrust Division, which requests have the effect of extending the waiting period applicable to the Hawaii sale under the HSR Act until 30 days after both the Company and Pasha have substantially complied with the second request. The Company is preparing its response to the second request and intends to comply with the second request as promptly as practicable. We cannot predict with certainty when we will obtain approval for the Hawaii sale, if at all. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including in specified circumstances due to the failure to obtain regulatory approval, Pasha would be responsible to pay the Company the Antitrust Termination Fee.\nIf the Merger Agreement or Purchase Agreement is terminated, our remedies will be limited.\nEven though obtaining financing is not a condition to the completion of the Merger or the Hawaii sale, the failure of Matson or Pasha to obtain sufficient financing is likely to result in the failure of the Merger or the Hawaii sale to be completed. Matson expects to fund the Merger with cash on hand and available borrowings under Matson\u2019s revolving credit facility, together with the anticipated cash proceeds from the completion of the Hawaii sale. Pasha has informed the Company that it intends to seek debt financing in order to fund the purchase price for the Hawaii sale. If the Merger or the Hawaii sale is not completed due to failure to obtain sufficient financing, our sole remedy against Matson or Pasha is to seek specific performance of the Merger Agreement or Purchase Agreement respectively Additionally, other than Pasha\u2019s obligation to pay us the Antitrust Termination Fee if the Purchase Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances due to the failure to obtain regulatory approval, specific performance is our only remedy against Matson or Pasha if the Merger or Hawaii sale does not close due to Matson\u2019s failure to perform any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement or Pasha\u2019s failure to perform any of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement.\nThe pendency of the Merger and the Hawaii Sale could materially and adversely affect our operations and the future of our business, result in a loss of employees, and/or divert management\u2019s attention from the Company\u2019s ongoing business operations.\nIn connection with the pending Merger and Hawaii Sale, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Merger or the Hawaii Sale, which could negatively impact our revenue, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger or the Hawaii Sale is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the Merger or Hawaii Sale, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. In addition, the Company\u2019s management team may have to allocate significant resources to the pending Merger and Hawaii Sale, which may divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations.\nThe Merger Agreement and the Purchase Agreement restrict the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger and the Hawaii Sale, respectively\nUnder the Merger Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger and the Hawaii Sale respectively, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger and the Hawaii Sale or termination of the Merger Agreement or the Purchase Agreement.\nFailure to complete the Merger and the Hawaii Sale could negatively impact our stock price and our future businesses and financial results.\nIf the Merger or the Hawaii Sale is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nunder the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $9.5 million (and reimburse Matson for certain fees and expenses related to the transaction);\n\u2022\nunder the Purchase Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $5.0 million (and reimburse Pasha for certain fees and expenses related to the transaction);\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger or the Hawaii Sale, whether or not the Merger or the Hawaii Sale is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock could decrease to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed or as a result of the market\u2019s perceptions that the Merger was not consummated due to an adverse change in our business; and\n\u2022\nhaving had the focus of our management directed towards the Merger and the Hawaii Sale instead of our core business and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nIn addition, if the Merger or the Hawaii Sale is not completed, we would not realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the transactions and would continue to have risks that we currently face as an independent company. We might also experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers, suppliers, employees and regulators, including as a result of the possibility that others may believe that we cannot compete in the marketplace as effectively without the Merger or the Hawaii Sale or otherwise remain uncertain about our future prospects in the absence of the transactions. We could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or the Hawaii Sale or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to attempt to force us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement or the Purchase Agreement. Our remedies if the Merger Agreement or the Purchase Agreement is terminated are limited.\nPending litigation against the Company, the other parties to the Merger Agreement and our directors could result in an injunction preventing completion of the Merger or the payment of damages in the event the Merger is completed.\nSince the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, the members of our board of directors and Matson have been named as defendants in four putative stockholder class action lawsuits. The complaints allege generally, among other things, that the that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith, loyalty and due care when they negotiated and authorized the execution of the Merger Agreement, that they breached their fiduciary duty of disclosure in connection with the Company\u2019s December 23, 2014 Proxy Statement, and that each of the Company and Matson aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duties. The relief sought includes, among other things, an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or, in the alternative, rescission of the Merger Agreement in the event the Merger is consummated, with damages of an unspecified amount.\nOn February 5, 2015, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware issued an order consolidating the four complaints into \u201cIn re Horizon Lines, Inc. Stockholders Litigation,\u201d Consolidated C.A. 10399-VCL (the \u201cConsolidated Action\u201d). On February 13, 2015, the defendants and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Action reached an agreement in principle, subject to the court\u2019s approval (the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d), providing for the settlement and dismissal, with prejudice, of the Consolidated Action. Pursuant to such Memorandum of Understanding, the Company agreed to make additional disclosures to the Company\u2019s stockholders through a supplement to the Company\u2019s Definitive Proxy Statement, and the Company and Matson agreed to amend the Merger Agreement in order to reduce the amount of the termination fee payable by the\nCompany to Matson under a Fiduciary Termination from $17.1 million to $9.5 million. On February 13, 2015, the Company, Matson and Merger Sub entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Merger Agreement, as described above. The Company and its Board of Directors believe that the claims in the Actions are entirely without merit and, in the event the settlement does not resolve them, intend to contest them vigorously.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no law or order enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any governmental authority shall be in effect enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or making the consummation of the Merger illegal. Consequently, in the event the settlement does not resolve the Consolidated Action and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all. If completion of the Merger is prevented or delayed, it could result in substantial costs to us. In addition, we could incur significant costs in connection with the lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers.\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness and future indebtedness.\nWe continue to have substantial indebtedness and a stockholders\u2019 deficiency. As of December 21, 2014, on a consolidated basis, we had $522.9 million of funded long-term debt (exclusive of capital lease obligations of $11.3 million and outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $11.4 million) compared to $502.1 million of funded long-term debt (exclusive of capital lease obligations of $12.4 million and outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $12.9 million) as of December 22, 2013. In addition, as of December 21, 2014, we had approximately $187.6 million of aggregate trade payables, accrued liabilities and other balance sheet liabilities (other than the long-term debt referred to above) and (iii) a stockholders\u2019 deficiency of $145.3 million, resulting in a negative funded debt-to-equity ratio. During 2015, we expect to pay $34.8 million of cash interest under our debt agreements.\nBecause we have substantial debt, we require significant amounts of cash to fund our debt service obligations. Our ability to generate cash to meet scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt depends on our financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to the following financial and business factors, some of which may be beyond our control:\n\u2022\noperating difficulties;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\nincreased fuel costs;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our services;\n\u2022\nmarket cyclicality;\n\u2022\ntariff rates;\n\u2022\nprices for our services;\n\u2022\nthe actions of competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments; and\n\u2022\ndelays in implementing strategic projects.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, dispose of material\nassets or operations, seek to obtain additional equity capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In particular, in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service obligations, we cannot be sure as to the timing of such dispositions or the proceeds that we would realize from those dispositions. The value realized from such dispositions will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers, and, consequently, any such disposition may not, among other things, result in sufficient cash proceeds to repay our indebtedness.\nOur substantial indebtedness and future indebtedness could significantly impair our operating and financial condition.\nWe continue to face challenges in functioning as a highly leveraged company. Our substantial indebtedness, history of continuing losses, and the substantial liquidity needs we face have and continue to have important consequences to investors and significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and contractual and commercial commitments and, if we fail to comply with these requirements, an event of default could result;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our existing indebtedness, which reduces the funds available to us for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to react to changes in our industry and make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in our business or economic conditions in general; and\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing in the future, and the terms of any future financings may limit our ability to manage our business. Difficulties in obtaining financing on favorable terms would have a negative effect on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nWe will need to seek additional capital in the future to refinance or replace existing long-term debt and to fund capital expenditures such as the installation of the exhaust gas cleaning systems on our Alaska vessels. We may also need to seek additional capital in the future to meet current or future business plans, meet working capital needs or for other reasons. Based on the significant amount of our existing indebtedness and current market conditions, the availability of financing is, and may continue to be, limited.\nFurther issuances of our common stock and the exercise of outstanding warrants could be dilutive.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the issuance or sales of a large number of shares in the market, including the issuance of shares underlying our outstanding warrants, or the perception that these issuances could occur. These issuances could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nIn connection with our 2011 comprehensive refinancing, we issued warrants to purchase 982,975 shares of our common stock. In addition, on January 11, 2012, we issued warrants to purchase up to 1,702,592 shares of\ncommon stock to complete the mandatory debt-to-equity conversion of approximately $49.7 million of the Series B Notes. After concluding the April 9, 2012 transactions, warrants equivalent to 75,989,794 shares on an as converted basis were issued and outstanding.\nAny further issuances of our common stock, including the issuance of shares pursuant to the exercise of some or all of the outstanding warrants, could further dilute existing holders of our common stock and could cause the price of our common stock to decrease and the value of each share of our common stock to decline substantially.\nWe may face new competitors or increased competition, which may have a substantial impact on our results from operations.\nThe entry of a new competitor or increased vessel capacity serving any one of our markets may have a substantial impact on our results from operations.\nOne of our existing competitors in the Hawaii market expects to introduce a new vessel during early 2015. Another Hawaii competitor plans to build two containerships for use in the Hawaii market that will feature dual fuel engines that can run on liquefied natural gas and are expected to be delivered in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.\nThese existing and any new competitors may have access to financial resources substantially greater than our own. In addition, existing non-Jones Act-qualified shipping operators whose container ships sail between ports in Asia and the U.S. west coast could add Hawaii or Alaska as additional stops on their sailing routes for non-U.S. originated or destined cargo. Shipping operators could also add Hawaii or Alaska as additional stops on their sailing routes between the continental U.S. and ports in Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America for non-U.S. originated or destined cargo.\nThe age of our vessels may make it difficult to operate profitably in the markets we serve.\nWe believe that each of the vessels we operate, in its existing state, currently has an estimated useful life of approximately 45 years from the year it was built. In addition, newer vessels are generally more efficient, use less fuel, are faster and have a lower environmental impact than older vessels. The average age of our vessels is 35 years.\nSome of our vessels will need to be replaced soon. We may not be able to replace our existing vessels with new vessels based on uncertainties related to costs, financing, timing and shipyard availability. In addition, as our fleet ages, operation and maintenance costs increase. For example, insurance rates and the costs of compliance with governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards increase as the vessels age. Moreover, the failure to make capital expenditures to alter or add new equipment to our vessels may restrict the type of activities in which these vessels may engage. We cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives.\nWe may not be able to install new engines or exhaust gas cleaning systems on our existing vessels in order to comply with changing regulations and to continue operating such vessels.\nWe have finalized specifications for exhaust gas cleaning systems on three of our vessels serving the Alaska trade lane. Installing exhaust cleaning systems on these vessels is one option to comply with regulations which became effective January 1, 2015, requiring that the allowable sulfur content inside designated emission control areas decreased to 0.1%.\nWe may not be able to execute our plan to install exhaust gas cleaning systems on these vessels if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult to obtain\nfinancing or to satisfy any contractual commitments in connection with the effort to install such exhaust cleaning systems. If we are not able to have exhaust gas cleaning systems installed or the installations are not successful, we may not have sufficient vessel capacity to operate our business as expected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or prospects.\nIn order to address the expiration of the steamship exemption in 2020 and because our 8 steamships cannot safely burn 0.1% sulfur content fuel oil, we will most likely need to make material capital expenditures to install engines or systems on these vessels to address fuel efficiency and emissions, or to replace such vessels altogether. It is not yet known whether any engine or system modifications will exist or be flexible to allow our steamship fleet to be brought into compliance with these environmental laws and regulations.\nCertain of our investors hold a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions.\nWe believe a small group of investors holds over 96% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. As a result, they possess significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions. Their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer.\nWe face the risk of breaching covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may not be able to comply with such covenants.\nOur debt agreements contain financial covenants that could cause us to suffer an event of default. Our ability to meet the covenants can be affected by various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our debt agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt agreements, all amounts outstanding can be declared immediately due and payable. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our ability to repay borrowings under our debt agreements.\nUnder agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock, and we may not meet Delaware law requirements or have sufficient cash to pay dividends in the future.\nWe are not required to pay dividends to our stockholders, and our stockholders do not have contractual or other rights to receive them. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness allow us to pay dividends only under limited circumstances, and pursuant to those agreements, we currently are not permitted to pay such dividends.\nIn addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may not authorize a dividend unless it is paid out of our surplus (calculated in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation law), or, if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and the preceding fiscal year.\nOur ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour obligations under agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe state of our business, the environment in which we operate, and the various risks we face, including financing risks and other risks summarized in this report;\n\u2022\nthe results of our operations, financial condition, liquidity needs and capital resources;\n\u2022\nour expected cash needs, including for interest and any future principal payments on indebtedness, capital expenditures and payment of fines and settlements related to antitrust and qui tam matters; and\n\u2022\npotential sources of liquidity, including borrowing under our revolving credit facility or possible asset sales.\nWe depend on the federal government for a portion of our business, and we could be adversely affected by suspension or debarment by the federal government.\nSome of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. government, and as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to federal regulations regarding the performance of our government contracts. In addition, we are required to certify our compliance with numerous federal laws, including environmental laws. Failure to comply with relevant federal laws may result in suspension or debarment.\nVolatility in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFuel is a significant operating expense for our shipping operations. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. As a result, variability in the price of fuel may adversely affect profitability. There can be no assurance that our customers will agree to bear such fuel price increases via fuel surcharges without a reduction in their volumes of business with us, nor any assurance that our future fuel hedging efforts, if any, will be successful.\nRepeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels were to enter any of our Jones Act markets, our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, our advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign and domestic interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. In the past, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S.-flag vessels under the Jones Act. We believe that interest groups may continue efforts to modify or repeal the Jones Act currently benefiting U.S.-flag vessels. If these efforts are successful, it could result in increased competition, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nDue to our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposure under those plans that extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees.\nWe contribute to thirteen multi-employer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from any plan which is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which we cannot independently validate, we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination would be material to our financial position and results of operations. In the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan which is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then we, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Even if we do not take any actions that would subject us to withdrawal liabilities, another contributing employer could take such actions.\nDue to the planned exit of our Puerto Rico operations, we recorded a $26.8 million liability, on a present value basis, at December 21, 2014, for the estimated cost of early withdrawal from the ILA - PRSSA Welfare Fund. Actual costs of withdrawal from this plan may differ materially from our estimate.\nIn addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to Section 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to herein as the Code, will impose an excise tax of five percent (5%) on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency. Under Section 413(c)(5) of the Code, the liability of each contributing employer, including us, will be determined in part by each employer\u2019s respective delinquency in meeting the required employer contributions under the plan. The Code also requires contributing employers to make additional contributions in order to reduce the deficiency to zero, which may, along with the payment of the excise tax, have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nCompliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations.\nThe shipping industry in general and our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, state and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following: laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources. For example, our vessels, as U.S.-flagged vessels, generally must be maintained \u201cin class\u201d and are subject to periodic inspections by ABS or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the Coast Guard. Federal environmental laws and certain state laws require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up. In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for ship modifications and changes in operating procedures. Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.\nOur vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed. Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment to, or change operating procedures for, our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs. If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements MARPOL, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, record keeping and reporting requirements such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business.\nRestrictions on foreign ownership of our vessels could limit our ability to sell off any portion of our business or result in the forfeiture of our vessels.\nThe Jones Act restricts the foreign ownership interests in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels which we operate in our Jones Act markets. If the Merger and/or the Hawaii sale are not consummated and if we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that owns any of these vessels, we would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain\nthe amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market. Furthermore, at any point Horizon Lines, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and principal operating subsidiary, ceases to be controlled and 75% owned by U.S. citizens, we would become ineligible to operate in our current Jones Act markets and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of our vessels.\nCatastrophic losses and other liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and such losses and liability may be beyond insurance coverage.\nThe operation of any oceangoing vessel carries with it an inherent risk of catastrophic maritime disaster, mechanical failure, collision, and loss of or damage to cargo. Also, in the course of the operation of our vessels, marine disasters, such as oil spills and other environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, and business interruption due to political or other developments, as well as maritime disasters not involving us, labor disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result in loss of revenue, liabilities or increased costs, personal injury, loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. Damage arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nAlthough we maintain insurance, including retentions and deductibles, at levels that we believe are consistent with industry norms against the risks described above, including loss of life, there can be no assurance that this insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages suffered by us from the occurrence of all of the risks described above or the loss of income resulting from one or more of our vessels being removed from operation. We also cannot be assured that a claim will be paid or that we will be able to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates in the future. Further, if we are negligent or otherwise responsible in connection with any such event, our insurance may not cover our claim.\nIn the event that any of the claims arising from any of the foregoing possible events were assessed against us, all of our assets could be subject to attachment and other judicial process.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our shipping and logistics services, especially HITS, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nOur provision of our shipping and logistics services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, especially our Horizon Information Technology System (\u201cHITS\u201d). We have experienced brief system failures in the past and may experience brief or substantial failures in the future. Any failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service reducing our revenue and profits and damaging our brand. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, or other unanticipated problems at our facilities at which we maintain and operate our systems could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our shipping and integrated logistics services, especially HITS.\nOur vessels could be arrested by maritime claimants, which could result in significant loss of earnings and cash flow.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo, lenders and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a claimant may enforce its lien by either arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. Moreover, crew members may place liens for unpaid wages that can include significant statutory penalty wages if the unpaid wages remain overdue (e.g., double wages for every day during which the unpaid wages remain overdue). The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow for the period during which the arrest or attachment is continuing.\nWe are susceptible to severe weather and natural disasters and global climate change may make adverse weather conditions more severe or frequent.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons and earthquakes. Such events will interfere with our ability to provide the on-time scheduled service our customers demand resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with our terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to our vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment and loss of life or physical injury to our employees. In the past, earthquakes in Anchorage have damaged our terminal facilities resulting in delay in terminal operations and increased expenses. Any such damage will not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe risk of adverse weather conditions is enhanced by the potential for global climate change which some scientists believe may increase severe weather patterns. The EPA has found in its recent greenhouse gas endangerment finding that global climate change would result in more severe and possibly more frequent adverse weather conditions. If this is the case, the above mentioned risks would be expected to increase in years ahead. For example, increased or more powerful weather events could result in damage to our shipping terminals and vessels or disrupt port operations.\nWe may face unexpected substantial dry-docking costs for our vessels.\nOur vessels are dry-docked periodically to comply with regulatory requirements and to effect maintenance and repairs, if necessary. The cost of such repairs at each dry-docking are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. Our established processes have enabled us to make on average four dry-dockings per year over the last five years with a minimal impact on schedule. There are some years when we have more than the average of four dry-dockings annually. In addition, our vessels may have to be dry-docked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. Our insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large unpredictable repair and dry-docking expenses could significantly decrease our profits.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of common stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens. This may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to disgorge profits, sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights.\nUnder applicable U.S. maritime laws, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of our capital stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of such laws. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the common stock.\nUnder the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, any transfer, or attempted transfer, of any shares of our capital stock will be void if the effect of such transfer, or attempted transfer, would be to cause one or more non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate to own (of record or beneficially) shares of any class or series of our capital stock in excess of 19.9% of the outstanding shares of such class or series. To the extent such restrictions voiding transfers are effective, the liquidity or market value of the shares of common stock may be adversely impacted.\nIn the event such restrictions voiding transfers would be ineffective for any reason, our certificate of incorporation provides that if any transfer would otherwise result in the number of shares of any class or series of our capital stock owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens being in excess of 19.9% of the outstanding shares of such class or series, such transfer will cause such excess shares to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries that are U.S. citizens. The proposed transferee will have no rights in the shares transferred to the trust, and the trustee, who is a U.S. citizen chosen by us and unaffiliated with us or the proposed transferee, will have all voting, dividend and distribution\nrights associated with the shares held in the trust. The trustee will sell such excess shares to a U.S. citizen within 20 days of receiving notice from us and distribute to the proposed transferee the lesser of the price that the proposed transferee paid for such shares and the amount received from the sale, and any gain from the sale will be paid to the charitable beneficiary of the trust.\nThese trust transfer provisions also apply to situations where ownership of a class or series of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens in excess of 19.9% would be exceeded by a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner thereof from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen, in which case such person will receive the lesser of the market price of the shares on the date of such status change and the amount received from the sale. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation, if the sale or other disposition of shares of common stock would result in non-U.S. citizens owning (of record or beneficially) in excess of 19.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock, the excess shares shall be automatically transferred to a trust for disposal by a trustee in accordance with the trust transfer provisions described above. As part of the foregoing trust transfer provisions, the trustee will be deemed to have offered the excess shares in the trust to us at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date we accept the offer and (ii) the price per share in the purported transfer or original issuance of shares, as described in the preceding paragraph, or the market price per share on the date of the status change, that resulted in the transfer to the trust.\nAs a result of the above trust transfer provisions, a proposed transferee that is a non-U.S. citizen or a record or beneficial owner whose citizenship status change results in excess shares may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss.\nTo the extent that the above trust transfer provisions would be ineffective for any reason, our certificate of incorporation provides that, if the percentage of the shares of any class or series of our capital stock owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens is known to us to be in excess of 19.9% for such class or series, we, in our sole discretion, shall be entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by our board of directors in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in our certificate of incorporation), by non-U.S. citizens, or owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens as a result of a change in citizenship status, in excess of such maximum permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in our certificate of incorporation. Such excess shares shall not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by us. As a result of these provisions, a stockholder who is a non-U.S. citizen may be required to sell its shares of common stock at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment in such shares. Further, we may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened.\nSo that we may ensure our compliance with the applicable maritime laws, our certificate of incorporation permits us to require that any record or beneficial owner of any shares of our capital stock provide us from time to time with certain documentation concerning such owner\u2019s citizenship and comply with certain requirements. These provisions include a requirement that every person acquiring, directly or indirectly, five percent (5%) or more of the shares of any class or series of our capital stock must provide us with specified citizenship documentation. In the event that a person does not submit such requested or required documentation to us, our certificate of incorporation provides us with certain remedies, including the suspension of the voting rights of such person\u2019s shares of our capital stock and the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, a record or beneficial owner of the shares of our common stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing foreign ownership restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governance documents and applicable U.S. maritime laws place restrictions on transfers and acquisitions or accumulation of our equity by third parties, and the failure of the protections afforded by such provisions may have a material detrimental impact on our Jones Act operations and/or impair our future ability to use a substantial amount of our existing net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions voiding transfers of shares of any class or series of our capital stock that would result in non-U.S. citizens, in the aggregate, owning in excess of 19.9% of the shares of such class or series. In the event that this transfer restriction would be ineffective, our certificate of incorporation provides for the automatic transfer of such excess shares to a trust specified therein. These trust provisions also apply to excess shares that would result from a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen. In the event that these trust transfer provisions would also be ineffective, our certificate of incorporation permits us to redeem such excess shares. The per-share redemption price may be paid, as determined by our Board of Directors, by cash, redemption notes, or warrants. However, we may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because our operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25.0% of such class or series, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25.0% of any such class or series, or fail to exercise our redemption right because we are unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, we will likely be unable to comply with applicable maritime laws. If all of the citizenship-related safeguards in our certificate of incorporation fail at a time when ownership of shares of any class or series of our stock is in excess of 25.0% of such class or series, we will likely be required to suspend our Jones Act operations. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on the results of our operations.\nIn addition to our corporate governance documents, on August 27, 2012, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) designed to protect our significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d). The Rights Plan will expire on August 27, 2015, or earlier upon the date that: (1) our Board of Directors determines that the plan is no longer needed to preserve the deferred tax assets or is no longer in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders, (2) our Board of Directors determines, at the beginning of a specified period, that no tax benefits may be carried forward, or (3) the rights are redeemed or exchanged by our Board of Directors pursuant to the Rights Plan. As of December 21, 2014, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $239.7 million. Under applicable tax rules, we may \u201ccarry forward\u201d these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. Therefore, we believe that these NOLs could be a substantial asset. However, if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code, our ability to use the NOLs could be substantially limited, which could significantly increase our future income tax liability.\nAlthough the Rights Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, we cannot assure that it would prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. In particular, it would not protect against ownership changes resulting from sales by certain greater than five percent (5%) stockholders that may trigger limitations on our use of NOLs under Section 382 of the Code. Further, because the Rights Plan may restrict a stockholder\u2019s ability to acquire our stock, the liquidity and market value of our stock might be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to statutory and regulatory directives in the United States addressing homeland security concerns that may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.\nVarious government agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), including the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard (\u201cCoast Guard\u201d), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d), have adopted, and may adopt in the future, rules, policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws, rules, policies or regulations, compliance with which could increase our costs or result in loss of revenue.\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s maritime security regulations, issued pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (\u201cMTSA\u201d), require us to operate our vessels and facilities pursuant to both the maritime security regulations and approved security plans. Our vessels and facilities are subject to periodic security compliance verification examinations by the Coast Guard. A failure to operate in accordance with the maritime security regulations or the approved security plans may result in the imposition of a fine or control and compliance measures, including the suspension or revocation of the security plan, thereby making the vessel or facility ineligible to operate. We are also required to audit these security plans on an annual basis and, if necessary, submit amendments to the Coast Guard for its review and approval. Failure to timely submit the necessary amendments may lead to the imposition of the fines and control and compliance measures described above. Failure to meet the requirements of the maritime security regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDHS may adopt additional security-related regulations, including new requirements for screening cargo and our reimbursement to the agency for the cost of security services. Any such new security-related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process cargo or could increase our operating costs. In particular, our customers typically need quick shipment of their cargos and rely on our on-time shipping capabilities. If any new regulations disrupt or impede the timing of our shipments, we may fail to meet the needs of our customers, or may incur additional expenses to do so.\nIncreased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nDomestic container shipping is subject to various security, inspection, and related procedures, referred to herein as inspection procedures. Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of containers or their contents, delays in the loading, offloading, transshipment or delivery of containers and the levying of fines or other penalties.\nWe understand that, currently, only a small proportion of all containers delivered to the United States are physically inspected by U.S., state or local authorities prior to delivery to their destinations. The U.S. government, foreign governments, international organizations, and industry associations have been considering ways to improve and expand inspection procedures. There are numerous proposals to enhance the existing inspection procedures, which if implemented would likely affect shipping and integrated logistics companies such as us. Such changes could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us, including additional responsibility for physically inspecting and recording the contents of containers we are shipping. In addition, changes to inspection procedures could impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo by container uneconomical or impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNo assurance can be given that our insurance costs will not escalate.\nOur protection and indemnity insurance (\u201cP&I\u201d) is provided by a mutual P&I club which is a member of the International Group of P&I clubs. As a mutual club, it relies on member premiums, investment reserves and income, and reinsurance to manage liability risks on behalf of its members.\nOur coverage under the Longshore Act for U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers compensation is provided by Signal Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd. Signal Mutual is a non-profit organization whose members pool risks of a similar nature to achieve long-term and stable insurance protection at cost. Signal Mutual is now the largest provider of Longshore benefits in the country. This program provides for first-dollar coverage without a deductible.\nIncreased investment losses, underwriting losses, or reinsurance costs could cause international marine insurance clubs to increase the cost of premiums, resulting not only in higher premium costs, but also higher levels of deductibles and self-insurance retentions.\nEnvironmental and Other Regulation\nOur marine operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations implemented principally by the Coast Guard, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), as well as related state regulatory agencies. These requirements generally govern the safe operations of our ships and pollution prevention in U.S. internal waters, the territorial sea, and the 200-mile exclusive economic zone of the United States.\nThe operation of our vessels is also subject to regulation under various international conventions adopted by the IMO that are implemented by the laws of domestic and foreign jurisdiction, and enforced by the Coast Guard and by port state authorities in our non-U.S. ports of call. In addition, our vessels are required to meet construction, maintenance and repair standards established by ABS, Det Norske Veritas (\u201cDNV\u201d), International Maritime Organization (\u201cIMO\u201d) and/or the Coast Guard, as well as to meet operational, environmental, security, and safety standards and regulations presently established by the Coast Guard, CBP, DOT, EPA and IMO. The Coast Guard also licenses our seagoing officers and certifies our seamen.\nOur marine operations are further subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d), MARAD, the Federal Maritime Commission, the EPA, CBP, and the Coast Guard. These regulatory authorities have broad powers over operational safety, publication of tariff rates, service contracts, transfer or sale of our vessels, certain mergers, contraband, pollution prevention, financial reporting, and homeland, port, facility and vessel security.\nOur common and contract motor carrier operations are regulated by the STB, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and various state agencies. Our drivers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including certain regulations for drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. The ship\u2019s officers and unlicensed crew members employed aboard our vessels must also comply with numerous safety, fitness and training regulations promulgated by the Coast Guard, the DOT, and the IMO, including certain regulations for drug testing and work and rest hours.\nThe United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\u201cOPA\u201d) was enacted in 1990 and established a comprehensive regulatory and liability regime designed to increase pollution prevention, ensure better spill response capability, increase liability for oil spills, and facilitate prompt compensation for cleanup and damages. OPA is applicable to owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the navigable waters of the United States (generally three nautical miles from the coastline) and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone of the United States. Under OPA, vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers are \u201cresponsible parties\u201d and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless it is subsequently determined by the Coast Guard or a court of competent jurisdiction that the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for removal costs and damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels up to their limits of liability, unless the limits are broken as described below. \u201cDamages\u201d are defined broadly under OPA to include:\n\u2022\nnatural resources damages and the costs of assessment thereof;\n\u2022\ndamages for injury to, or economic losses resulting from the destruction of, real or personal property;\n\u2022\nthe net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits by the United States government, and any state or political subdivision thereof;\n\u2022\nlost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage;\n\u2022\nthe net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other health hazards caused by a discharge of oil or taking additional safety precautions; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of subsistence use of natural resources.\nEffective July 31, 2009, the OPA regulations were amended to increase the liability limits for responsible parties for non-tank vessels to $1,000 per gross ton or $854,400, whichever is greater. These limits of liability do not apply: (1) if an incident was proximately caused by violation of applicable federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by a responsible party\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (2) if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident, fails to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance requested by a responsible official in connection with oil removal activities, or without sufficient cause fails to comply with an order issued under OPA.\nIn 1980, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) was adopted and is applicable to the discharge of hazardous substances (other than oil) whether on land or at sea. CERCLA also imposes liability similar to OPA and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited.\nOPA requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under OPA. Effective July 1, 2009, the Coast Guard regulations requiring evidence of financial responsibility were amended to conform the OPA financial responsibility requirements to the July 2009 increases in liability limits. Current Coast Guard regulations require evidence of financial responsibility for oil pollution in the amount of $1,000 per gross ton or $854,400, whichever is greater, for non-tank vessels, plus the CERCLA liability limit of $300 per gross ton for hazardous substance spills. As a result of the Delaware River Protection Act, which was enacted by Congress in 2006, the OPA limits of liability must be adjusted not less than every three years to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index.The Coast Guard, however, did not raise these limits in 2012. The Coast Guard issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making on August 19, 2014 to increase the limits of liability for vessels and onshore facilities to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index, but it is unclear when the Coast Guard will adopt a final rule raising these liability limits.\nUnder the Coast Guard regulations, vessel owners and operators may evidence their financial responsibility through an insurance guaranty, surety bond, self-insurance, financial guaranty or other evidence of financial responsibility acceptable to the Coast Guard. Under OPA, an owner or operator of a fleet of vessels may demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility in an amount sufficient to cover the vessels in the fleet having the greatest maximum liability under OPA.\nThe Coast Guard\u2019s regulations concerning Certificates of Financial Responsibility provide, in accordance with OPA, that claimants may bring suit directly against an insurer or guarantor that furnishes Certificates of Financial Responsibility. In the event that such insurer or guarantor is sued directly, it is prohibited from asserting any contractual defense that it may have had against the responsible party and is limited to asserting those defenses available to the responsible party and the defense that the incident was caused by the willful misconduct of the responsible party. OPA allows individual states to impose their own liability regimes that are consistent but more stringent than OPA, with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills, as well as requirements for response and contingency planning and requirements for financial responsibility. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the states where our vessels call.\nWe maintain Certificates of Financial Responsibility as required by the Coast Guard and various states for our vessels.\nThe Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships and MARPOL requirements for oil pollution prevention\nMARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental causes. It has been updated by amendments through the years and is implemented in the United States by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. MARPOL has six specific annexes; and Annex I governs oil pollution, Annex V governs garbage pollution, and Annex VI governs air pollution.\nSince the 1990s, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) has been aggressively enforcing U.S. criminal laws against vessel owners, operators, managers, crewmembers, shoreside personnel, and corporate officers for actions related to violations of Annex I and Annex V, in particular. Prosecutions generally involve violations related to pollution prevention devices, such as the oily water separator, and include falsifying the Oil Record Book and the Garbage Record Book, obstruction of justice, false statements and conspiracy. The DOJ has imposed significant criminal penalties in vessel pollution cases and the vast majority of such cases did not actually involve pollution in the United States, but rather efforts to conceal or cover up pollution that occurred in international waters. In certain cases, responsible shipboard officers and shoreside officials have been sentenced to prison. In addition, the DOJ has required defendants to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan (\u201cECP\u201d) as part of our February 2015 negotiated resolution.\nIn the first quarter of 2012, we entered into a plea agreement with the government, and agreed to plead guilty to two false statements for maintaining an inaccurate Oil Record Book. This related to one of our containerships in the U.S. west coast-Hawaii service. As part of this plea agreement, the Company was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. As part of our probation obligation, we have developed, adopted, and implemented an enhanced ECP. Horizon Lines\u2019 probationary period ended in February 2015.\nUnder MARPOL Annex V, which governs the discharge of garbage from ships, the special area for the Wider Caribbean region including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea went into effect on May 1, 2011. Under MARPOL, these special areas require the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution and are provided with a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.\nIn addition, new regulations addressing garbage management went into effect on January 1, 2013. The new regulations impose stricter garbage management procedures and documentation requirements for all vessels and fixed and floating platforms by imposing a general prohibition on the discharge of all garbage unless the discharge is expressly provided for under the regulations. The new regulations allow the limited discharge of only four categories: food waste, cargo residues and certain operational wastes not harmful to the marine environment, and carcasses of animals carried as cargo. These regulations greatly reduce the amount of garbage that vessels will be able to dispose of at sea and will increase our costs of disposing garbage remaining on board vessels at their port calls. The Coast Guard published an interim rule on February 28, 2013 to implement these new requirements in the United States effective April 1, 2013.\nThe United States Clean Water Act\nEnacted in 1972, the United States Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) prohibits the discharge of \u201cpollutants,\u201d which includes oil or hazardous substances, into navigable waters of the United States and imposes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA discussed above.\nThe CWA established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States from point sources, such as vessels operating in the navigable waters. Pursuant to the NPDES program, the EPA issued a Vessel General Permit (\u201c2008 VGP\u201d), which was in effect from February 6, 2009 to December 19, 2013. The 2008 VGP was replaced by Phase II VGP Regime (\u201c2013 VGP\u201d) which became effective on December 19, 2013, covering the same 26 types of discharges. The 2013 VGP applies to U.S. and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length, and it therefore applies to our vessels.\nThe 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to \u201cbest management practices\u201d to manage the covered discharges, including ballast water, which occur normally in the operation of a vessel. In addition, the 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to implement various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. The purpose of these limitations is to reduce the number of living organisms discharged via ballast water into\nwaters regulated by the 2013 VGP. The 2013 VGP also contains requirements for oil-to-sea interfaces, which seeks to improve environmental protection of U.S. waters, by requiring all vessels to use an Environmentally Acceptable Lubricant (EAL) in all oil-to-sea interfaces, unless not technically feasible.\nWe filed a Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2008 VGP for each of our ships and filed another Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2013 VGP, and we have implemented its requirements. Under the 2013 VGP, there is an annual reporting requirement. The 2013 VGP has resulted in increased requirements and may lead to increased enforcement by the EPA and the Coast Guard that could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s operating costs.\nOn February 11, 2011, the EPA and the Coast Guard entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) outlining the steps the agencies will take to better coordinate efforts to implement and enforce the Vessel General Permit. Under the MOU, the Coast Guard will identify and report to the EPA deficiencies detected as a result of its normal boarding protocols for U.S.-flag and foreign-flag vessels. However, the EPA retains responsibility and enforcement authority to address violations. Failure to comply with the 2013 VGP may result in civil or criminal penalties.\nSection 401(d) of the CWA permits individual states to attach additional limitations and requirements to federal permits, including the 2013 VGP, that are necessary to assure that the permit will comply with any applicable CWA-based effluent limitations and other limitations, standards of performance, prohibitions, effluent standards, or pretreatment standards, and with any other appropriate requirements of that state. Pursuant to this authority, several states have specified significant, additional requirements that became a condition of the 2013 VGP. As a result, in addition to the 2013 VGP requirements, a permit may not be issued until the owners and operators of the vessel have met state specific state conditions in accordance with Section 401 of the CWA, if applicable.\nThe National Invasive Species Act\nThe United States National Invasive Species Act (\u201cNISA\u201d) was enacted in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into United States waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports. The Coast Guard adopted regulations under NISA in July 2004 that imposed mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering United States waters. These requirements can be met by performing mid-ocean ballast exchange, by retaining ballast water on board the vessel, or by using environmentally sound ballast water treatment methods approved by the Coast Guard. Mid-ocean ballast exchange is the primary method for compliance with the Coast Guard regulations. Vessels that are unable to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange due to voyage or safety concerns may discharge minimum amounts of ballast water in U.S. waters, provided that they comply with recordkeeping requirements and document the reasons they could not follow the required ballast water management requirements.\nIn March 2012, the Coast Guard amended its regulations on ballast water management by establishing standards for the allowable concentration of living organisms in a vessel\u2019s ballast water discharged in United States waters. The final rule sets limits to match those set internationally by IMO in the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (the \u201cBallast Water Convention\u201d). The Coast Guard deferred the phase-two discharge standard, which would have been more stringent and cannot be met using existing treatment technology. However, according to the final rule, the Coast Guard intends to continue to assess the practicality of implementing a more stringent phase-two discharge standard after completing additional research and analysis. The Coast Guard requirements will be phased in over a several-year period depending on a vessel\u2019s ballast water capacity and dry-docking schedule.\nIn most cases vessels will be required to install and operate a ballast water management system (\u201cBWMS\u201d) that has been type-approved by the Coast Guard. A vessel\u2019s compliance date varies based upon the date of construction and ballast water capacity. Our existing vessels with a ballast water capacity less than 1500 cubic meters or greater than 5000 cubic meters must comply by their first scheduled dry-docking after January 1, 2016.\nIf a vessel intends to install a BWMS prior to the applicable compliance date and the Coast Guard has not yet type-approved systems appropriate for the vessel\u2019s class or type, the vessel may install an Alternate Management System (\u201cAMS\u201d) that has been approved by a foreign-flag administration pursuant to the IMO I Ballast Water Convention if the Coast Guard determines that it is at least as effective as ballast water exchanges. If an AMS is installed prior to the applicable compliance date, it may be used until five years after the compliance date, which is intended to provide sufficient time for the manufacturer to obtain Coast Guard approval. At present, however, no Coast Guard type-approved BWMS is available.\nAll of our vessels will be required to have an approved system on board by their first scheduled dry-docking survey after January 1, 2016. Systems are available that will meet the IMO standards, however, US Coast Guard has been slow to establish criteria and approve Ballast Water Treatment Systems. We are carefully monitoring developments on ballast water treatment systems and may apply for a waiver, or install an AMS or USCG approved ballast treatment system in vessel dry dockings which occur after January 1, 2016.\nIn addition to the federal standards, states have enacted legislation or regulations to address invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management, and permitting requirements, which in many cases have also become part of the state\u2019s 2013 VGP certification. For instance, California requires vessels to comply with its own ballast water discharge and hull fouling requirements. On October 1, 2013, the California legislature delayed implementation of California\u2019s ballast water discharge performance standards, effective January 1, 2014, for a two-year period. Numerous other states have also added more stringent requirements to their certification of the 2013 VGP. State requirements could increase our costs of operating in those state waters.\nThe United States Clean Air Act and Air Emission Standards under MARPOL\nIn 1970, the United States Clean Air Act (as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990, the \u201cCAA\u201d) was enacted and required the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (\u201cSIPs\u201d), which are designed to attain national health-based air quality standards throughout the United States, including major metropolitan and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The EPA and some states have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from propulsion and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels. For example, the California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) has published regulations requiring oceangoing vessels visiting California ports to reduce air pollution through the use of marine distillate fuels once they sail within 24 nautical miles of the California coastline effective July 1, 2009. CARB began enforcing these requirements on December 1, 2011. CARB\u2019s more stringent fuel oil requirements for marine gas oil and marine diesel oil went into effect on January 1, 2014, requiring oceangoing vessels to use fuel at or below 0.1% sulfur.\nThe state of California also began on January 1, 2010, implementing regulations on a phased in basis that require vessels to either shut down their auxiliary engines while in port in California and use electrical power supplied at the dock or implement alternative means to significantly reduce emissions from the vessel\u2019s electric power generating equipment while it is in port. Generally, a vessel will run its auxiliary engines while in port in order to power lighting, ventilation, pumps, communication and other onboard equipment. The emissions from running auxiliary engines while in port may contribute to particulate matter in the ambient air. The purpose of the regulations is to reduce the emissions from a vessel while it is in port. The cost of reducing vessel emissions while in port may be substantial if we determine that we cannot use or the ports will not permit us to use electrical power supplied at the dock. Alternatively, the ports may pass the cost of supplying electrical power at the port to us, and we may incur additional costs in connection with modifying our vessels to use electrical power supplied at the dock. These requirements went into effect on January 1, 2014. Currently, we only operate steamships in California, and these vessels are exempt from this regulation until January 1, 2020.\nAnnex VI of MARPOL, which addresses air emissions from vessels, came into force in the United States on January 8, 2009 and requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel\nengines on vessels. By July 1, 2010, amendments to MARPOL required all diesel engines on vessels built between 1990 and 2000 to meet a Nitrous Oxide (\u201cNOx\u201d) standard of 17.0g-NOx/kW-hr. On January 1, 2011 the NOx standard was lowered to 14.4 g-NOx/kW-hr, and on January 1, 2016 it will be further lowered to 3.4 g-NOx/kW-hr, for vessels operating in a designated Emission Control Area (\u201cECA\u201d).\nIn addition, the current global sulfur cap of 4.5% sulfur was reduced to 3.5% effective January 1, 2012 and will be further reduced to as low as 0.5% sulfur in 2020. The recommendations made in connection with a MARPOL fuel availability study scheduled for 2018 at IMO may cause this date to slip to 2025. Maximum sulfur emissions permitted in designated ECA\u2019s around the world were reduced to 0.1% on January 1, 2015. These sulfur limitations will be applied to all subsequently approved ECA\u2019s.\nWith respect to North America, the EPA received approval of the IMO, in coordination with Environment Canada, to designate all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of Hawaii and the U.S. and Canadian coasts as ECAs. The North American ECA went into force on August 1, 2012, limiting the sulfur content in fuel that is burned as described above. Beginning in 2016, NOx after-treatment requirements become applicable in this ECA as well. Furthermore, on July 15, 2011, the IMO officially adopted amendments to MARPOL to designate certain waters around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as the United States- Caribbean ECA, where stringent international emission standards will also apply to ships. For this area, the effective date of the first-phase fuel sulfur standard was January 2014, and the second phase begins in 2015. Stringent NOx engine standards begin in 2016.\nWith the adoption of the North American ECA, ships operating within 200 miles of the U.S. coast are required to burn 0.1% sulfur content fuel oil as of January 1, 2015. The EPA has received approval at IMO to exempt and has exempted our 8 steamships from the 0.1% sulfur content fuel oil requirement until 2020. We received a permit providing a conditional waiver from the North American Emissions Control Area fuel sulfur content requirements of MARPOL Annex VI regulation 14.4 for our three D-7 vessels utilized in our Alaska tradelane to allow for the installation and use of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (\u201cEGCS\u201d) on each of our three (3) D-7class vessels which operate in the Alaska trade. The permit was issued by the Coast Guard and the (EPA and became effective in 2015. The permit will allow these vessels to use low-sulfur heavy fuel oil in their main engines while operating between Washington state and Alaska, subject to compliance with other terms and restrictions of the permit. The Company is committed to operating its vessels and terminals in accordance with all environmental regulations. We entered into a supply agreement for the design and procurement of the PureSox 2.0 EGCS for the three D-7 class vessels which operate in the Alaska trade. This EGCS is a multiple inlet hybrid system which is intended to clean the exhaust gas from the main engine as well as the main generators.\nThe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\nOur operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) or comparable international, state or local requirements. From time to time we arrange for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. With respect to our marine operations, the EPA has a longstanding policy that RCRA only applies after wastes are \u201cpurposely removed\u201d from the vessel. As a general matter, with certain exceptions, vessel owners and operators are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, obtain a generator identification number, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to disposal facilities. The degree of RCRA regulation will depend on the amount of hazardous waste a generator generates in any given month. Moreover, vessel owners and operators may be subject to more stringent state hazardous waste requirements in those states where they land hazardous wastes. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties that we contract with, we may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.\nEndangered Species Regulation\nThe Endangered Species Act, federal conservation regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection of endangered and threatened species may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require us to change the routes of our vessels during particular periods. For example, in an effort to prevent the collision of vessels with the North Atlantic right whale, federal regulations restrict the speed of vessels to ten knots or less in certain areas along the Atlantic Coast of the United States during certain times of the year. The reduced speed and special routing along the Atlantic Coast results in the use of additional fuel, which affects our results of operations.\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation\nIn February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the \u201cKyoto Protocol\u201d) entered into force. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, countries that are parties to the Convention are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases, which are suspected of contributing to global warming. On January 1, 2009, the EPA began to require large emitters of greenhouse gases to collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an \u201cendangerment finding\u201d regarding greenhouse gases under the CAA.\nAny future adoption of climate control treaties, legislation or other regulatory measures by the United Nations, IMO, EU, United States or other countries where the Company operates that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in material adverse financial and operational impacts on our business (including potential capital expenditures to reduce such emissions) that the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time.\nVessel Security Regulations\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security within the United States and internationally. On November 25, 2002, MTSA was signed into law. To implement certain portions of MTSA, in July 2003, the Coast Guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, the IMO adopted amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (\u201cSOLAS\u201d), known as the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the \u201cISPS Code\u201d), creating a new chapter dealing specifically with maritime security. The new chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities. Among the various requirements under MTSA and/or the ISPS Code are:\n\u2022\non-board installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications;\n\u2022\non-board installation of ship security alert systems;\n\u2022\nthe development of vessel and facility security plans;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential program; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with flag state security certification requirements.\nThe Coast Guard regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, generally deem foreign-flag vessels to be in compliance with MTSA\u2019s vessel security measures provided such vessels have on board a valid International Ship Security Certificate that attests to the vessel\u2019s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. U.S.-flag vessels, however, must comply with all of the security measures required by MTSA, as well as SOLAS and the ISPS Code, if engaged in international trade. We believe that we have implemented the various security measures required by MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code.", "PERMNO": 90889, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "HRZL"}
