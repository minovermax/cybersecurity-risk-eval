You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe derive most of our revenues from Panorama, and if our efforts to further increase the use and adoption of Panorama or to develop new products in the future do not succeed, our business will be harmed.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 73%, 73% and 56%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales of Panorama. Although we derive some revenues from our other products, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sales of Panorama, at least in the near term. Continued and additional market acceptance of Panorama and our ability, through our direct sales efforts and through laboratory partners and licensees, to attract new customers are key elements to our future success. The market demand for NIPTs has grown in recent periods and is evolving, but this market trend may not continue or, even if it does continue to grow, physicians may not recommend and order Panorama, and our laboratory partners and licensees may not actively or effectively market Panorama.\nOur ability to increase sales and establish significant levels of adoption and reimbursement for Panorama is uncertain, and we may never be able to achieve profitability for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe NIPT market may not grow as we expect, and NIPTs may not gain acceptance for use in the average-risk pregnancy population or for screening for microdeletions, which would limit the market for Panorama;\n\u00b7\nlaboratories, clinics, clinicians, physicians, payers and patients may not adopt use of Panorama on a broad basis, and may not be willing to pay the price premium over other NIPTs that we have, to date, been able to achieve, if we are unable to demonstrate to these constituencies that Panorama is superior to competing NIPTs;\n\u00b7\nthird-party payers, such as commercial insurance companies and government insurance programs, may decide not to reimburse for Panorama, may not reimburse for uses of Panorama for the average-risk pregnancy population or for the screening of microdeletions, or may set the amounts of such reimbursements at prices that do not allow us to cover our expenses; in fact, most third-party payers currently have negative coverage determinations for average-risk patient populations and some third-party payers do not reimburse for microdeletions screening;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials and any additional clinical and economic utility data that we may develop, present and publish or that comes from the commercial use of Panorama may be inconsistent with prior data, raise questions about the performance of Panorama, or may fail to convince laboratories, clinics, clinicians, physicians, payers or patients of the value of Panorama;\n\u00b7\nwe and our laboratory partners and licensees may not be able to maintain and grow effective sales and marketing capabilities, and our sales and marketing efforts may fail to effectively reach customers or effectively communicate the benefits of Panorama;\n\u00b7\nour laboratory partners may choose to offer tests provided by our competitors due to pricing or other reasons, as has happened in the past, or otherwise fail to effectively market Panorama;\n\u00b7\nwe have expanded our direct sales force in the United States, relying to a much greater extent on our direct sales efforts and our own reimbursement arrangements with payers;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience supply constraints, including due to the failure of our key suppliers to provide required sequencers and reagents, including with respect to the required sequencers and reagents from our supplier, Illumina, Inc., which is also one of our main competitors in the NIPT market through its Verinata division;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience increased costs and expenses - for example, we experienced increases in cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from increases in cost per test associated with our microdeletions panel, as well as an increase in test volumes for Horizon, which has a higher cost per test than Panorama;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other U.S. or foreign regulatory or legislative bodies may adopt new regulations or policies, or take other actions that impose significant restrictions on our ability to market and sell Panorama or our other tests, including requiring FDA clearance or approval for the sale of Panorama or of the sequencers, reagents, kits and other consumable products that we purchase from third parties in order to perform our testing;\n\u00b7\na more effective and/or less expensive test for risk assessment of chromosome conditions in fetuses may be developed and commercialized; and\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property relating to Panorama or others may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\nIf the market for Panorama or our market share fail to grow or grow more slowly than expected, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which could harm our future business prospects.\nWe have incurred net losses each year since our inception in 2003. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock, convertible debt and other debt instruments, and our initial public offering. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $70.3 million, $5.2 million and $37.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $250.1 million and $179.8 million, respectively. Such losses are expected to increase in the future as we continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to efforts to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, Panorama and our other products, improve these products, and research and develop future diagnostic solutions, including in the field of cancer. In addition, the rate of growth in our product revenues in the United States as well as internationally has decreased, remaining relatively flat in the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year, and growing only approximately 6% in the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Furthermore, a significant element of our business strategy has been, and will continue to be, to increase our in-network coverage with third-party payers; however, the negotiated fees under our contracts with third-party payers are typically lower than the list price of our tests, and in some cases the third-party payers that we contract with have negative coverage determinations for some of our offerings, such as Panorama for the average-risk pregnancy population. Therefore, going in-network with third-party payers can have an adverse impact on our revenues if we are unable to increase adoption of, and favorable coverage determinations for reimbursement for, our products.\nAs a result of our limited operating history, our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenues, cash flows and profitability, is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. We have also encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in the life sciences and technology industry, such as those described in this report. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or these risks and uncertainties change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations, and our business may suffer.\nUncertainty in the development and commercialization of our enhanced or new tests, including future cancer products, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to effectively introduce enhanced or new tests. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on NIPTs, with an increasing effort to expand our platform and apply our expertise in processing and analyzing cell free DNA to the field of cancer. The development of enhanced or new tests is complex, costly and uncertain. Furthermore, enhancing or developing new tests requires us to accurately anticipate patients', clinicians' and payers' attitudes and needs and emerging technology trends. We may experience research and development, regulatory, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our introduction of enhanced or new tests. The research and development process in molecular diagnostics generally takes a significant amount of time from the research and design stage to commercialization. This process is conducted in various stages, and each stage presents the risk that we will not achieve our goals. For example, any tests that we may enhance or develop may not prove to be clinically effective in clinical trials or otherwise, or we may otherwise have to abandon a test in which we have invested substantial resources.\nThe launch of any new diagnostic tests, including those in the field of cancer, requires the completion of certain clinical development and commercialization activities and the expenditure of additional cash resources. Clinical development requires large numbers of patient specimens and, for certain products, may require large, prospective, and controlled clinical trials. We may not be able to collect a sufficient number of appropriate specimens in a timely manner to complete clinical development for any planned diagnostic test, or we may be unable to afford or manage the large-sized clinical trials that some of our planned future products may require. We cannot assure you that we can successfully complete the clinical development of any other diagnostic test, or that we can establish or maintain the collaborative relationships that may be essential to our clinical development and commercialization efforts. Such failures could prevent or significantly delay our ability to research, develop, complete clinical development and validation, obtain FDA clearance or approval as may be necessary or desired, or launch any of our planned diagnostic tests, including those in the field of cancer. Any failure to complete on-going clinical studies for our planned diagnostic tests could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that:\n\u00b7\nwe will be able to develop any test that meets our desired target product profile in order to address the relevant clinical need or commercial opportunity;\n\u00b7\nwe will be able to obtain necessary regulatory authorizations in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7\nwe will be able to develop the sales and marketing operations or enter into collaborative arrangements to achieve market awareness and demand;\n\u00b7\nwe and our laboratory partners and licensees will successfully market, or healthcare providers will order or use, or third-party payers will reimburse (and if so, to what extent), any tests that we may enhance or develop;\n\u00b7\nany tests that we may enhance or develop can be provided at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality;\n\u00b7\nour current or future competitors will not introduce tests that have superior performance, lower prices or other characteristics that cause physicians to recommend, and consumers to choose, such competitive tests over our enhanced or newly-developed tests; or\n\u00b7\nour tests will not infringe patents held by third parties in key jurisdictions.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could result in delays in the research and development, approval, production, launch, marketing or distribution of enhanced or new tests could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including our revenues, gross margin, profitability and cash flows, may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include, without limitation, those listed elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section. In addition, our quarterly results may fluctuate due to the fact that we recognize costs as they are incurred, but there is typically a delay in the related revenue recognition as we record most revenue only upon receipt of payment. Accordingly, to the extent sales increase, we may experience increased losses unless and until the related revenues are recognized. In addition, as we ramp up our internal sales and marketing and research and development efforts, we expect to incur costs in advance of achieving the anticipated benefits of such efforts. Finally, as we increase utilization of our cloud-based distribution model by additional laboratory licensees, we may experience decreased revenues or slower revenue growth as the cost per test will be lower than for our laboratory-based model. Fluctuations in quarterly results may adversely impact the value of our common stock. We may also face competitive pricing or reimbursement pressures, and we may not be able to maintain our premium pricing in the future, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our laboratory partners do not effectively market or sell, or decide to stop selling, our products, and we are not able to offset the resulting impact to our gross profit through our direct sales efforts or through agreements with new partners, our commercialization activities may be impaired and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWhile we have expanded our U.S. direct sales force to increase our direct sales, a significant element of our commercial strategy remains to establish and leverage relationships with our laboratory partners to sell Panorama and our other products, both in the United States and internationally. Distributing Panorama and our other products through partners reduces our control over our revenues, our market penetration and our gross margin on sales by the partner if we could have otherwise made that sale through our direct sales force. The financial condition of these laboratories could weaken, these laboratory partners could stop selling our products, reduce their marketing efforts in respect of our products, or otherwise breach their agreements with us. Furthermore, our laboratory partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, misappropriate our trade secrets or use our proprietary information in such a way as to expose us to litigation and potential liability. Disagreements or disputes with our laboratory partners, including disagreements over customers, proprietary rights or our or their compliance with contractual obligations, might cause delays or impair the commercialization of Panorama or our other tests, lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to new tests, or result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources and be time consuming and expensive.\nIn addition, we face the risk of our laboratory partners terminating their relationship with us and completely suspending the sale of our products. Both Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, and Progenity, Inc., or Progenity, who were our two largest laboratory partners in 2013, terminated their agreements with us in 2014. Each began promoting the NIPT of a different one of our competitors, and Quest currently promotes its own NIPT. As Quest and Progenity have done, other laboratory partners may decide to exercise their termination rights under our contracts, or any laboratory partner that is not bound by obligations of exclusivity or non-competition to us or our products could decide to sell a competing product and may choose to promote such tests in addition to or in lieu of our tests. Moreover, our partners could merge with or be acquired by a competitor of ours or a company that chooses to de-prioritize the efforts to sell our products. For example, Bio-Reference was acquired by OPKO Health, Inc., and we cannot assure you that this acquisition will not impact, or cause termination of, our agreement with Bio-Reference.\nIf our partnerships are not successful, our ability to increase sales of Panorama and our other products and to successfully execute our strategy could be compromised.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully with either existing or future prenatal testing products or other test methods, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues or achieve profitability.\nWe are in the molecular testing field, which is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing customer preferences, emerging competition, evolving industry standards, and price competition. Our principal competition comes from existing testing methods, technologies and products, including other NIPTs and carrier screening tests offered by our competitors, used by obstetricians and gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, maternal fetal medicine, or MFM, specialists or in vitro fertilization, or IVF, centers. Established, traditional first-line prenatal screening methods, such as serum protein measurement, where doctors measure certain hormones in the blood, and invasive prenatal diagnostic tests like amniocentesis, have been used for many years and are therefore difficult to change or supplement. Moreover, many companies in our markets are offering, or may soon offer, products and services that compete with our tests, in some cases at a lower cost than ours. We cannot assure you that research and discoveries by other companies will not render our existing or potential tests uneconomical or result in tests superior to our existing tests and those we develop. We also cannot assure you that any of our existing tests or tests that we develop will be preferred by patients, physicians or payers to any existing or newly developed technologies or tests.\nWe compete with numerous companies in the genetic diagnostics space. Our competitors in NIPT include Sequenom, Inc., Illumina, Inc., through its Verinata division, Ariosa, Inc., which was acquired by F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd in 2014, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Counsyl, Inc., Quest, Premaitha Health PLC, BGI, and Berry Genomics Co., Ltd. Our competitors in carrier screening include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Counsyl, Inc., Good Start Genetics, Inc., Progenity and Quest. In addition, our future products, such as products in the field of cancer, will face competition from various companies that offer or seek to offer competing solutions. There are currently other companies, such as Guardant Health, Inc. and Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc., that have developed and are offering commercially in the United States clinical cancer diagnostic tests that examine blood samples, rather than solid tumor biopsies, which are the type of cancer diagnostic tests that we are seeking to develop. Additionally, Foundation Medicine, Inc. has announced plans to launch a liquid biopsy test in the first quarter of this year, and Genomic Health Inc. has also announced plans to launch its liquid biopsy test this year. Our planned cancer products are in very early stages of research and development, and we expect that the number of competitors in this space will continue to increase as we conduct our development and commercialization activities.\nSome of our competitors\u2019 products are sold at a lower price than our products. Tests and services being offered or developed by these and other companies could cause sales of our tests and services to decline or force us to reduce our prices. Our current and future competitors could have greater technological, financial, reputational and market access advantages than us, and we may not be able to compete effectively against them. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could harm our revenues, operating income or market share. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues or achieve profitability.\nOur cloud-based distribution model may be difficult to implement.\nWe have only recently begun to deploy our bioinformatics technology for use by other laboratories by making it available through a cloud-based distribution model. This model relies on clinical laboratories in the United States and around the world taking a license from us under which the laboratory would develop and run its own NIPT or other molecular testing assays based on our technology in its own facilities and then access our proprietary algorithms through our Constellation software in the cloud for the analysis of the assay results. In the diagnostics industry, the market for cloud-based solutions and services is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain how quickly and to what extent our cloud-based distribution model will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance.\nDeploying this new cloud-based distribution model involves risks, significant costs and potential liabilities and is dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our management and other employees and our relationship with, and efforts of, our licensees. We do not know whether we can build or support this model to scale. Among the risks to our business and results of operations are the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute the strategy in a timely or efficient manner or at all;\n\u00b7\nour and our licensees' ability to obtain required regulatory authorizations from the FDA and international regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our business and distraction of our employees and management;\n\u00b7\nlicensing portions of our proprietary technology to third parties that may not take the same security precautions as we do to protect this information; and\n\u00b7\nan inability to achieve anticipated benefits and costs savings.\nWe do not know whether clinical laboratories will adopt this method of using our products and services in sufficient volume. As of February 29, 2016, we have signed agreements with only 14 licensees under our cloud-based distribution model. Only three of these licensees, all outside the United States, have commercially launched an NIPT product using Constellation, and one licensee is currently using Constellation commercially to market its non-invasive prenatal paternity test. Other licensees for our cloud-based model are in earlier stages of development and still other potential licensees are in the contract negotiation stage. The rate of adoption of our cloud-based distribution model will depend on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our solution, as well as our ability to address security, privacy and regulatory requirements or concerns. In addition, our cloud-based software will need to be compatible with whatever next-generation sequencing, or NGS, hardware a clinical laboratory is using. Because we do not control the manufacturing and specifications of the NGS equipment, some clinical laboratories may not be able to use this model.\nIf we or other cloud-based solution providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data or disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for cloud-based solutions in the diagnostics industry, including our solutions, may be adversely affected. Such events could also result in potential lawsuits and liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based solutions caused by technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or other challenges, we may not be able to execute our planned business model, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement the cloud-based distribution model or that implementation will result in benefits or cost savings at the levels that we anticipate or at all.\nWe may be unable to commercialize our cloud-based distribution model if we do not comply with ongoing FDA regulatory requirements, including if we are required to obtain FDA clearance to market our software for diagnostic purposes.\nWe utilize our Constellation software to aid in the calculation of test data. Laboratories utilizing our technology may have access to this software in our cloud-based distribution model. It is possible that we will need to obtain regulatory clearance for our Constellation software in order for it to be used by third parties in the conduct of their diagnostic tests based on our technology. We are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the regulatory status of our Constellation software to make calls of copy number variants, which could be used to support our cloud-based distribution model for NIPT in the United States. The FDA has indicated to us that our Constellation software may be appropriate for review under the de novo classification process. However, the FDA has not committed to this position and may take a different position in the future. The FDA has stated that it will not prevent us from marketing Constellation in the United States while we continue to discuss with the FDA how it will be regulated; however, it is possible that the FDA may reverse itself on the issue of our ability to continue to market Constellation during our discussions. The FDA's decision about the appropriate pathway could also be impacted by its plans to regulate LDTs, as outlined in the October 3, 2014 draft guidances described in the risk factor entitled \"-If the FDA were to begin actively regulating our tests as outlined in the FDA's October 3, 2014 draft guidances, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain premarket clearance or approval and incur costs associated with complying with post-market controls.\" If necessary, we intend to seek regulatory clearance for our Constellation software for diagnostic purposes; however, we cannot guarantee\nthat we will obtain clearance. If clearance is required and we are unable to obtain it, we would be unable to commercialize our cloud-based distribution model in the United States.\nIf our Constellation software is regulated as a device, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, including compliance with requirements such as the quality system regulation, or QSR, which establishes extensive requirements for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures; the listing of our devices with the FDA; adverse event and malfunction reporting; corrections and removals reporting; and labeling and promotional requirements. We may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to offer Constellation and may be subject to enforcement action by the FDA, such as the issuance of warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In addition, if a test developed by any of our licensees using our cloud-based distribution model in the United States is found not to be an LDT, or that licensee has difficulty obtaining the reagents and sequencing equipment for any regulatory, supply chain, or other reason, the licensee may not be able to market its test, and we would not receive the revenues anticipated from that licensee.\nImplementation of our cloud-based distribution model may negatively impact our financial results and results of operations.\nUnder our cloud-based distribution model, third party laboratories perform the molecular biology analysis in their own laboratories and access our bioinformatics algorithms in the cloud through our Constellation software to analyze their results. Although we receive license fees for use of our bioinformatics technology, because we do not process these tests and perform the molecular biology analysis in our laboratory, we are not able to charge as high an amount per test as when we perform the entire test ourselves. If our cloud-based distribution model does not lead to a sufficient increase in volume of tests sold to offset the lower revenues per test, our overall revenues will be lower, and our results of operations may be adversely affected, if the reduction in costs from not performing the entire test does not offset the lower revenues per test.\nWe may be subject to increased compliance risks as a result of our rapid growth, including our increased growth in and dependence on our direct sales force.\nThe percentage of our revenues attributable to our U.S. direct sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 77%, 59% and 45%, respectively. During these periods we experienced rapid growth in our internal sales force, which is dispersed throughout the United States, and in our billing and marketing personnel, which has required us to expand our training and compliance efforts in line with the increase in headcount in these functions. We have taken and continue to take steps to implement appropriate monitoring of our sales, billing and other personnel; however, we have in the past experienced, and we cannot assure you that we will not in the future experience, situations in which employees fail to adhere to our policies. To the extent that there is any failure, whether actual or perceived, by our employees to follow our policies, we may incur additional training and compliance costs, or may receive inquiries from third-party payers or other third parties, or be held liable or otherwise responsible for such acts of non-compliance. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party data centers to host our cloud-based software, and any interruptions of service or failures may impair the delivery of our cloud-based software and harm our business.\nWe currently provide and will continue to provide our cloud-based Constellation software to our laboratory licensees through third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States. Any technical problems that may arise in connection with the third-party data center hosting facilities could result in interruptions in our service. These types of problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds, cause laboratory licensees to terminate their contracts with us, or adversely affect our ability to attract new laboratory licensees. We could also be exposed to potential lawsuits and liability claims. Our business will also be harmed if our current or potential laboratory licensees believe our service is unreliable.\nIf our products do not perform as expected, our operating results, reputation and business will suffer.\nOur success depends on the market's confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality genetic testing results. There is no guarantee that the accuracy and reproducibility we have demonstrated to date will continue as our test volume increases and the types of tests we offer expands. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to test limitations and errors, including inaccurate test results and the need on occasion to perform second blood draws on patients. As a result, if our tests do not perform as expected, our operating results, reputation, and business will suffer. We may be subject to legal claims arising from such limitations, errors, or inaccuracies.\nPanorama and our other products use a number of complex and sophisticated biochemical and bioinformatics processes, many of which are highly sensitive to external factors. An operational or technological failure in one of these complex processes or fluctuations in external variables may result in sensitivity and specificity rates that are lower than we anticipate or that vary between test runs, or in a higher than anticipated number of tests which fail to produce results. In addition, we regularly evaluate and refine our testing process. These refinements may result in unanticipated issues that may reduce our sensitivity and specificity rates.\nWe rely on third-party laboratories to perform some of our testing.\nWe and our subsidiaries outsource the portions of testing that we do not perform in-house to third-party CLIA laboratories. A significant portion of our Horizon carrier screening testing is performed by third-party laboratories. These third-party laboratories are subject to contractual obligations to perform this testing for us, but are not otherwise under our control. We therefore do not control the capacity and quality control efforts of these third-party laboratories other than through our ability to enforce contractual obligations on volume and quality systems, and we have no control over such laboratories\u2019 compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In the event of any adverse developments with these third-party laboratories or their ability to perform this testing in accordance with the standards that we and our customers expect, our ability to provide our Horizon test to customers may be delayed or interrupted, which could result in a loss of customers and harm to our reputation. Although we have more than one third-party laboratory performing this testing in order to avoid single sourcing, we may not have sufficient alternative backup if one or more of the third-party laboratories are unable to satisfy our demand for this testing. Any natural or other disaster, acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargoes, labor unrest or political instability or similar events at one or more of our third-party laboratories' facilities that causes a loss of testing capacity would heighten the risks that we face. Changes to or termination of our agreements or inability to renew our agreements with these third-party laboratories or enter into new agreements with other laboratories that are able to perform such testing could impair, delay or suspend our efforts to market and sell the Horizon carrier screening test. In addition, certain third-party payers, including some state Medicaid payers, that we are under contract with may take the position that sending out this testing to third-party laboratories and billing for such tests is contrary to the terms of our contract and may refuse to pay us for the testing. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Some state laws impose anti-markup restrictions that prevent an entity from realizing a profit margin on outsourced testing. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to markup outsourced testing, our revenues and operating margins would suffer.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow revenues for our products in addition to Panorama, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully grow revenues for our products in addition to Panorama, such as Horizon, Spectrum, and Anora, is uncertain and is subject to risks, including that the adoption and demand for such products may not grow as we expect, we may not be able to demonstrate that our products are equivalent to or superior to competing products, we and our laboratory partners may not be able to maintain and grow effective sales and marketing capabilities, our laboratory partners may choose to more actively or exclusively market tests by competitors, we may experience supply constraints, and we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property relating to our products or others may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. If we are not able to increase adoption of and grow revenues for these products, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf the results of our clinical studies do not support the use of our tests, particularly in the average-risk pregnancy population or for microdeletions screening, or cannot be replicated in later studies required for regulatory approvals or clearances, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nAs the healthcare reimbursement system in the United States evolves to place greater emphasis on comparative effectiveness and outcomes data, we cannot predict whether we will have sufficient data, or whether the data we have will be presented to the satisfaction of any payers seeking such data in the process of determining coverage for our tests, particularly in the average-risk pregnancy population for which such data is expected to be of particular interest, or for microdeletions screening using our Panorama test.\nThe publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for tests such as ours, and our inability to control when, if ever, results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenues from any test that is the subject of a study. Peer-reviewed publications regarding our tests may be limited by many factors, including delays in the completion of, poor design of, or lack of compelling data from clinical studies, as well as delays in the review, acceptance and publication process. If our tests or the technology underlying our current tests or future tests do not receive sufficient favorable exposure in peer-reviewed publications, the rate of clinician adoption of our tests and positive reimbursement coverage determinations for our tests could be negatively affected.\nThe administration of clinical and economic utility studies, which are becoming more critical to commercial success, is expensive and demands significant attention from certain members of our management team. Data collected from these studies may not be favorable or consistent with our existing data, or may not be statistically significant or compelling to the medical community.\nIn addition, test development, including development of the data necessary to obtain clearance and approval, is time consuming and carries with it the risk of not yielding the desired results. The performance achieved in published studies may not be repeated in later studies that may be required to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval. Limited results from earlier-stage verification studies may not predict results from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations over a longer period of time. Unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical and clinical studies could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing analytical or future clinical studies, or abandonment of a product development program, or may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or clearances or commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf our sole laboratory facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to perform our tests and our business will be harmed.\nWe do not currently have redundant laboratory facilities, other than third-party laboratories that we employ to perform our Horizon carrier screen testing. Our San Carlos, California laboratory facility is situated near active earthquake fault lines. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable (or samples could be damaged or destroyed) by natural or manmade disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, power outages and contamination, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if our facility is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, single suppliers, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe have sourced and will continue to source components of our technology, including sequencers, reagents, tubes and other laboratory materials, from third parties. In particular, our sequencers, certain reagents and blood collection tubes are sole sourced. For example, Illumina is currently the sole supplier of our sequencers and related reagents for Panorama, along with certain hardware and software, pursuant to a supply agreement that expires in September 2017. Without sequencers and the related reagents, we would be unable to run our tests and commercialize our products. In early 2013, prior to our entering into our agreement with Illumina, Illumina completed its acquisition of Verinata Health Inc.,\nour direct competitor in the NIPT market. We understand Illumina supplies the same or similar sequencers and consumables to Verinata. Because of Illumina's acquisition of Verinata, we face increased risk and uncertainty regarding continuity of a successful working relationship with Illumina under the current supply agreement, including with respect to our ability to compete with Verinata in the marketplace based on test price and in view of economic advantages enjoyed by Verinata associated with the cost of sequencers and related consumables. We also face risk and uncertainty regarding our ability to renew the supply agreement at all or on financial or commercial terms that are attractive or acceptable to us. Our failure to maintain a continued supply of the sequencers and reagents, along with the right to use certain hardware and software, would adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event that it is in our commercial or financial interest or we are forced to transition sequencing platforms, we may not be successful in selecting, acquiring on commercially reasonable terms, and implementing an alternative platform that is satisfactory for our needs or that we can employ in a commercially sustainable way.\nIn addition, Streck, Inc. is the sole supplier of the blood collection tubes included in our Panorama test. The blood collection tubes are intended for research use only and are labeled as RUO. As discussed further in the risk factor entitled \u201c-Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, other consumables, and testing equipment we use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our tests to market or performing such tests for our customers,\u201d the FDA may determine that a product labeled RUO is intended to be used diagnostically, and could take enforcement action against the supplier of the product. If this were to occur with respect to Streck or any of our other suppliers of RUO products, we would be required to obtain one or more alternative sources of these products, and we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur failure to maintain a continued supply of components, or a supply that meets quality control requirements, particularly in the case of sole suppliers, would materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes to or termination of our agreements or inability to renew our agreements with these parties or enter into new agreements with other suppliers could result in the loss of access to important components of our tests and could impair, delay or suspend our commercialization efforts, including efforts to market and commercialize Panorama. In the event of any adverse developments with our sole suppliers, our ability to supply our products may be interrupted, and obtaining substitute components could be difficult or require us to re-design our products or, for any products for which we may obtain approval from the FDA, obtain approval from the FDA to use a new supplier. In addition, if we were to obtain a PMA for Panorama and we subsequently need to modify Panorama because of issues with suppliers described above, the FDA could require us to obtain a PMA supplement prior to making the change, which would require additional time and expense and could impair or delay our commercialization efforts. Transitioning to a new supplier from any of our sole suppliers could be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our ability to supply our products to the market, could affect the performance specifications of our tests or could require that we re-validate Panorama and our other tests using replacement equipment and supplies, which could delay the performance of our tests and result in increased costs.\nBecause we rely on third-party manufacturers, we do not control the manufacture of these components, including whether such components will meet quality control requirements. If the supply of components we receive do not meet quality control standards, we may not be able to use the components, or if we use them not knowing that they are of inadequate quality, which has in the past occurred with respect to certain reagents, it may prevent our tests from working properly or at all. Because we cannot ensure the actual production or manufacture of such critical equipment and materials, or the quality of such components, or the ability of our suppliers to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we may be subject to significant delays caused by interruption in production or manufacturing or to lost revenue from such interruption or from spoiled tests. In addition, any natural or other disaster, acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargoes, labor unrest or political instability or similar events at our third-party manufacturers' facilities that causes a loss of manufacturing capacity would heighten the risks that we face.\nWe rely on commercial courier delivery services to transport samples to our laboratory facility in a timely and cost-efficient manner and if these delivery services are disrupted, our business will be harmed.\nOur business depends on our ability to quickly and reliably deliver test results to our customers. We typically receive blood samples for analysis at our San Carlos, California facility within days of collection from the patient. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to labor disruptions, bad weather, natural disaster, terrorist acts or threats or\nfor other reasons could adversely affect specimen integrity, our ability to process samples in a timely manner and to service our customers, and ultimately our reputation and our business. In addition, if we are unable to continue to obtain expedited delivery services on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions, including with respect to cybersecurity, could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally-protected health information, such as Panorama results, credit card and other financial information, insurance information, and personally identifiable information. We also store sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our customers, payers and collaboration partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based data center systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information, including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information. We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit, and store this critical information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider and other technology partners, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.\nAny such breach or interruption could compromise our data security, and the information we store could be inaccessible by us or could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such interruption in access, improper access, disclosure, modification, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and regulatory penalties. We may be required to comply with state breach notification laws, become subject to mandatory corrective action, or be required to verify the correctness of database contents. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to perform tests, provide test results, bill payers or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, develop and commercialize tests, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our tests, educate patients and clinicians about our service, and manage the administrative aspects of our business, any of which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may compound these adverse consequences. Any such breach could also result in the compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur cloud-based distribution model adds additional data privacy risk, as certain personal health and other information may be sent to and stored in the cloud by our laboratory licensees. We have contractually obligated our partners to not send personally-identifiable information to our cloud servers, and we have an agreement with the vendor that hosts our software in the cloud to comply with data privacy laws, such as HIPAA. However, we cannot be certain that our partners will comply with these requirements or that our cloud vendor will comply with the terms of our agreement.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of health-related, privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. Complying with these laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of Panorama and our other products could result in substantial damages arising from product liability or professional liability claims that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of Panorama and our other products could lead to product liability claims against us if someone were to allege that our test failed to perform as it was designed, or if someone were to misinterpret test results. In addition, we may be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the\ninformation we provide, or failure to provide such information, as part of the results generated by Panorama and our other products. For example, Panorama could provide a low-risk result which a patient or physician may rely upon to make a conclusion about the health of the fetus, which may, in fact, have the condition because the Panorama result was a so-called false negative. If the resulting baby is born with the condition, the family may file a lawsuit against us claiming product or professional liability. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product and professional liability insurance, our insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. Any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability or professional liability lawsuit could harm our reputation, result in a cessation of our services or cause our partners to terminate our agreements with them, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully scale our operations to support demand for Panorama, our business could suffer.\nAs our test volumes grow, we will need to continue to ramp up our testing capacity, implement increases in scale and related processing, customer service, billing and systems process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program and technology platform. We will also need additional equipment, laboratory space and certified laboratory personnel to process higher volumes of our tests. As additional tests are developed, we may need to bring new equipment on-line, implement new systems, technology, controls and procedures, and hire personnel with different qualifications. The value of Panorama and our other products depends, in part, on our ability to perform the tests on a timely basis and at an exceptionally high standard of quality, and on our reputation for such timeliness and quality. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new equipment or processes or to hire the necessary personnel in a timely and effective manner could result in higher processing costs or an inability to meet market demand. We cannot assure you that our efforts to scale our commercial operations will not negatively affect the quality of our test process or results, or that we will be successful in managing the growing complexity of our testing operations.\nIn addition, our growth may place a significant strain on our management, operating and financial systems and our sales, marketing and administrative resources. As a result of our growth, our operating costs may escalate even faster than planned, and some of our internal systems may need to be enhanced or replaced. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations and our costs, we may not be able to grow successfully or we may grow at a slower pace, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is susceptible to costs and risks associated with international operations.\nAs part of our ongoing growth strategy, we intend to continue to expand within and target select international markets to grow our revenues outside the United States. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks, including:\n\u00b7\nuncertain or changing laws, regulatory registration and approval processes associated with Panorama and other current and future products;\n\u00b7\nuncertain reimbursement by third-party payers;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from companies located in the countries in which we offer our tests, and in which we may be at a competitive disadvantage because the country may favor a local provider or for other reasons;\n\u00b7\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nlower margins due to lower pricing in many countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and assuring compliance with U.S. and international anti-bribery and other regulations and laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, or the UKBA;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate structure and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nincreases in financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, preferential bidding or import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, including terrorist attacks and security concerns;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u00b7\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights.\nAdditionally, operating internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to increase international revenues or expand or establish operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.\nOutside the United States we enlist local and regional laboratories and other service providers to assist with blood draw, sales, marketing and customer support. Subject to regulatory clearance, where required, we have begun to contract with international licensees to run the molecular portion of our tests in their own labs and then access our algorithm for analysis of the resulting data through our cloud-based Constellation platform. Locating, qualifying and engaging additional distribution partners and local laboratories with local industry experience and knowledge will be necessary to effectively market and sell our tests outside the United States. We may not be successful in finding, attracting and retaining such distribution partners or laboratories, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Sales practices utilized by our distribution partners that are locally acceptable may not comply with sales practice standards required under United States laws that apply to us, which could create additional compliance risk. Even if we are able to effectively manage our international operations, if our distribution partners and local and regional laboratory licensees are unable to effectively manage their businesses, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. If our sales and marketing efforts are not successful outside the United States, we may not achieve market acceptance for our tests outside the United States, which would harm our business.\nIf we lose the services of our founder and Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management team. In particular, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Rabinowitz, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products and technology. Although Dr. Rabinowitz spends significant time with us and is highly active in our management, he has the ability to spend up to one business day per week on prior commitments pursuant to his employment agreement. In addition, we do not maintain key-man insurance for Dr. Rabinowitz or any other member of our senior management team. The loss of our founder and Chief Executive Officer or one or more other members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAn inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for sales, scientific, medical, laboratory and technical personnel and especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters and laboratory facilities are located, and the turnover rate can be high. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations to their former employers, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees in the San Francisco Bay Area often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity\nawards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders or reduce our financial resources.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies. Because we have not made any acquisitions to date, our ability to do so successfully is unproven. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue shares of our common stock or other equity securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by any indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management attention from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and if we cannot do so when needed or on commercially acceptable terms, we may have to curtail or cease operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements to continue to fund or expand our operations.\nOur actual liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve broader commercial success with Panorama, Horizon and our other products;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our research, development, and commercialization efforts for potential new products, including in the field of cancer;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain more extensive coverage and reimbursement for our tests, including in the average-risk patient population and for microdeletions screening;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate sufficient revenues from our cloud-based distribution model;\n\u00b7\nour ability to collect our accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and success of further expansion of our sales and marketing activities and research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nour need to finance capital expenditures and further expand our clinical laboratory operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manage our operating costs; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing and results of any regulatory authorizations that we are required to obtain for our tests.\nAdditional capital, if needed, may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities will dilute stockholders' ownership interests in us and may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect stockholders' holdings or rights. Debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise\ncapital through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate funding when needed, we may have to delay development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our tests or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to our company.\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $42.1 million and $26.8 million, respectively, of debt outstanding. Except for operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations, and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness. In addition, our debt agreements have in the past, and may in the future, contain various restrictive covenants and may be secured by some or all of our assets, including our intellectual property. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt.\nEthical, legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests.\nDNA testing, like that conducted using Panorama, Horizon and our other products and that we expect to conduct in the field of cancer, has raised ethical, legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genomic information or genomic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use genetic tests even if permissible. Ethical and social concerns may also influence U.S. and foreign patent offices and courts with regard to patent protection for technology relevant to our business. These and other ethical, legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance of our tests or reduce the potential markets for services and products enabled by our technology platform, either of which could harm our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. Our reliance on independent laboratories to sell Panorama and other products internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents, and we could be held responsible for their actions. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with foreign government officials. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom's Bribery Act of 2010, which went into effect in 2011, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. As a result of our most recent private placements of equity securities and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, or upon our recent initial public offering, we may have experienced an \"ownership change.\" We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which may not be in our control). As of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $114.5 million and $73.2 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2017, respectively, if not utilized. We also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $4.6 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $3.4 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Our ability to use these carryforwards could be limited if we experience \"ownership changes.\"\nReimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to expand or maintain third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for Panorama and our other tests, or if we are required to refund any reimbursements already received, our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party payers and patients. Third-party reimbursement for our testing represents a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect third-party payers such as insurance companies and government healthcare programs to be our most significant source of payments going forward. In particular, we believe that expanding insurance coverage from the high-risk to the average-risk pregnancy population, which represents roughly 80% of the United States pregnancy market, and for microdeletions screening, and obtaining positive coverage decisions and favorable reimbursement rates from commercial third-party payers and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and state reimbursement programs for Panorama, will be necessary to continue to achieve commercial success. If we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement coverage from, or achieve in-network status with, third-party payers for our existing tests or future tests, our ability to generate revenues would be limited. For example, physicians may be reluctant to order our tests due to the potential of a substantial cost to the patient if reimbursement coverage is unavailable or insufficient.\nIn making coverage determinations, third-party payers often rely on practice guidelines issued by professional societies. The International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, or ISPD, has issued guidelines and the American College of Medical Genetics, or ACMG, has issued a statement that are supportive of NIPT in average-risk pregnancies, as well as high-risk pregnancies. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, or SMFM, has issued guidelines for NIPT stating that, while all pregnant women should be informed of the option to receive NIPT, conventional screening methods, rather than NIPT, remain the most appropriate choice for first-line screening for average-risk pregnancies. While we expect that, based on the ACOG and SMFM guidelines, more average-risk women will be informed of NIPT and may request it, it is uncertain whether third-party payers will reimburse for NIPT for these average-risk patients. Currently, most third-party payers have negative coverage determinations for average-risk patient populations, meaning that their policy is not to reimburse for NIPT for patients in the average-risk population. The ACOG and SMFM guidelines also echoed a previous statement from SMFM that routine screening for microdeletions should not be performed. Some third-party payers do not reimburse for microdeletions screening. While we recently published data on the performance of Panorama for the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ACOG and SMFM's advising against screening for microdeletions may continue to have a negative impact on third-party payers' reimbursement for Panorama for microdeletions, at least until additional validation data on the sensitivity and specificity of our tests becomes available. If third-party payers do not reimburse for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies or microdeletions in the future, our future revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe reimbursement environment, particularly for molecular diagnostics, is changing and our efforts to broaden reimbursement for our tests with third-party payers may not be successful. Third-party payers from whom we have\nreceived reimbursement may withdraw coverage or decrease the amount of reimbursement coverage for our tests at any time and for any reason. In some cases, our tests or their uses with certain populations may be considered experimental by third-party payers and, as a result, such payers may decide not to reimburse for such tests. In addition, third-party payers may decide to bundle payment for multiple tests, such as carrier screen tests or our Panorama test and the separate Panorama screen for microdeletions, into a single payment rate. Third-party payers may also decide to deny payment or recoup payment for testing that they determine to have been not medically necessary or otherwise against their coverage determinations, and we may be required to refund reimbursements already received. We have dealt with these types of requests for recoupment from third-party payers from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, and it is possible that we will continue to do so in the future.\nFurthermore, some of our contracts with third-party payers contain most favored nations provisions, pursuant to which we have agreed that we will not bill the third-party payer more than we bill any other third-party payer. We must therefore monitor and manage our compliance with our contractual requirements with third-party payers, and if we are unable to do so, our revenues could be adversely affected by claims for refunds. These claims could also require the time and attention of our management, and may be a distraction from development of our business.\nIn addition, if a third-party payer denies coverage, it may be difficult for us to collect from the patient, and we may not be successful in doing so. Further, we are often unable to collect the full amount of a patient\u2019s responsibility where we are an out-of-network provider and the patient is left with a large balance, despite our good faith efforts to collect. As a result, we cannot always collect the full amount due for our tests when third-party payers deny coverage, cover only a portion of the invoiced amount or the patient has a large deductible, which may raise questions regarding our billing policies and collection practices. We believe that our billing policies and our collection practices are compliant with applicable laws and our obligations to these payers. However, we have in the past received, and we may in the future receive, inquiries from third-party payers regarding our billing policies and collection practices, and we have addressed these inquiries as and when they have arisen. There is no guarantee that we will always be successful in addressing such concerns, possibly resulting in a third-party payer deciding to reimburse for our tests at a lower amount or not at all, may seek repayment of amounts previously paid to us, or may bring legal action seeking reimbursement of previous amounts paid, any of which could cause reimbursement revenue for our testing to decline. Furthermore, if a third-party payer were to be successful in proving such reimbursement was in breach of contract or otherwise contrary to law, we could be required to make a repayment, which could be significant, and we might be required to restate our financials from a prior period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are aware of policies and practices of our competitors, including privately-held and publicly-traded companies, to offer patients a set cap on their out-of-pocket responsibility, waive patient responsibility altogether, and, in some cases, to not send patients a bill at all, all of which we believe is not in accordance with third-party payers' policies and, in some cases, not compliant with the law. In contrast, it is our policy not to offer such caps or waivers and to send bills to patients for services rendered. Because of this discrepancy, our offerings may be perceived as less attractive to patients and their healthcare providers, who are concerned about patients having a large financial responsibility for these products. As a result, we believe that our revenues and results of operations have been adversely affected, and may continue to be so affected to the extent such competitors continue such practices.\nOur revenues may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully obtain reimbursement from the Medicare Program.\nOur revenues from Medicare are currently very small, given the population that Medicare covers, and we do not expect those revenues to increase materially with regard to NIPT. However, Medicare reimbursement can affect Medicaid reimbursement. For example, fee-for-service Medicaid programs generally do not reimburse at rates that exceed Medicare's fee-for-service rates and many commercial third-party payers look to the amounts that Medicare pays for testing services and set their payment rates at a percentage of those amounts. Reimbursement amounts for laboratory tests furnished to Medicare beneficiaries are typically based on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, set by CMS pursuant to a statutory formula established by the U.S. Congress. Our current Medicare Part B reimbursement was not set pursuant to a national coverage determination by CMS. Although we believe that coverage is available under Medicare Part B even without such a determination, we currently lack the national coverage certainty afforded by a formal coverage\ndetermination by CMS. Thus, CMS could issue an adverse coverage determination as to Panorama which could influence other third-party payers, including Medicaid, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nOur revenues may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully obtain reimbursement from state Medicaid programs.\nApproximately 40% of all births in the United States are to state Medicaid program recipients. Under Medicaid regulations, in order for us to be reimbursed by a state\u2019s Medicaid program, we must be recognized as a Medicaid provider by the state in which the Medicaid recipient receiving the services resides. As of December 31, 2015, we are recognized by 37 states as a Medicaid provider. We may not be able to be recognized as a provider by many more Medicaid programs, because some states require that a provider maintain a laboratory in that state in order to be recognized. In addition, we may face challenges in obtaining reimbursement even when we are recognized as a Medicaid provider. If Medicare\u2019s CLFS rate for our services and tests are low, the Medicaid reimbursement amounts will also likely be as low, or lower, than the Medicare reimbursement rate. In some cases, the state Medicaid program\u2019s reimbursement rate for our testing might be zero dollars. In addition, each state\u2019s Medicaid program has its own coverage determinations related to our testing, and some state Medicaid programs may not provide their recipients with coverage for our testing. Low Medicaid reimbursement rates for our tests could have an adverse effect on our business and revenues.\nMany Medicaid programs have entered into agreements with managed care plans to have the managed care plans manage the provision of healthcare to that Medicaid program\u2019s beneficiaries. We cannot enter into contracts to provide our testing services to any beneficiaries who are enrolled with a Medicaid managed care plan in those states where we are not recognized as a Medicaid provider. Further, we might not be able to obtain contracts with Medicaid managed care plans in those states where we are recognized as a Medicaid provider because those managed care plans may have closed provider panels and not allow us to participate in their plan. Thus, not being able to participate in one or more managed Medicaid plans in a given state could have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nOur revenues may be adversely impacted if third-party payers withdraw coverage or provide lower levels of reimbursement due to changing policies, billing complexities or other factors.\nSome third-party payers from whom we have received reimbursement to date have not entered into agreements with us to govern approval or payment terms. Therefore, such third-party payers could withdraw such coverage and reimbursement for our tests in the future, at any time and for any reason. Managing reimbursement on a case-by-case basis is time consuming and contributes to an increase in the number of days it takes us to collect on accounts, and increases our risk of non-payment. Negotiating reimbursement on a case-by-case basis also typically results in the receipt of reimbursement at a significant discount to the list price of our tests.\nFurther, even if we are under contract with a third-party payer, the contract does not guarantee reimbursement for all testing we perform. For example, third-party payers with whom we have written agreements typically have policies that state they will not reimburse for use of NIPTs in the average-risk pregnancy population or for the screening of microdeletions. In addition, the terms of certain of our agreements may require us to seek pre-approval from the third-party payer or put in place other controls and procedures prior to conducting a test. To the extent we do not follow these requirements, we may not receive some or all of the reimbursement payments to which we would otherwise be entitled.\nEven if we are being reimbursed for our tests, third-party payers may review and adjust the rate of reimbursement, require co-payments from patients or stop paying for our tests. Government healthcare programs and other third-party payers continue to increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting coverage of, and amounts they will pay for, molecular diagnostic tests. These measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry. Because of these cost-containment trends, governmental and commercial third-party payers that currently provide reimbursement for, or may in the future cover, our tests may reduce, suspend, revoke or discontinue payments or coverage at any time. Reduced reimbursement of our tests may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex. We perform tests in advance of payment and without certainty as to the outcome of the billing process. In cases where we expect to receive a fixed fee per test due to our\nreimbursement arrangements, we may nevertheless encounter disputes over pricing and billing. Each third-party payer typically has different billing requirements, and the billing requirements of many payers have become increasingly difficult to meet.\nAmong the factors complicating our billing of third-party payers are:\n\u00b7\ndisparity in coverage among various payers;\n\u00b7\ndisparity in information and billing requirements among payers; and\n\u00b7\nincorrect or missing billing information, which is required to be provided by the prescribing health care practitioner.\nThese risks related to billing complexities, and the associated uncertainty in obtaining payment for our tests, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, the American Medical Association, or AMA, generally assigns specific billing codes for laboratory tests under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, which we and our customers must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare while private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. A new CPT code specific to NIPT for aneuploidies came into effect in January 2015. Additionally, CMS adopted a new code set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10, in October 2015. The AMA has recently issued a CPT code for microdeletions, which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2017; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate favorable rates for this code. We do not currently have specific CPT codes assigned for all of our tests, and there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain such codes, or if obtained, we may not be able to negotiate favorable rates for such codes. We currently submit for reimbursement using CPT codes that, based on the guidance of outside legal and coding experts, are determined to be the most appropriate for our testing, but there is a risk that these codes may be rejected or withdrawn or that third-party payers will seek refunds of amounts that they claim were inappropriately billed based on either the CPT code used, or the number of units billed. We accordingly cannot guarantee that our current or any future tests will have a CPT code assigned. In addition, there can be no guarantees that governmental and commercial third-party payers will establish positive or adequate coverage policies for our tests or reimbursement rates for any CPT code we may use.\nIf the FDA were to begin actively regulating our tests as outlined in the FDA's October 3, 2014 draft guidances, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain premarket clearance or approval and incur costs associated with complying with post-market controls.\nWe currently offer a number of prenatal genetic tests, including Panorama, and each of those tests is an LDT. In addition, we currently anticipate initially commercializing our planned cancer tests as LDTs. An LDT is generally considered to be a test that is designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA takes the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, but it has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to LDTs. This means that even though the FDA believes it can impose regulatory requirements on LDTs, such as requirements to obtain premarket approval or clearance of LDTs, it has generally chosen not to enforce those requirements to date.\nOn October 3, 2014, the FDA issued draft guidances outlining its plan to actively regulate LDTs using a risk-based approach. The comment period for the draft guidances has closed; the draft guidances have not yet been finalized. According to the draft guidances, the FDA intends to fully regulate, in a phased-in manner, LDTs that it considers moderate-risk or high-risk, beginning with those within the high-risk category it considers \"highest-risk devices.\" With regard to premarket review, under the proposed guidances, the highest-risk LDTs will be the subject of premarket submissions 12 months after the guidances are finalized. Premarket submission requirements will be phased in over the following four years for the remaining high-risk LDTs. Then, beginning after year five, moderate-risk LDTs will be required to be the subject of premarket submissions.\nBased on our current understanding of the draft guidances, our current tests, including Panorama, would be treated as moderate-risk or high-risk. We do not expect that our current tests will be among the highest-risk devices. The FDA has indicated that high- and moderate-risk LDTs that are on the market if and when the draft guidances are finalized will remain on the market while the FDA reviews the submissions. We do not expect that we will be required to remove any of our current products from the market based on any final guidance if we comply with the requirements outlined in such final guidance.\nThe FDA's proposed framework in the draft guidances outlines post-market controls, including registration and listing or FDA notification, corrections and removals reporting and adverse event reporting, that would be required of all LDTs except those for forensic (law enforcement) use and certain LDTs for transplantation. For moderate- or high-risk tests, it also would require compliance with the QSR at the time the FDA clears a 510(k) for a test or the laboratory submits a PMA for a test. We would need to comply with these controls, which will be costly and time-consuming, and if we fail to comply we could be subject to enforcement action.\nThe regulation by the FDA of LDTs remains uncertain. The draft guidances have been the subject of considerable controversy, and it is unclear whether or when the FDA will finalize the guidances, or whether any final guidances would be substantially revised from the draft versions. In addition, Congress may act to provide further direction to the FDA on the regulation of LDTs.\nIn the meantime, the FDA could require us to seek clearance or approval to offer our tests for clinical use even before it finalizes any future guidance. If FDA premarket review or approval is required, or if we decide to voluntarily pursue FDA review or approval, for any of our existing or future tests, we may be forced to stop selling our tests or we may be required to modify claims or make other changes to our tests while we work to obtain FDA clearance or approval. Our business would be adversely affected while such review is ongoing and if we are ultimately unable to obtain premarket clearance or approval. For example, the regulatory 510(k) clearance or PMA process may involve, among other things, successfully completing analytical, pre-clinical and/or clinical studies beyond the studies we have already performed for each of our products and would involve submitting a premarket notification or filing a PMA application with the FDA. Performance achieved in published studies may not be repeated in later studies that would be required to obtain either FDA premarket clearance or approval. Limited results from earlier-stage verification studies, beyond the validation and other studies we have already performed for each of our products, may not accurately predict results from studies of larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations over a longer period of time. Unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical and clinical studies could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical studies, or abandonment of a product development program or may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. In addition, we may require cooperation in our filings for FDA approval from third-party manufacturers of the components of our tests. If we are unable to obtain such required cooperation, we may be unable to achieve desired regulatory clearances or approvals. Furthermore, if FDA premarket review or approval is required, our cash flows may be adversely affected, as most third party payers, including Medicaid, will not reimburse for use of medical devices which are required to be cleared or approved but which have not been.\nWe have informed the FDA of our intent to actively pursue a PMA for Panorama. We cannot assure you that Panorama or any of our other tests for which we pursue or are required to obtain premarket review by the FDA will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, if a test has been approved through a PMA, certain changes that we may make to improve the test may need to be approved by the FDA before we can implement them, which could increase the time to roll such changes out to the commercial market. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements, any of which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the FDA or the Federal Trade Commission may object to the materials and methods we use to promote the use of our current prenatal tests or other LDTs we may develop in the future, and may initiate enforcement actions against us. Enforcement actions by the FDA may include, among others, untitled or warning letters; fines; injunctions; civil or criminal penalties; recall or seizure of current or future tests, products or services; operating restrictions and partial suspension or total shutdown of production.\nChanges in laws and regulations, or in their application, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is highly regulated, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory, supervisory or licensing requirements may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the laws and regulations governing the marketing and research of clinical diagnostic testing are extremely complex and in many instances there are no clear regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations, which increases the risk that we may be found to be in violation of these laws.\nFurthermore, the molecular diagnostics industry as a whole is a growing industry and regulatory agencies such as Health and Human Services, or HHS, or the FDA may apply heightened scrutiny to new developments in the field. While we have taken steps to ensure compliance with the current regulatory regime in all material respects, given its nature and our geographical diversity, there could be areas where we are non-compliant. Any change in the laws or regulations relating to our business may require us to implement changes to our business or practices, and we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner. Should we be found to be non-compliant with regulatory requirements, we may be subject to sanctions which could include required changes to our operations, adverse publicity, substantial financial penalties and criminal proceedings, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our cost of compliance or limiting our ability to develop, market and commercialize our tests.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased U.S. federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, which are governed by laws and regulations including the Stark law. Among other requirements, the Stark law requires laboratories to track, and places a cap on, non-monetary compensation provided to referring physicians.\nWhile we have a compliance plan to address compliance with government laws and regulations, including applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, the evolving commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and scalable systems to comply with regulations in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that we could inadvertently violate one or more of these requirements.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by CMS' adoption of the new code set for diagnoses.\nCMS has adopted a new code set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10, which significantly expands the code set for diagnoses. As required, we implemented the new code set on October 1, 2015. Our failure or the failure of third-party payers or health care practitioners to properly transition to the use of ICD-10 codes within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. In addition, health care practitioners may fail to provide appropriate codes for ordered tests leading to delays in billing, which could result in increased costs and decreased collection of payment. As a result, we could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations require clinical laboratories to obtain a certificate and mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management and quality assurance. CLIA certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for our tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical laboratory.\nWe are also required to maintain certain state licenses to conduct testing in our laboratories. California law establishes standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory in San Carlos, California, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control matters. We maintain a license in good standing with the California Department of Health Services, or DHS. In addition, we have obtained a license for our San Carlos laboratory from the New York Department of Health, or DOH, which mandates proficiency testing regardless of whether such laboratories are\nlocated in New York. If we are found to be out of compliance with either California or New York requirements, DHS or DOH may, among others, suspend, restrict or revoke our license for that state, assess substantial civil monetary penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially and adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, some states require that we hold licenses to test samples from patients in those states. We have obtained licenses from states that we believe require us to do so, and we intend to comply with similar requirements that we may become aware of for any other states. However, we cannot assure you that the regulators in each of the states that regulate our laboratory in San Carlos, California will at all times find us to be in compliance with the applicable laws of their respective state, which may result in suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of our laboratory\u2019s license for that state, censure, or civil monetary penalties, and would result in our inability to test samples from patients in that state.\nCMS also has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions, including revocation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of any CLIA-certified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA certification or any required state license, or if any sanction were imposed upon us under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or any failure by us to renew a CLIA certificate, a state license or accreditation, we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratory and offer our testing services, in some or all states or countries, which would materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges in government healthcare policy could increase our costs and negatively impact coverage and reimbursement for our tests by governmental and other third-party payers.\nThe U.S. government has shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform and reducing healthcare costs. Government healthcare policy has been and, we expect, will continue to be a topic of extensive legislative and executive activity in the U.S. federal and many U.S. state governments. As a result, our business could be affected by significant and potentially unanticipated changes in government healthcare policy, such as changes in reimbursement levels by public third-party payers. Any of these or other changes could substantially impact our revenues, increase costs and divert management attention from our business strategy. Going forward, we cannot predict the full impact of governmental healthcare policy changes on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the PPACA, was signed into law in March 2010 and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries, including the diagnostics sector, in a number of ways. Members of Congress have proposed a number of legislative initiatives with respect to the PPACA, including possible repeal of the PPACA; and although the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of certain provisions of the PPACA that have been challenged, at this time it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to certain provisions or the entirety of PPACA.\nCurrently, under the PPACA, each medical device manufacturer that sells medical devices that are listed with the FDA is required to pay a sales tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price at which it sells such medical devices. None of our tests are currently listed with the FDA. FDA officials have indicated that a laboratory will not have to pay the sales tax until it lists the test with the FDA. In the FDA's draft guidances on LDTs, listing of an LDT, such as our tests, occurs at the time a laboratory submits either a PMA or 510(k) for the test. If the guidances are finalized as currently drafted, the application of this tax to our clinical LDTs could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations. The tax has from time to time been subject to legislative and executive discussion regarding potential repeal.\nThe PPACA also created a new system of health insurance \"exchanges,\" designed to make health insurance policies available to individuals and certain groups through state- or federally-administered marketplaces in addition to existing channels for obtaining health insurance coverage. In connection with such exchanges, certain \"essential health benefits\" are intended to be made more consistent across plans, setting a baseline coverage level. The states (and the federal government) have some discretion in determining the definition of \"essential health benefits\" and we cannot predict at this time whether Panorama or our other tests will fall into a benefit category deemed \"essential\" for coverage purposes across\nthe plans offered in any or all of the exchanges. If Panorama or any of our other tests are not covered by plans offered in the health insurance exchanges, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. We believe we are in compliance with provisions of the PPACA that are applicable to us, and are monitoring the trends and changes resulting from the legislation that may impact our business over time, but cannot assure you that our business will not be adversely impacted by any such trends and changes.\nIn addition to the PPACA, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged from federal and state governments. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, introduces a multi-year pricing program for services paid under the CLFS that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. CMS, which is responsible for implementing PAMA, has issued a proposed rule for implementation of PAMA. Under the proposed rule, certain laboratories would be required to report third-party payer rates and test volumes. For newly developed advanced diagnostic tests for which there is no CLFS payment amount, the Medicare payment rate for the first full three calendar quarters following the quarter that the tests are offered would be the actual list price offered to third-party payers. Thereafter, CMS would use the data reported by laboratories during this period to establish payment rates for such newly developed advanced diagnostic tests. The comment period for this proposed rule has closed, but CMS has not yet released a final rule. In addition, federal budgetary limitations and changes in healthcare policy, such as the creation of broad limits for our tests or requirements that beneficiaries of government health plans pay for, or pay for higher, portions of clinical laboratory tests or services received, could substantially diminish the sale, or inhibit the utilization, of our tests in the future, increase costs and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or how any such future legislation, regulation or initiative may affect us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion of government's role in the U.S. healthcare industry, as well as changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by payers for our current and future tests, may adversely affect the volumes of services and tests that we provide and may therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we or our laboratory partners, consultants or commercial partners act in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws or otherwise engage in misconduct, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, which created federal civil and criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and also imposes obligations with respect to maintenance of the privacy and security, and transmission, of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing informed consents for genetic testing and the use of genetic material;\n\u00b7\nstate laws and regulations governing the submission of claims, as well as billing and collection practices, for healthcare services;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act which prohibits, among other things, the presentation of false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government-funded third-party payers ;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above U.S. federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers;\n\u00b7\nfederal laws and regulations governing the Medicare program, providers of services covered by the Medicare program, and the submission of claims to the Medicare program, as well as the Medicare Manuals issued by CMS and the local medical policies promulgated by the Medicare Administrative Contractors with respect to the implementation and interpretation of such laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Stark physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program (and according to case law in some jurisdictions, the Medicaid program as well), including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition, as well as state law equivalents of the Stark law;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies; and\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition on reassignment by the program beneficiary of Medicare claims to any party.\nFurthermore, a development affecting our industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act's \"whistleblower\" or \"qui tam\" provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payer program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government for violations of the False Claims Act and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it is subject to mandatory damages of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, and in some cases go even further because many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program.\nMany of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. We have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws, and in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. However, the rapid growth and expansion of our business both within and outside of the United States may increase the potential for violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures, and the uncertainty around the interpretation of these laws and regulations increases the risk that we may be found in violation of these or other laws and regulations. If our operations, including the conduct of our employees, distributors, consultants and commercial partners, are found to be in violation of any laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, as described below, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe federal HIPAA privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, health care providers, and health care clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u00b7\nthe circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and its health care operations activities;\n\u00b7\na patient\u2019s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;\n\u00b7\nthe content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information;\n\u00b7\nadministrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and\n\u00b7\nthe protection of computing systems that maintain protected health information.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations as required by law. The privacy and security regulations establish minimum requirements, and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and various state privacy and security laws and regulations. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other specified permitted purposes. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. We could also incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. In addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretation by various governmental authorities and courts, resulting in complex compliance issues.\nIn addition, laws and regulations of the European Union, as well as other countries, protect the use and disclosure of personal information. As we continue to expand and grow our business, compliance with these laws and regulations may result in increased costs, and failure to comply may result in significant fines, penalties and damage to our reputation.\nChanges in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, other consumables, and testing equipment we use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our tests to market or performing such tests for our customers.\nMany of the sequencers, reagents, kits and other consumable products used to perform our prenatal testing, as well as the instruments and other capital equipment that enable the testing, are offered for sale as analyte specific reagents, or ASRs, or for research use only, or RUO. ASRs consist of single reagents or primer pairs, which are intended for use in a diagnostic application for the identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance in biological specimens. As medical devices, ASRs must comply with the QSR provisions and other device requirements, but most are exempt from the 510(k) and PMA premarket review processes. Products that are intended for research use only and are labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements, including the approval or clearance and other product quality requirements for medical devices. A product labeled RUO but intended for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and subject to FDA enforcement action. The FDA\nhas said it will consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed and to whom, when determining its intended use. The FDA could disagree with a supplier's assessment that the supplier\u2019s products are ASRs, or when labeled as RUO are actually intended for clinical diagnostic use, and could take enforcement action against the supplier, including requiring the supplier to seek clearance or approval for the products. The supplier may cease selling the products, and we may be unable to obtain an acceptable substitute on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could significantly and adversely affect our ability to provide timely testing results to our customers or could significantly increase our costs of conducting business.\nThe sequencers and reagents supplied to us by Illumina and the blood collection tubes supplied to us by Streck are labeled as RUO in the United States. If the FDA were to require clearance or approval for the sale of Illumina's sequencers and if Illumina does not obtain such clearance or approval, we would have to find an alternative sequencing platform for Panorama. We currently have not validated an alternative sequencing platform that would work for Panorama in a commercially viable manner. If we were not successful in selecting, acquiring on commercially reasonable terms and implementing an alternative platform on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, a decision by the FDA to require clearance or approval for the sale by Streck of the blood collection tubes used for Panorama, or a finding that any of our suppliers failed to comply with applicable requirements, could result in interruptions in our ability to supply our products to the market and adversely affect our operations. Furthermore, if and to the extent that we begin to supply products that are RUO, we would also be subject to the regulatory risks described above.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by international government regulatory and business risks.\nAs we expand our international operations and offer our tests in other countries, we will be increasingly subject to varied and complex foreign and international laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations often involves significant costs and may require changes in our business practices that may result in reduced revenues and profitability. For example, our tests may be subject to the regulatory approval requirements for each foreign country in which they are sold by us or a laboratory partner or licensee, and our future performance would depend on us or our partners or licensees obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner. Regulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, regulatory processes are subject to change, and new or changed regulations can result in unanticipated delays and cost increases. We may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, which may cause us to incur additional costs or prevent us from marketing our tests in foreign countries.\nWe are also subject to the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act which, among other restrictions, prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions. Please see the risk factor entitled \u201cWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\u201d In addition, our international activities are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions, which restrict or otherwise limit our ability to do business in certain designated countries. Other limitations, such as prohibitions on the import into the United States of tissue necessary for us to perform our tests or restrictions on the export of tissue or genetic data imposed by countries outside of the United States, or restrictions on importation and circulation of blood collection tubes or other equipment or supplies by countries outside the United States, may limit our ability to offer our tests internationally in the future.\nOur training and compliance program and our other internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. Non-compliance by us or our employees or agents of these or any other applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or penalties, or adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business.\nOur use of hazardous materials in the development of our tests exposes us to risks related to accidental contamination or injury and requires us to comply with regulations governing hazardous waste materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. In addition, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified hazardous waste materials. An increase in the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a patient intake for Panorama or our other tests is challenged, we could be precluded from billing for such testing or forced to stop performing such tests, which would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAll clinical data and blood samples that we receive are required to have been collected from individuals who have provided appropriate informed consent for us to perform our testing, both commercially and in clinical trials. We seek to ensure that the individuals from whom the data and samples are collected do not retain or have conferred on them any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or any discoveries derived from them. Our partners operate in a number of different countries in addition to the United States, and, to a large extent, we rely upon them to comply with the individual\u2019s informed consent and with U.S. and international laws and regulations. The collection of data and samples in many different countries results in complex legal questions regarding the adequacy of informed consent and the status of genetic material under a large number of different legal systems. The individual's informed consent obtained in any particular country could be challenged in the future, and those informed consents could be deemed invalid, unlawful or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our partners, could deny us access to, or force us to stop testing samples in, a particular country or could call into question the results of our clinical trials. We could also be precluded from billing third-party payers for tests for which informed consents are challenged, or could be requested to refund amounts previously paid by third-party payers for such tests. We could become involved in legal challenges, which could require significant management and financial resources and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nAny failure to obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights and to operate without having third parties infringe, misappropriate or circumvent the rights that we own or license. Our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products or product candidates is dependent upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries. We may be required to file infringement lawsuits to protect our interests, which can be expensive and time consuming. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in proving any such infringement by a third party, and we may become subject to counterclaims by such third parties. Some third-party infringers may have substantially greater resources than us and may be able to sustain the costs of complex infringement litigation more effectively than we can. Even if we prevail in an infringement action, we cannot assure you that we would be fully or partially financially compensated for any harm to our business. We may be forced to enter into a license or other agreement with the infringing third party on terms less profitable or otherwise less commercially acceptable to us than those negotiated between a willing licensee and a willing licensor. Any inability to stop third-party infringement could result in loss in market share of some of our products or even lead to a delay, reduction and/or inhibition of our development, manufacture or sale of some of our products. A product produced and sold by a third-party infringer may not meet our or other regulatory standards or may not be safe for use, which could cause irreparable harm to the reputation of our products, which in turn could result in substantial loss in our market share and profits.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights\noutside of the United States. These challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the United States. In addition, the patent positions of molecular diagnostic companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, and have been and may continue to be affected by developments or uncertainty in the patent statute, patent case law or patent office rules and regulations. Three cases involving diagnostic method claims, \"gene patents,\" and analytical tools have been decided by the Supreme Court in the past few years. The USPTO has issued guidance memoranda on subject matter eligibility analysis of all claims involving the issues addressed in these cases; this guidance is not final, and may change in light of future developments in the case law and in response to public feedback. While this guidance can inform decision-making at the USPTO, federal courts are not bound by this guidance. This uncertainty may materially affect our patents, our ability to obtain patents or the patents and applications of our collaborators and licensors. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that will protect our products or provide us with any competitive advantage.\nOur patent procurement and enforcement positions are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to timely file for patent protection for inventions that are important to our success;\n\u00b7\ncurrent or future patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file such applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority or derivation disputes;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or part or all of the term of certain patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe could inadvertently abandon a patent or patent application, resulting in the loss of protection of certain intellectual property rights in a particular country;\n\u00b7\nthe claims of our issued patents may not cover our products or product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour patents or patent applications may be declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, as a result of either a patent infringement action by us against a competitor with respect to its technology or product or a challenge by a third party in patent litigation or in proceedings before the USPTO or international patent offices;\n\u00b7\nour competitors or others may have filed, and may in the future file, conflicting patent claims covering technology similar or identical to ours. The costs associated with challenging conflicting patent claims could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful and may result in a loss of our patent position and the issuance or validation of the competing claims. Should such competing claims cover our technology, we could be required to obtain rights to those claims at substantial cost;\n\u00b7\nthere may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity of a patent claim. There also may be prior art of which we are aware that we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, but which may nonetheless ultimately be found to do so;\n\u00b7\nthird parties may develop products which have the same or similar effect as our products without infringing our patents. Such third parties may also intentionally circumvent our patents by means of alternate designs or processes or file applications or be granted patents that would block or impede our efforts; and\n\u00b7\ncertain of our intellectual property was partly supported by a U.S. government grant awarded by the National Institutes of Health, and the government accordingly has certain rights in this intellectual property, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use applicable inventions for any\ngovernmental purpose. Such rights also include \"march-in\" rights, which refer to the right of the U.S. government to require us to grant a license to the technology to a responsible applicant if we fail to achieve practical application of the technology or if action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially relevant or competitively advantageous patent protection for our products.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. As a means to enforce our trademark rights and prevent infringement, we may be required to file trademark claims against third parties or initiate trademark opposition proceedings. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming, and we may not be successful. In addition, failure to maintain our trademark registrations, or to obtain new trademark registrations in the future, could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in the countries in which we operate. We may not be able to protect our rights to trademarks and trade names which we may need to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest.\nOur pending trademark applications in the United States and in other foreign jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed or may subsequently be opposed. Even if these applications result in registration of trademarks, third parties may challenge our use or registration of these trademarks in the future. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secret protection and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We have a policy of requiring our consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and our employees to enter into invention, non-disclosure and non-compete agreements. However, we cannot assure you that we have entered into appropriate agreements with all parties that have had access to our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. We also cannot assure you that such agreements will provide for a meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of information, including as a result of breaches of our physical or electronic security systems. Any action to enforce our rights is likely to be time consuming and expensive, and may ultimately be unsuccessful, or may result in a remedy that is not commercially valuable. These risks are heightened in countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States or Europe. Any unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information, whether accidentally or through willful misconduct, could have a material adverse effect on our programs and our strategy, and on our ability to compete effectively.\nThird party claims of intellectual property infringement could result in costly litigation or other proceedings, which would be costly and time-consuming, and could limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of third parties. We operate in a crowded technology area in which multiple third parties own or control potentially relevant intellectual property, including patents, and there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the genetic diagnostics industry. Third parties, including our competitors, may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization or that we are otherwise infringing their intellectual property rights. Defending against infringement claims is costly and may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. If we are unsuccessful in defending against patent infringement claims, we could be forced to pay potentially substantial monetary damages; to obtain licenses from third parties, which we may be unable to do on\nacceptable terms, if at all, and which may require us to make substantial royalty payments; and/or be subjected to an injunction, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell our products, or require us to make changes in our operating procedures that would be costly to implement, and could cause delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products to avoid infringing third party patents or proprietary rights. Any of these or other adverse outcomes could materially and adversely affect our ability to offer our tests, as well as our financial condition and our results of operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are currently involved in patent litigation with Sequenom. An adverse ruling in this proceeding could require us to pay damages (including treble damages), attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, or license fees, any of which could adversely affect our ability to offer Panorama, our ability to continue operations and our financial condition. For more information on our current legal and regulatory proceedings, see \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\" We may also in the future be involved with other litigation or patent office actions with the same or other third parties. We expect that the number of such claims may increase as the number of products and the level of competition in our industry segments grows.\nAs we move into new markets and applications for our products, incumbent participants in such markets may assert their patents and other proprietary rights against us as a means of slowing our entry into such markets or as a means to extract substantial license and royalty payments from us. Our competitors and others may have significantly stronger, larger and/or more mature patent portfolios than we have. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence or protection. Therefore, our commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties.\nIn addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties if we determine it to be in the best interests of our business relationships. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or diagnostic companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or willfully used or disclosed confidential information of our employees' former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims, and if we are unsuccessful, we could be required to pay substantial damages and could lose rights to important intellectual property. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial costs to us and could divert the time and attention of our management and other employees.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may be volatile which could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of life sciences companies, including ours, have been and may continue to be highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as those in this \"Risk Factors\" section and others including:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors' results of operations;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic and commercial partnerships and relationships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nchanges in reimbursement practices by current or potential payers;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new securities analysts' reports or changed recommendations for our stock;\n\u00b7\nperiodic fluctuations in our revenue, due in part to the way in which we recognize revenue;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in regulatory oversight of our products;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our management and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, if the market for life sciences stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. For example, as described further in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, purported securities class action lawsuits have been filed against Natera, our directors and certain of our officers and stockholders. Under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors and officers, and on behalf of our current or former underwriters, in connection with the litigation described in Item 3 and in connection with any future lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Defending against litigation is costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management's attention and resources. Furthermore, during the course of litigation, there could be negative public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we received in our initial public offering and may not use them effectively.\nWe have used and intend to use the net proceeds from our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) for working capital and general corporate purposes and continued investments in research and development for our core technology and development of our product offerings. In addition, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds from our IPO to acquire complementary businesses, technologies or other assets, although we have no present commitments. Accordingly, our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from our IPO. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from our IPO in a manner that does not cause us to become an unregistered investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we have, and will continue to, incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. Our management and other personnel have limited experience managing a public company and preparing public filings. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the Jumpstart Our Businesses Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We hired, and we expect that we will need to continue to hire, additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and may need to establish an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a public company or the timing of such costs. Additional compensation costs and any future equity awards will increase our compensation expense, which would increase our general and administrative expense and could adversely affect our profitability. Also, as a public company it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance on reasonable terms. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our common stock and increased volatility in our stock price.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the end of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO, or December 31, 2020, (ii) in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million and (iii) in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, and (b) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016, provide a management report on internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our management report on internal controls over financial reporting be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm, to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal controls over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing the internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process will be time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or, when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be prohibited or limited by the terms of any current or future debt financing arrangement. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the future, we may issue additional securities or sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We also expect to issue common stock to employees and directors pursuant to our equity incentive plans. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, or common stock is issued pursuant to equity incentive plans, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be adversely affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nInsiders have substantial control over us and will be able to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 50.2% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors may only be removed \"for cause\" and only with the approval of 75% of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15534, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "NTRA"}
