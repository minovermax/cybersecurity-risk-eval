{"cik": "1606745", "company": "Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments. Our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including debt service payments under TripCo\u2019s 0.50% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2051 (the \"Debentures\") and any other indebtedness that we may obtain in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability of Tripadvisor to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on its operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which it may be or may become subject.\nOur holding company structure could restrict access to funds of our subsidiaries that may be needed to service our financial obligations. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and they have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due under our indebtedness. The payment of dividends or the making of loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries, and are subject to various business considerations. Accordingly, our ability to make interest payments on our indebtedness and to otherwise meet our financial obligations at the holding company level is constricted.\nNotwithstanding our ownership interest in Tripadvisor and our having two nominees on its ten member board of directors, we have no ability to cause Tripadvisor to pay dividends or otherwise make funds available to us. We do not have access to the cash that Tripadvisor generates from its operating activities. Tripadvisor generated $108 million, used $194 million and generated $424 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020\nI-12\nand 2019, respectively. Tripadvisor uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Tripadvisor generates unless Tripadvisor declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Other than the special dividend paid in December 2019, Tripadvisor has not historically paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in Tripadvisor\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that Tripadvisor will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness, on acceptable terms. As of December 31, 2021, 187,414 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding and held by Certares (as defined below), with a redemption value, as of December 31, 2021, of approximately $266 million, which we are required to redeem for cash on the earlier of (i) the first business day after March 26, 2025, or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, our change in control. Beginning on March 27, 2024, we have the option, from time to time, to call and repurchase any and all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock for cash. Our cash reserves may be insufficient to satisfy our obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, TripCo had approximately $371 million principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of $330 million outstanding under the Debentures, and $41 million outstanding under the VPF (defined in note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nAlthough Tripadvisor has substantial cash flow from operations, we have limited sources of cash and liquidity. Our cash balance is expected to enable us to fund our parent level operating expenses for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure you that we will not experience unexpected expenses or that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and service our debt and other obligations during the foreseeable future. For additional information about our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\u201d above.\nIn addition, the availability of capital for our company will be subject to prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, all of which are beyond the control of our company. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms, if at all, to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, our company may be unable to complete acquisitions, repurchase equity or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and result in the interests of Certares (as defined below) differing from those of our common stockholders. On March 15, 2020, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) with Certares Holdings LLC, Certares Holdings (Blockable) LLC, and Certares, Holdings (Optional) LLC (collectively, \u201cCertares\u201d). Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we sold Certares 325,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for a purchase price of $1,000 per share. As of December 31, 2021, 187,414 shares of Series A Preferred Stock remained outstanding, which were held by Certares. As a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, Certares is entitled to receive:\n\u25cf dividends, in preference and priority to holders of our common stock, which will accrue on a daily basis at the rate of 8.00% of the liquidation value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The liquidation value of each share of Series A Preferred Stock is equal to the sum of (i) $1,000, plus (ii) all unpaid dividends (whether or not declared)\nI-13\naccrued with respect to such share which pursuant to the terms of the related Certificate of Designations has been added to the liquidation price (the \u201cLiquidation Price\u201d); and\n\u25cf in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment or distribution is made to holders of our common stock, an amount equal to the Liquidation Price for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held plus all unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share.\nAs discussed above, we are required to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash on the earlier of the first business day after March 26, 2025 or, subject to certain exceptions, our change in control, and we have the option, from time to time beginning on March 27, 2024, to call and repurchase any and all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock for cash.\nThese dividend obligations, call right and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain consent rights, including with respect to dividends on or repurchases of our common stock, incurring certain indebtedness, issuing certain stock, entering certain transaction and transferring certain shares of Tripadvisor stock. For so long as at least 25% of the original aggregate liquidation value of the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding (the \u201cThreshold Amount\u201d), we will not pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock (subject to certain exceptions). In addition, for so long as Certares beneficially owns a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value at least equal to the Threshold Amount, we will be required to obtain the prior written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock prior to incurring certain indebtedness, issuing any stock which ranks on a parity basis with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, issuing shares of our Series B common stock, subject to certain exceptions, entering into certain affiliate transactions and transferring shares of Class B common stock and common stock of Tripadvisor. Such consent rights may limit our financial and operational flexibility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or liquidity.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights. We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance such a redemption. We are required to redeem for cash shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the earlier of (i) the first business day after March 26, 2025 or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, our change in control. The \u201cRedemption Price\u201d in a mandatory redemption will equal the greater of (i) the sum of the liquidation value on the redemption date, plus all unpaid dividends accrued since the last dividend date, and (ii) the product of the (x) initial liquidation value, multiplied by (y) an accretion factor (determined based on a formula set forth in the related Certificate of Designations) with respect to the common stock of Tripadvisor, less (z) the aggregate amount of all dividends paid in cash or shares of our Series A or Series C common stock from March 26, 2020 through the applicable redemption date.\nIt is possible that we would not have sufficient funds to make any required redemption of Series A Preferred Stock. Moreover, we may not be able to arrange financing, to pay the redemption price.\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (\u201cLMAC\u201d), which may lead to conflicting interests. As a result of our spin-off from Qurate Retail in 2014 and other transactions between 2011 and 2014 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media and LBC, as well as the initial public offering of LMAC in January 2021, all of our executive officers also serve as executive officers of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and LMAC, and there are overlapping directors. Other than Liberty Media\u2019s ownership of LMAC\u2019s sponsor, which beneficially owns 20% of LMAC\u2019s outstanding common stock as of January 31, 2022, none of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, LMAC or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC or LMAC looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or\nI-14\nthe appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, many of our company\u2019s directors and officers own Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LMAC and/or LBC stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and LMAC. Each of our company, LBC and LMAC has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and their respective restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the respective company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to the respective company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, LMAC and TripCo, as the case may be) instead of the respective company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the respective company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the respective company or as a director or officer of any of the respective company\u2019s subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which the respective company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, LMAC and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, LMAC or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nCertain of our inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Qurate Retail. We entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Qurate Retail for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it provides to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we pay Liberty Media a services fee, and pursuant to an amendment to the services agreement, components of our President and Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation will either be paid directly to him by our company or reimbursed to Liberty Media, in each case, based on the allocation set forth in the amendment. The terms of all of these agreements (other than the amendment to the services agreement relating to Mr. Maffei\u2019s compensation) were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media were at arms\u2019 length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Qurate Retail, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, specifically trademarks, represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had intangible assets not subject to amortization, which consisted of goodwill and trademarks, of approximately $2,950 million, which represented approximately 67% of total assets as of December 31, 2021. These intangible assets were recorded in connection with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Tripadvisor in 2012 and subsequent acquisitions by Tripadvisor. We perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Impairments may result from, among other things, deterioration in financial and operational performance, declines in stock price, increased attrition, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and/or regulations, deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, increased competitive markets in which Tripadvisor operates in, declining financial performance over a sustained period, changes in key personnel and/or strategy, and a variety of other factors.\nDue to deteriorations in revenue, an impairment loss of $288 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, related to trademarks for the hotels, media & platform reporting unit.\nI-15\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor\u2019s future revenue outlook, TripCo recorded a trademark impairment of $250 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying fair value of the trademark approximates its estimated fair value. Further declines in Tripadvisor\u2019s future revenue outlook could result in a decrease in the fair value of the trademark. TripCo will continue to monitor events and circumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying value of its trademark.\nWe previously recorded an impairment loss of $1,271 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to goodwill, related to the legacy hotels reporting unit due to a decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price.\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor\u2019s operating results, which led to a decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price, TripCo recorded a goodwill impairment of $279 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, related to the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment performed during the second quarter and the resulting impairment loss recorded, the carrying value of the Hotels, Media & Platform reporting unit approximates its estimated fair value. Declines in the future revenue outlook, cash flows, or other changes in the business, may necessitate future impairments, which could be material. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if future impairment assessments may be necessary.\nThe amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Any impairment charge relating to goodwill or other intangible assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period. At least annually, or as circumstances arise that may trigger an assessment, we will test our goodwill for impairment. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill will not result in our recognition of additional impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Tripadvisor\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material impact on the travel industry, Tripadvisor and Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused material declines in demand within the travel, hospitality, restaurant and leisure industry that has dampened consumer demand for Tripadvisor\u2019s products and services and has adversely and materially affected its business and financial performance. The extent and duration of the impact of the pandemic on Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the duration and severity of the pandemic is uncertain and cannot be predicted. While many countries are in the process of vaccinating their residents against COVID-19, the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines, adoption rates, as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus may contribute to delays in economic recovery, particularly for the travel industry. Given the unpredictable and unprecedented nature of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the short and long-term impact to Tripadvisor\u2019s future financial performance, but Tripadvisor expects the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects to continue to have a significant adverse impact on its business and financial performance for the foreseeable future.\nFurther, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of Tripadvisor\u2019s work force began working remotely and continue to work remotely. While many of Tripadvisor\u2019s employees are accustomed to working remotely or working with other remote employees, much of its workforce has historically not been remote. Working remotely can give rise to cybersecurity issues, training and compliance issues, or create operational or other challenges as Tripadvisor adjusts to a fully-remote workforce, any of which could harm its business.\nDeclines or disruptions in the travel industry have had a material adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance. Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry. As noted above, Tripadvisor expects that COVID-19 will continue to materially adversely impact its business into 2022. Other events beyond Tripadvisor\u2019s control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, travel-related health concerns, restrictions related to travel, trade or immigration policies, wars, sources of political uncertainty, foreign policy changes, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, labor unrest or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel globally or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. In addition,\nI-16\nthe uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends, which in turn could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to effectively manage its business. Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance is also subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Sales of travel services tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or economic weakness, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. Leisure travel, in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of Tripadvisor\u2019s current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels.\nIf Tripadvisor is unable to continue to attract a significant amount of visitors to its platform, to cost-effectively convert these visitors into revenue-generating customers and to continue to engage consumers, its business and financial performance could be harmed. Tripadvisor\u2019s traffic and user engagement could be adversely affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, inability to provide quality content, inventory or supply to its consumers; declines or inefficiencies in traffic acquisition and reduced awareness of its brands. Certain of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors have advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive traffic directly to their websites, and these campaigns may negatively impact traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform. There can be no assurances that Tripadvisor will continue to provide content and products in a manner that meets rapidly changing demand. Any failure to obtain and manage content and products in a cost-effective manner that will engage consumers, or any failure to provide content and products that are perceived as useful, reliable and trustworthy, could adversely affect user experiences and their repeat behavior, reduce traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform and negatively impact its business and financial performance.\nTripadvisor relies on internet search engines and application marketplaces to drive traffic to its platform, certain providers of which offer products and services that compete directly with Tripadvisor\u2019s. If Tripadvisor is unable to drive traffic cost-effectively, traffic to its platform could decline and its business would be negatively affected. The number of consumers Tripadvisor attracts to its platform is due in large part to how and where information from, and links to, its platform are displayed on search engine results pages, or SERPs. The display, including rankings, of search results can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in Tripadvisor\u2019s control. Search engines frequently change the logic that determines the placement and display of the results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform can be negatively affected. A search engine could alter its search algorithms or results causing Tripadvisor\u2019s websites to place lower in search query results. For example, Google, a significant source of traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform, frequently promotes its own competing products in its search results, which has negatively impacted placement of references to Tripadvisor and its platform on the SERP. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of Tripadvisor\u2019s websites or those of its travel partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the cost or effectiveness of Search Engine Optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) or Search Engine Marketing (\u201cSEM\u201d) in a negative manner, Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance would be adversely affected. Furthermore, Tripadvisor\u2019s failure to successfully manage its SEO and SEM strategies and/or other traffic acquisition strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform, as well as increased costs to the extent it replaces free traffic with paid traffic.\nTripadvisor also relies on application marketplaces, or app stores such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, to drive downloads of its apps. In the future, Apple, Google or other marketplace operators may make changes that make access to Tripadvisor\u2019s products more difficult or may limit Tripadvisor\u2019s access to information that would restrict its ability to provide the best user experience. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight metasearch product and hotel metasearch product as well as reservation functionality. Tripadvisor\u2019s apps may receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing apps, such as the order in which they appear within marketplaces. In addition, Apple has announced new features that limit who has access to consumer data, including location information. Similarly, if problems arise in Tripadvisor\u2019s relationships with providers of application marketplaces, traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform and its user growth could be harmed.\nI-17\nTripadvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and any significant reduction in spending by advertisers on its platform could harm its business. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to grow advertising revenue with its existing or new travel partners is dependent in large part on its ability to provide value to them relative to other alternatives. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to provide value to its travel partners depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to increase or maintain user engagement;\n\u25cf Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to increase or maintain the quantity and quality of ads shown to consumers;\n\u25cf The development of technologies that can block the display of Tripadvisor\u2019s ads or its ad measurement tools;\n\u25cf The effectiveness of Tripadvisor\u2019s advertising and the extent to which it generates sales leads, customers, bookings or financial results on a cost-effective basis;\n\u25cf The competitiveness of Tripadvisor\u2019s products, traffic quality, perception of its platform, and availability and accuracy of analytics and measurement solutions to demonstrate its value; and\n\u25cf Adverse government actions or legal developments relating to advertising, including limitations on Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to deliver targeted advertising.\nAny of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for Tripadvisor\u2019s ads, which may reduce the prices it receive for its ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with Tripadvisor altogether, any of which would negatively affect its revenue and financial results.\nClick-based advertising revenue accounts for the majority of Tripadvisor\u2019s advertising revenue. Tripadvisor pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. If Tripadvisor\u2019s large advertisers become less competitive with each other, merge with each other or with Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors, focus more on per-click profit than on traffic volume, or are able to reduce CPCs, this could have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s advertising revenue which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on its business and financial results.\nTripadvisor relies on a relatively small number of significant travel partners and any reduction in spending by or loss of these partners could seriously harm its business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Tripadvisor\u2019s two most significant travel partners, Expedia and Booking (and their subsidiaries), accounted for a combined 34% of total revenue. If any of Tripadvisor\u2019s significant travel partners were to cease or significantly curtail advertising on its platform, Tripadvisor could experience a rapid decline in its revenue over a relatively short period of time which would have a material impact on its business.\nTripadvisor\u2019s business depends on strong brands and any failure to maintain, protect or enhance its brands could hurt its ability to retain and expand its base of consumers and partners, the frequency with which consumers utilize its products and services and its ability to attract travel partners. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to maintain and protect its brands depends, in part, on its ability to maintain consumer trust in its products and services and in the quality, integrity, reliability of usefulness of the content and other information found on its platform. If consumers do not view the content on Tripadvisor\u2019s platform to be useful and reliable, they may seek other sources to obtain the information they are looking for and may not return to its platform as often or at all. Tripadvisor dedicates significant resources to protecting the quality of its content, primarily through its content guidelines, computer algorithms and human moderators that are focused on identifying and removing inappropriate, unreliable or deceptive content.\nMedia, legal, or regulatory scrutiny of Tripadvisor\u2019s user content, advertising practices, and other issues may adversely affect its reputation and brand. Negative publicity about Tripadvisor, including its content, technology and business practices, could diminish its reputation and confidence in its brand, thereby negatively affecting the use of its products and its financial performance. For example, in the past, certain media outlets have alleged that Tripadvisor has improperly filtered or screened reviews, that it has not properly verified reviews, or that it manipulates reviews, ranking and ratings in favor of its advertisers. Tripadvisor expends significant resources to ensure the integrity of its reviews and to ensure that the most relevant reviews are available to its consumers; Tripadvisor does not establish rankings and ratings in favor of its advertisers. Regulatory inquiries or investigations require management time and attention and could result in further negative publicity, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes.\nI-18\nIn addition, unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, Tripadvisor\u2019s practices relating to privacy and data protection could adversely affect its reputation with its consumers and its travel partners. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of Tripadvisor\u2019s user base and result in decreased revenue.\nConsumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges. If Tripadvisor is unable to offer compelling products on such devices or continue to operate effectively on these platforms, its business may be adversely affected. Widespread adoption of mobile devices has driven substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms and Tripadvisor anticipate that use of these devices will continue to grow. Tripadvisor\u2019s platform, when utilized on mobile phone devices, have historically monetized at a significantly lower rate than desktops and advertising opportunities are more limited on these devices. Additionally, consumer purchasing patterns differ on these devices. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device are generally for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Tripadvisor expects that the ways in which consumers engage with its platform will continue to change over time as consumers increasingly engage via alternative devices.\nIt is important for Tripadvisor to develop and maintain effective platforms to drive adoption and user engagement by providing consumers with an appealing, easy-to-use experience. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems Tripadvisor may encounter in adapting its products and services and it may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of competitive new products. If Tripadvisor is unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create appealing, user-friendly and differentiated offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise on these platforms, it could lose market share and its business, future growth and financial results could be adversely affected.\nTripadvisor\u2019s success will also depend on the interoperability of its products with a range of technologies, systems, networks and standards and its ability to create, maintain and develop relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which may be its competitors. For example, Google\u2019s Android, and Apple\u2019s iPhone are the leading smartphones in the world and Tripadvisor\u2019s products need to synergistically function on their operating systems in order to create a positive user experience on those devices. Yet, Apple has announced privacy features that may limit the amount of information Tripadvisor can access about its users operating on the Apple iPhone operating system.\nTripadvisor may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks and standards or in creating, maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in related industries. If Tripadvisor experiences difficulties or increased costs in integrating its products into alternative devices or if manufacturers do not include its products in their devices, make changes that degrade the functionality of its products, give preferential treatment to competitive products or prevent Tripadvisor from delivering advertising, its user growth and financial results may be harmed.\nAny continued or future declines or disruptions in the economy and industries in which Tripadvisor operates could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s businesses, financial performance and the market price of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock and our common stock. Sales of travel services tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or economic weakness, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. The global economy may be adversely impacted by events beyond Tripadvisor\u2019s control including actual or threatened terrorism, regional hostilities or instability, natural disasters, political instability and health concerns (including epidemics or pandemics), significant increases in energy costs, tightening of credit markets and declines in consumer confidence. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect its ability to effectively manage its business.\nEconomic downturn and adverse market conditions may also negatively impact Tripadvisor\u2019s travel partners, its travel partners\u2019 access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs. These challenges faced in a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the travel industry could adversely impact Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial performance and share price. The extent and duration of such impacts remain largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time.\nI-19\nTripadvisor operates in a competitive global environment and its failure to compete effectively could reduce its market share and harm its financial performance. Tripadvisor competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies where it operates, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. Tripadvisor faces competition for content, consumers, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services and online reservations. Tripadvisor competes globally with both online and offline, established and emerging, providers of travel, lodging, experiences and restaurant reservation and related services. Current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. More specifically:\n\u25cf In Tripadvisor\u2019s Hotels, Media & Platform segment, it faces competition from the following businesses: OTAs (including Expedia and Booking); hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, Kayak, HotelsCombined, and Trip.com); large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba and Airbnb); and traditional offline travel agencies; and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.\n\u25cf Tripadvisor also faces competition from different companies with respect to its Experiences & Dining segment. Its Experiences offering competes with online travel agencies, such as Airbnb, Booking, GetYourGuide, Peek and Klook; traditional travel agencies; online travel service providers; and wholesalers, among others. Its Dining offering competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Google and OpenTable.\nThere has been a proliferation of new channels through which service providers can offer accommodations, experiences and restaurant reservations. Metasearch services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant\u2019s brand to drive consumers directly to its website. Some of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors offer a variety of online services and, in some cases, are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share. Many of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and have more expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic as well as larger client bases. They also have the ability to leverage other aspects of their business to enable them to compete more effectively.\nIn addition, Google and other large, established companies with substantial resources and expertise have launched travel or travel-related search, metasearch and/or reservation booking services and may create additional inroads into online travel. Many of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in travel.\nTripadvisor competes with certain companies that it also does business with, including certain of its travel partners and related parties. The consolidation of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors and travel partners may affect its relative competitiveness and its travel partner relationships. Competition and consolidation could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on its advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to its platform and reduced advertising by travel companies on its platform.\nTripadvisor relies on information technology to operate its business and remain competitive, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm its businesses. Tripadvisor\u2019s future success depends on its ability to continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while at the same time maintaining the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. Tripadvisor may not be able to maintain or replace its existing systems or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost-effective manner. Tripadvisor may not be successful, or as successful as its competitors, in developing technologies and systems that operate effectively across multiple devices and platforms in a way that is appealing to its consumers. Tripadvisor\u2019s future success will also depend on its ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization; new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies; new and emerging payment methods, such as cryptocurrencies, Alipay, Paytm and WeChat Pay; artificial intelligence; virtual and augmented reality; and cloud technologies. The emergence of alternative or new devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require additional investment in technology. New developments in other areas could also make it easier for competitors to enter its markets due to lower up-front technology costs.\nI-20\nIf Tripadvisor is unable to adapt to the evolving demands of its customers, it may not remain competitive, and its business and financial performance could suffer. Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors are continually developing innovations in services and features. As a result, Tripadvisor is continually working to improve the user experience on its platform in order to engage its consumers and drive user traffic and conversion rates for its travel partners and provide its business partners with the tools they need to succeed. Tripadvisor has invested, and expects to continue to invest, significant resources in developing and marketing these innovations. Tripadvisor can give no assurances that the changes it makes will yield the benefits it expects and will not have unintended or adverse impacts. If Tripadvisor is unable to continue offering innovative products and services and quality features that customers want to use, existing customers may become dissatisfied and use competitors\u2019 offerings and Tripadvisor may be unable to attract additional customers, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nTripadvisor\u2019s dedication to making the consumer experience its highest priority may cause it to prioritize rapid innovation and consumer experience over short-term financial results. Tripadvisor strives to create the best experience for its consumers. Tripadvisor believes that in doing so it will increase its traffic conversion (i.e., visitors converting into clicks and/or bookings), revenue and financial performance. Tripadvisor has taken actions in the past, and may continue to take actions in the future, that have the effect of reducing its short-term financial results if it believes the actions benefit the overall consumer experience. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits Tripadvisor expects, new or enhanced products may fail to engage consumers and/or Tripadvisor may be unsuccessful in its efforts to monetize these initiatives, in which case its relationships with consumers and travel partners, and its business and financial performance could be harmed.\nTripadvisor is dependent upon the quality of traffic in its network to provide value to its travel partners, and any failure in its ability to deliver quality traffic and/or the metrics to demonstrate the value of the traffic could have a material and adverse impact on the value of its platform to its travel partners and adversely affect its revenue. Tripadvisor uses technology and processes to monitor the quality of the internet traffic that it delivers to its travel partners and has identified metrics to demonstrate the quality of that traffic and identify low quality clicks such as non-human processes, including robots, spiders, the mechanical automation of clicking and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. Even with such monitoring in place, there is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic will be delivered to such online advertisers. Such low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to Tripadvisor\u2019s relationships with travel partners and could adversely affect its advertising pricing and revenue.\nTripadvisor relies on assumptions and estimates and data to calculate certain of its key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm its reputation and negatively affect its business. Certain metrics are key to Tripadvisor\u2019s business; as both the industry in which it operates and its businesses continue to evolve, so too might the metrics by which it evaluates its businesses. While the calculation of the metrics Tripadvisor uses is based on what it believes to be reasonable estimates, its internal tools are not independently verified by a third-party and have a number of limitations; furthermore, its methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time. For example, a single person may have multiple accounts or browse the internet on multiple browsers or devices, some consumers may restrict Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to accurately identify them across visits, some mobile apps automatically contact its servers for regular updates with no user action, and Tripadvisor is not always able to capture user information on its platform. As such, the calculations of its unique users may not accurately reflect the number of people actually visiting its platform. If the internal tools Tripadvisor uses to track these metrics under-count or over-count performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data it reports may not be accurate. Tripadvisor continues to improve upon its tools and methodologies to capture data; however, the improvement of its tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data, which could confuse investors or lead to questions about the integrity of its data. Finally, Tripadvisor may, in the future, identify new or other metrics that enable it to more accurately evaluate its business. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these metrics.\nTripadvisor relies on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if it is unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel its business would be harmed. The contributions of key senior management and the contributions of software engineers and other technology professionals are critical to Tripadvisor\u2019s overall management and the success of its business. Tripadvisor cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of\nI-21\nits existing key personnel and the loss of one or more of its key personnel, without a suitable replacement, could seriously harm its business. Tripadvisor does not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nStephen Kaufer, Tripadvisor\u2019s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, is expected to step down from his position in 2022. While Tripadvisor\u2019s board has initiated an open search for Mr. Kaufer\u2019s position, a successor has not yet been named. Tripadvisor cannot ensure that it will be able to find a suitable replacement for Mr. Kaufer on the expected timeline. Moreover, leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition to a permanent successor may cause disruptions to Tripadvisor\u2019s business due to, among other things, diverting management's attention or causing a deterioration in morale. Additionally, the ability of a new CEO to quickly expand their knowledge of Tripadvisor\u2019s business plans, operations and strategies will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about strategy and operations. Further, if Tripadvisor\u2019s new CEO formulates different or changed views, the future strategy and plans of Tripadvisor may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe success of Tripadvisor\u2019s operations and the quality of its services are also highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. During 2020, Tripadvisor\u2019s headcount was reduced by nearly 1,600 employees. During 2021, Tripadvisor saw historic levels of attrition. This reduction in workforce and attrition results in the loss of institutional knowledge, relationships, or expertise for critical roles. This could also have a negative impact on employee morale and productivity, make it more difficult to retain valuable key employees, divert attention from operating Tripadvisor\u2019s business, create personnel capacity constraints and hamper its ability to grow, develop innovative products and compete, any of which could impede its ability to operate or meet strategic objectives. For employees, Tripadvisor competes with companies that have far greater financial resources than it does as well as companies that promise short-term growth opportunities and/or other benefits. If Tripadvisor does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, investments, significant commercial arrangements and/or new business strategies could present new challenges and risks and disrupt its ongoing business. Tripadvisor has acquired, invested in and/or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments, commercial arrangements and/or changes in business strategies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Costs incurred to identify, pursue and fund these endeavors that may or may not be successful and may limit other potential uses of cash;\n\u25cf Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from Tripadvisor\u2019s existing business;\n\u25cf Difficulties and expenses in integrating the operations, products, technology or personnel;\n\u25cf Difficulties in implementing and retaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u25cf Assumption of debt and liabilities, including costs associated with litigation, cybersecurity risks, and other claims;\n\u25cf Failure of any such strategy or target to achieve anticipated objectives, revenue or earnings;\n\u25cf Limited management or operational control and heightened reputational risk with respect to minority investments;\n\u25cf Entrance into markets in which Tripadvisor has no prior experience; and\n\u25cf Adverse market reaction to the transaction.\nTripadvisor has in the past invested, and may in the future invest, in privately-held companies. Such investments are inherently risky and its ability to liquidate any such investments is typically difficult. Valuations of such privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for the companies\u2019 securities. Tripadvisor cannot assure you that these investments will be successful or that such endeavors will result in the realization of the synergies, cost savings and innovation that may be possible within a reasonable period of time, if at all. Tripadvisor could lose the full amount of its investments; any impairment of its investments could have a material adverse effect on its financial results.\nI-22\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nTripadvisor is a global company that operates in many different jurisdictions inside and outside the U.S. and these operations expose Tripadvisor to additional risks. Many regions have different economic conditions, languages, currencies, legislation, regulatory environments, levels of political stability, levels of consumer expectations, and use of the internet for commerce. Tripadvisor is subject to risks typical of global businesses, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nCompliance with additional laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations regarding data privacy, labor and employment, advertising, anti-competition and tax;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in managing staff and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf\nRestrictions on repatriation of cash and on investments in operations;\n\u25cf\nUncertainty regarding liability for services, content and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nIncreased risk and limits on enforceability of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nDiminished ability to legally enforce contractual rights;\n\u25cf\nEconomic or political instability or laws involving economic or trade prohibitions or sanctions; and\n\u25cf\nThreatened or actual acts of terrorism.\nTripadvisor\u2019s strategy includes continued expansion in existing markets and potentially new markets. In addition to the risks mentioned above, international markets have strong local competitors with established brands and travel service providers or relationships that may make expansion in certain markets difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated. In some markets, legal and other regulatory requirements may prohibit or limit participation by foreign businesses, such as by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel-related businesses illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those markets uneconomic, which could make Tripadvisor\u2019s entry or expansion in those markets difficult or impossible, require that it work with a local partner or result in higher operating costs. If Tripadvisor is unsuccessful in expanding in existing and potentially new markets and effectively managing that expansion, its business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nTripadvisor is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings which may result in adverse outcomes and, regardless of the outcome, result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, injunctions or damage awards, and other negative results. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, fines or penalties that could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial results or financial position. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions or consent decrees, the release of confidential information or orders preventing Tripadvisor from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in its business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial results.\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business or financial results. Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to Tripadvisor and its business, including, but not limited to, those relating to internet and online commerce, internet advertising, consumer protection, intermediary liability and data security and privacy. These laws continue to evolve. For example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to internet and online commerce and liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet. In addition, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, data privacy and industry-specific laws and regulations. Further, Tripadvisor\u2019s Rentals business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments globally that affect the rental industry, such as (i) statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit property owners and managers from renting certain properties on a short-term basis, (ii) fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, and (iii) homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations adopting or considering adopting rules that prohibit or restrict property owners and managers from short-term rentals. Operating in this dynamic regulatory environment requires significant management attention and financial resources. The failure of Tripadvisor\u2019s businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental\nI-23\nagencies, regulatory authorities, courts and/or consumers, which, if material, could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations, could require Tripadvisor to change certain aspects of its business, operations and relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject Tripadvisor to additional liabilities. For example, many jurisdictions have adopted, and many jurisdictions are considering adopting, privacy rights and consumer protections for their residents, which legislation will continue to change the landscape for the use and protection of data and could increase the cost and complexity of delivering Tripadvisor\u2019s services. Unfavorable changes could limit marketing methods and capabilities, decrease demand for products and services, impede development of new products, require significant management time, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in penalties, criminal sanctions and/or negative publicity against Tripadvisor, its officers or its employees and/or restrictions on the conduct of its business.\nTripadvisor faces risks related to its intellectual property. Tripadvisor relies on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. Tripadvisor protects its content, brands and technology by, among other things, a combination of maintenance and enforcement of registered and unregistered intellectual property rights (e.g. trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets), technological solutions and contractual protections. Even with these precautions, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use its intellectual property, without authorization or to independently develop similar content, brands or technology. Any misappropriation or violation of Tripadvisor\u2019s rights could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nEffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which Tripadvisor\u2019s platform or services are made available and policing unauthorized use of Tripadvisor\u2019s intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Tripadvisor may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use. Tripadvisor cannot be sure that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of its intellectual property. Furthermore, Tripadvisor may need to go to court or other tribunals in order to enforce its rights or scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and Tripadvisor cannot accurately predict the likelihood of success in such proceedings. Tripadvisor\u2019s failure to protect its intellectual property in an effective manner could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nTripadvisor currently licenses some of the intellectual property displayed on its platform from third parties. As Tripadvisor continues to introduce new services that incorporate new intellectual property, it may be required or elect to license additional intellectual property. Tripadvisor cannot be sure that such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of Tripadvisor\u2019s business, it has been subject to, and is currently subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to third-party intellectual property rights, and Tripadvisor expects that third-parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against it, particularly as it expands the complexity and scope of its platform and services. Successful intellectual property claims against Tripadvisor could result in significant monetary liability or prevent it from operating its business, or portions of its business, or require it to change business practices or develop non-infringing intellectual property, which could require significant effort and expense. In addition, resolution of claims may require Tripadvisor to obtain releases or licenses to use intellectual property rights belonging to third-parties, which may be expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Data Security and Privacy\nTripadvisor\u2019s processing, storage and use of personal information and other data subjects it to additional laws and regulations and failure to comply with those laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities. The security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and service provider confidence in Tripadvisor\u2019s services. Tripadvisor is subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, the scope of which are changing, subject to\nI-24\ndiffering interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other existing laws. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In addition, practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny.\nImplementing and complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than Tripadvisor anticipates, or could otherwise affect its operations. Any failure or perceived failure by Tripadvisor to comply with its privacy and information security policies, privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, may result in litigation or governmental enforcement actions that could harm its reputation and cause its consumers and travel partners to lose trust in Tripadvisor, any of which could have an adverse effect on its business, brand, market share and financial results.\nTripadvisor is subject to risks associated with processing credit card and other payment transactions and failure to manage those risks may subject it to fines, penalties and additional costs and could have a negative impact on its business. Tripadvisor accepts payments from consumers and travel partners using a variety of methods, including credit, debit and invoicing. Tripadvisor is subject to regulations and compliance requirements, including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes. Tripadvisor relies on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services and its business could be disrupted if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to it. Tripadvisor is also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for it to comply. Tripadvisor is also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers and privacy and information security. These laws, regulations and/or requirements result in significant costs and, yet, Tripadvisor may still be susceptible to fraudulent activity or cyber-threats. If Tripadvisor fails to comply with these rules or requirements or if its data security systems are breached or compromised, it may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines, penalties and higher transaction fees, and/or lose its ability to accept credit and debit card payments, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments. In addition, for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, Tripadvisor pays interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise its operating costs and lower profitability.\nAdditionally, Tripadvisor\u2019s marketplace activities in the U.K. and Europe require it to obtain a payment institution license under the Second Payment Services Directive (\u201cPSD2\u201d) which replaced the Payment Services Directive (\u201cPSD\u201d) effective January 13, 2018. PSD2 requires a license to perform certain defined \u201cpayment services\u201d in a European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) member state. Conditions for obtaining the license include minimum capital requirements, establishment of procedures for safeguarding of funds, and certain governance and reporting requirements. Certain obligations relating to internal controls and the conduct of business, in particular, consumer disclosure requirements and certain rules regarding the timing and settlement of payments, must be met.\nIt is possible that Tripadvisor could become subject to regulatory enforcement or other proceedings in those states or other jurisdictions with money transmission, or other similar statutes or regulatory requirements, including an EEA member state, related to the handling or moving of money, which could in turn have a significant impact on its business, even if it were to ultimately prevail in such proceedings. If Tripadvisor is ultimately deemed to be in violation of one or more money transmitter or other similar statutes or regulatory requirements related to the handling or moving of money in the U.S., the EEA or other jurisdictions, Tripadvisor may be subject to the imposition of fines or restrictions on its business, its ability to offer some or all of its services in the relevant jurisdiction may be suspended, and it may be subject to civil or criminal liability and its business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nSystem security issues, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and system outage issues could disrupt Tripadvisor\u2019s operations or services provided to its consumers, and any such disruption could damage its reputation and adversely affect its business, financial results and share price. Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation and ability to attract, retain and service its consumers and travel partners is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of its computer systems and those of third-parties Tripadvisor utilizes in its operations. Significant security issues, data breaches, cyberattacks and outages, interruptions or delays, in Tripadvisor\u2019s systems or third-party systems upon which it relies, could impair Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to display content or process transactions and significantly harm its business. Breaches of Tripadvisor\u2019s security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of\nI-25\nproprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about Tripadvisor, its consumers or its travel partners, could expose Tripadvisor, its consumers and travel partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, damage its brand and reputation or otherwise harm its business and financial performance and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for Tripadvisor. The costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. In addition, to the extent that Tripadvisor does experience a data breach, remediation may be costly and it may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs.\nComputer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack Tripadvisor\u2019s products or otherwise exploit any vulnerabilities in its systems, or attempt to fraudulently induce its employees, consumers, or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to its systems or data. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that Tripadvisor produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. Tripadvisor may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to investigate and address problems caused by cyber or other security problems. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for Tripadvisor\u2019s own systems or systems of vendors, could expose it to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on its financial performance.\nMuch of Tripadvisor\u2019s business is conducted with third-party partners and vendors. A security breach at such third-party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of its systems and could result in negative publicity or reputational damage, expose it to risk of loss or litigation and subject it to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such incidents may also result in a decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s user base and client base or engagement levels.\nMedia coverage of data breaches and public exposure of consumer data rights has increased, in part because of the rise of enforcement actions, investigations and lawsuits. Similarly, the increase in privacy activist groups is likely to give rise to further scrutiny, investigative actions and publicity. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions. As this focus and attention on privacy and data protection increases, Tripadvisor also risks exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from the compliance with, or any failure to comply with, applicable legal requirements, conflicts among these legal requirements or differences in approaches to privacy and security. Security breaches could also cause travelers and consumers to lose confidence in Tripadvisor\u2019s data security, which would have a negative effect on the value of its brand.\nEvolving regulations, guidance and practices on the use of \"cookies\" and similar technology could negatively impact the way Tripadvisor does business. Cookies, or text files stored on consumers\u2019 web browsers, are common tools used by thousands of websites and apps, including Tripadvisor\u2019s, to store or gather information, improve site security, improve the customer experience, market to consumers and increase conversion on their websites. Many countries have adopted data protection laws and regulations governing the use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies by websites and app developers. Such regulations could limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to serve certain customers in the manner it currently does, including with respect to retargeting or personalized advertising, impair its ability to improve and optimize performance on its platform, negatively affect a consumer's experience using its platform and negatively impact its business. Equally, privacy has been the impetus behind a move towards a cookie-less online ecosystem which poses a potential risk to its online behavioral advertising strategy. For example, Apple and Google continue to announce new privacy features that may limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to use cookies and similar technology to improve the consumer experience.\nI-26\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nTripadvisor has indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. With respect to the 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Convertible Senior Notes (as defined in note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), Tripadvisor is subject to risks relating to its existing or potential indebtedness that include:\n\u25cf Requirement to dedicate a portion of its cash flow to principal and interest payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf Difficulties to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u25cf Possible competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u25cf Limitations on its ability to borrow additional funds on acceptable terms or at all; and\n\u25cf Exposure to increased interest rates to the extent its outstanding debt is subject to variable rates of interest.\nFailure to comply with the various covenants contained in Tripadvisor\u2019s Credit Agreement and the 2025 Indenture could have a material adverse effect on its business. The various covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and 2025 Indenture (as defined in note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) include those that limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf Incur indebtedness;\n\u25cf Pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock;\n\u25cf Effect share repurchases;\n\u25cf Enter into secured financing arrangements;\n\u25cf Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u25cf Enter into unrelated businesses.\nThese covenants may limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to optimally operate its business. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the Credit Facility or the 2025 Senior Notes and 2026 Convertible Senior Notes may result in an event of default under the agreements governing such debt instruments and such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. In addition, lenders under the Credit Facility may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply Tripadvisor with further funds.\nTripadvisor may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, Tripadvisor agreed to pledge substantially all of its assets, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries. This agreement also includes restrictive covenants that may limit its ability to secure additional financing in the future on favorable terms, if at all. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to secure additional financing will also depend upon its future operating performance, which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond its control.\nTripadvisor is subject to risks relating to its 2026 Convertible Senior Notes. During the first quarter of 2021, Tripadvisor and TripCo adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. The new accounting guidance requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new accounting guidance, among other things, requires an entity to use the if-converted method in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the notes were exchanged solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce Tripadvisor\u2019s reported diluted earnings per share, if any.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the conversion of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes is satisfied, then Tripadvisor may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no\nI-27\nnoteholders exchange their 2026 Convertible Senior Notes and could materially reduce Tripadvisor\u2019s reported working capital.\nHolders of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes may convert the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes after the occurrence of certain dates or events. Refer to note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes. Settlement of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s liquidity.\nTripadvisor is subject to risks relating to the Capped Calls. In connection with the issuance of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes, Tripadvisor entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d) to reduce potential dilution to its common stock and/or offset cash payments Tripadvisor must make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any conversion of senior notes, with such offset subject to a cap. Tripadvisor is subject to the risk that one or more of the hedge counterparties may default under the Capped Calls. If any of the hedge counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, Tripadvisor will become an unsecured creditor with a claim equal to its exposure at that time under its transactions with such counterparties. Tripadvisor\u2019s exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in its exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, Tripadvisor may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than it currently anticipates with respect to its common stock.\nTripadvisor\u2019s financial results are difficult to forecast; they have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate in the future. Tripadvisor\u2019s financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which it is unable to predict or are outside of its control, including:\n\u25cf Its ability to maintain and grow its consumer base and to increase user engagement;\n\u25cf Increases in marketing, sales and other expenses that it will incur to grow and expand its operations and to remain competitive;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in the marketing spend of its travel partners due to seasonality, global or regional events or other factors;\n\u25cf User behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that it successfully monetizes;\n\u25cf System failure or outages, which would prevent it from serving ads for any period of time;\n\u25cf Breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\n\u25cf Fees paid to third parties for content or promotion of its products and services;\n\u25cf Adverse litigation judgments, settlement or other litigation related costs;\n\u25cf Changes in the legislative or regulatory environment or engagement by regulators;\n\u25cf Changes in tax laws, which may significantly affect its tax rates and taxes due;\n\u25cf Tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations that may materially differ from the amounts it has anticipated;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of its revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u25cf Changes in U.S. GAAP; and\n\u25cf Changes in global business and macroeconomic conditions.\nAs a result, you should not rely upon Tripadvisor\u2019s quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance.\nRisks Related to Tax Matters\nTripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on its financial results and could increase the volatility of those results. Due to the global nature of Tripadvisor\u2019s business, it is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. In the event Tripadvisor incurs taxable income in certain jurisdictions but incurs losses in other jurisdictions, it generally cannot offset the income from one jurisdiction with the loss from another. This lack of flexibility could affect its effective income tax rate. Furthermore, significant judgment is required to calculate its worldwide provision for income taxes and depends on its ability to operate\nI-28\nits business in a manner consistent with its corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. In the ordinary course of Tripadvisor\u2019s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nTripadvisor\u2019s future income tax rates could be affected by a number of matters outside of its control, including but not limited to changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or accounting for share-based compensation. If Tripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rates were to increase, its financial results and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nApplication of U.S. state and local or international tax laws, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of Tripadvisor\u2019s tax positions, could materially affect its financial position and results of operations. As an international business, Tripadvisor is subject to income taxes and non-income-based taxes in the U.S. and various other international jurisdictions. Tax laws are subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates and tax regimes may be subject to significant change and the tax benefits that Tripadvisor intends to eventually derive could be undermined due to changing tax laws. Governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenue, which has contributed to more aggressive positions taken by tax authorities and an increase in tax legislation. Any such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of Tripadvisor\u2019s current tax provisions or may require it to modify its business practices in order to reduce its exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Any changes to international tax laws or any additional reporting requirements may increase the complexity and costs associated with tax compliance and adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project and has issued various reports, guidelines, policy notes, and proposals that if adopted could result in an overhaul of the international taxation system under which Tripadvisor\u2019s current tax obligations are determined. In October 2021, more than 130 countries tentatively signed on to a framework, expected to be implemented in 2023, which calls for a minimum tax rate on corporations of 15% and a reallocation of profits from the largest and most profitable businesses to countries where they make sales. The proposed framework, once enacted, envisages new international tax rules and the removal of all digital services taxes. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on Tripadvisor\u2019s tax obligations is uncertain. As the OECD/G20 continues to drive toward a consensus framework, several countries which have previously enacted unilateral digital services tax initiatives, such as France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K., will continue to impose these revenue based taxes until implementation of the consensus framework. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Tripadvisor recorded $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of digital service tax to general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nTripadvisor is routinely under audit by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The ultimate outcome of these examinations (including the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit described below) cannot be predicted with certainty but could be materially different from its income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material effect on its results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Should the IRS or other taxing authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations, Tripadvisor may be required to record charges to its results of operations, which could harm its operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of Tripadvisor\u2019s platform and its financial results. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce and it is possible that various jurisdictions may attempt to levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to its activities. For example, Congress is considering various approaches to legislation that would require companies engaged in e-commerce to collect sales tax on internet revenue and a growing number of U.S. states and certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposals to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., in which a Court reversed longstanding precedent that remote sellers are not required to collect state and local sales taxes, may have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s business. Also, as described in more detail above, certain U.S. states and countries in which Tripadvisor does business have enacted or proposed digital services tax initiatives. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject Tripadvisor or its customers to additional sales, occupancy, income and\nI-29\nother taxes. Tripadvisor cannot predict the effect of these and other attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce; however, new or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, occupancy taxes, value added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d), and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products and services over the internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial results and financial condition.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that Tripadvisor should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, occupancy, VAT or similar taxes, and Tripadvisor could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect its operating results. Tripadvisor does not collect and remit sales and use, occupancy, VAT or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which it has sales, based on its belief that such taxes are not applicable or legally required. Several states and other taxing jurisdictions have presented or threatened Tripadvisor with assessments, alleging that it is required to collect and remit certain taxes there. While Tripadvisor does not believe that it is subject to such taxes and intends to vigorously defend its position in these cases, it cannot be sure of the outcome of its discussions and/or appeals with these states. In the event of an adverse outcome, Tripadvisor could face assessments, plus any additional interest and penalties. Tripadvisor also expects additional jurisdictions may make similar assessments or pass similar new laws in the future, and any of the jurisdictions where Tripadvisor has sales may apply more rigorous enforcement efforts or take more aggressive positions in the future that could result in greater tax liability allegations. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may materially adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nTripadvisor continues to be subject to significant potential tax liabilities in connection with its spin-off from Expedia (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d). Under the tax sharing agreement between Tripadvisor and Expedia entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, Tripadvisor is generally required to indemnify Expedia for any taxes resulting from the Spin-Off (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies). Tripadvisor continues to be responsible for potential tax liabilities in connection with consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia prior to or in connection with the Spin-Off. By virtue of previously filed consolidated tax returns with Expedia, Tripadvisor is currently under IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and short-period 2011 tax years and, in connection with that audit, has received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS which would result in an increase in its worldwide income tax expense. Tripadvisor has requested competent authority assistance under the Mutual Agreement Procedure for tax years 2009 through 2011. It expects the competent authorities to present a resolution for the 2009 through 2011 tax years in the near future. Upon receipt, Tripadvisor will assess the resolution provided by the competent authorities as well as its impact on its existing income tax reserves for all open subsequent years. The outcome of these matters or any other audits could subject Tripadvisor to significant tax liabilities. See note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.\nTripadvisor faces risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, Tripadvisor faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates including, but not limited to, re-measurement of gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; and planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time it prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the Euro with another currency, Tripadvisor\u2019s sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro or the British pound, could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s net revenue growth in future periods. In the event of severe volatility in exchange rates, the impact of these exposures can increase and the impact on results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of Tripadvisor\u2019s business have made hedging these exposures more complex. Tripadvisor hedges certain short-term foreign currency exposures with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These forward exchange contracts only help mitigate the impact of changes in\nI-30\nforeign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that Tripadvisor\u2019s forward exchange contracts will have their intended effects.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Tripadvisor and developments in its business. The fair value of our investment in Tripadvisor, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which represents a significant portion of our total market value. Since our common stock began trading in 2014, the share price of our Series A common stock has had a tendency to move in tandem with the share price of Tripadvisor's common stock. As a result, our Series A common stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Tripadvisor and developments in its business.\nIt may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u25cf the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nAdditionally, certain provisions of the Investment Agreement may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. In particular, if our board of directors approves the initiation of a sale process to effect a change in control of our company or the entry into negotiations with a third-party for a change in control, and, at such time, Certares beneficially owns a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value equal to at least the Threshold Amount, the Investment Agreement requires us to provide notice of such intent to Certares, designate a nationally recognized investment bank to act as financial advisor, and provide Certares the opportunity to participate as a potential buyer. In addition, if Certares owns a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value equal to at least the Threshold Amount, subject to certain exceptions, Certares is entitled to certain rights to match offers consisting of at least 90% of cash consideration to acquire us or our Series B common stock owned by Gregory B. Maffei, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be.\nFurther, Mr. Maffei beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 43% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 97% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2022.\nI-31\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14873, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LTRPA"}
