{"cik": "1219210", "company": "IKANOS COMMUNICATIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the SEC, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\nWe have a history of losses, and future losses or the inability to raise additional capital may adversely impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 28, 2014, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses from operations. Since our inception, we have never been profitable on an annual basis and we have incurred significant net losses leading to an accumulated deficit of $369.4 million as of December 28, 2014.\nWe may need to seek financing in the future. These financings could include the sale of equity securities (which would result in dilution to our stockholders) or we may incur additional indebtedness (which would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations). There can be no assurance that any such equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The failure to obtain additional equity or debt financing, if needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, and financial condition.\nIf we are unsuccessful in negotiating a definitive collaboration agreement with Alcatel-Lucent, we will not enjoy all of the benefits of the proposed collaboration and will lose any revenue that would have been generated under such agreement.\nIn September 2014 we signed a term sheet with Alcatel-Lucent (\"ALU\"), most of which is binding, outlining the terms of the collaboration arrangement and the requirement to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement. If we fail to enter into a definitive agreement with ALU, we will not realize revenue from the potential sale of products resulting from the collaboration arrangement, which would harm our results of operations and our reputation.\nIf we do not enter into a definitive collaboration agreement with Alcatel-Lucent, we cannot draw down on the ALU Loan.\nWe have entered into a loan agreement with Alcatel Lucent under which we can borrow up to $10.0 million (\"ALU Loan Agreement\"). Our ability to draw on the ALU Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including entering into a collaboration agreement with Alcatel-Lucent for the development of ultra-broadband products. Our inability to access the proceeds of the ALU Loan could have a negative effect on our liquidity, which could result in a failure to comply with certain covenants under our SVB Loan Agreement (as described below).\nWe utilize a revolving credit facility to fund our operations. Should we no longer have access to the revolving line of credit, it would materially impact our business, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOn October 7, 2014, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the SVB Loan Agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB. Under the SVB Loan Agreement we may borrow up to $20 million, subject to certain limitations. The SVB Loan Agreement is collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our present and future property and assets, other than our intellectual property, which is subject to a second lien on and a first priority lien in favor of ALU. The SVB Loan Agreement also requires that we maintain a minimum monthly Adjusted Quick Ratio (as defined) of 1.2 to 1.0. From time-to-time we draw advances under the SVB Loan Agreement and repay the advances as our receivables are collected. As of December 28, 2014, the balance under the SVB Loan Agreement was approximately $10.8 million. We were not in compliance with the covenants contained in the original SVB loan agreement as of September 28, 2014. Those covenants were replaced when the SVB Loan Agreement was amended, and we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants in the SVB Loan Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the terms of the Amended SVB Loan Agreement in the future nor, should a default occur, that we would be successful in obtaining a further amendment to the agreement to avoid SVB declaring a default. Should we be in default of the terms of the SVB Loan Agreement and fail to obtain an amendment prior to SVB declaring us to be in default, SVB could require that any advances under the SVB Loan\nAgreement be repaid immediately, which immediate repayment would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur SVB Loan Agreement is subject to contractual and borrowing base limitations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and business.\nThe maximum amount we can borrow under our SVB Loan Agreement is subject to contractual and borrowing base limitations, which could significantly and negatively impact our future access to capital required to operate our business. Borrowing base limitations are based upon eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable are deemed ineligible, because, for example, they are resident outside certain geographical regions or a receivable is older than 90 days, the amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility would be reduced. These limitations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and business.\nOur Loan Agreements contain financial covenants that may limit our operating and strategic flexibility.\nOur SVB Loan Agreement and ALU Loan Agreement, or collectively, our Loan Agreements, contain financial covenants and other restrictions that limit our ability to engage in certain types of transactions. For example, these restrictions limit our ability to, or do not permit us to, incur additional debt, pay cash dividends, make other distributions or repurchase stock, engage in certain merger and acquisition activity, and make certain capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with all covenants in the future or that SVB or Alcatel-Lucent, or collectively, our Lenders, will agree to modify the SVB Loan Agreement or the ALU Loan Agreement, respectively, should that become necessary.\nEvents beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our Loan Agreements. If we do not cure an event of default or obtain necessary waivers within the required time periods, our Lenders would be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the debt under our Loan Agreements, foreclose upon our assets securing the debt, and terminate any further commitments to lend. Under these circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy our other obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by our Loan Agreements may significantly impair our ability to obtain other debt or equity financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any waivers we request will be received on a timely basis, if at all, or that any waivers obtained will extend for a sufficient period of time to avoid an acceleration event, an event of default, or other restrictions on our business. The failure to obtain any necessary waivers could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur history of losses as well as future losses or inability to raise additional capital, may adversely impact our relationships with customers and potential customers.\nSince our inception, we have never been profitable on an annual basis and we have incurred significant net losses leading to an accumulated deficit of $369.4 million as of December 28, 2014. To achieve profitability, we will need to generate and sustain higher revenue and improve our gross margins, while maintaining expense levels that are appropriate and necessary for our business. We may not be able to achieve profitability and, even if we were able to attain profitability, we may not be able to sustain profitability on an on-going quarterly or annual basis. Since we compete with companies that have greater financial stability, our customers or potential customers may be reluctant to enter into arrangements with us due to the perceived risks to our long term viability and this, in turn, may adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe recently implemented a reverse stock split in order to remain listed on NASDAQ and our inability to maintain such listing in the future could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business.\nBeginning on January 31, 2014, our common stock began to trade below $1.00 per share on The NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ. On March 18, 2014, we received notification from NASDAQ indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), which Rule provides that securities listed by NASDAQ must maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and that based upon the closing bid price for our securities for the previous 30 consecutive business days, we no longer meet this requirement. NASDAQ further notified the us that, in accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until September 15, 2014, to regain compliance by achieving a closing bid price of our securities of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180 calendar day period. As we did not anticipate regaining compliance by September 15, 2014, on September 2, 2014, we requested that NASDAQ grant to us a second 180 day compliance period. On September 16, 2014, NASDAQ notified us that we were eligible for a second 180 calendar day compliance period, or until March 16, 2015, to regain compliance, based on having met the continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other\napplicable requirements for initial listing on NASDAQ, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our written notice of our intention to cure the bid price deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. Effective February 13, 2015 we implemented a 1:10 reverse split of our outstanding common stock and we were notified by NASDAQ thereafter that we had regained compliance with this continued listing requirements.\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). If we are again subject to delisting for any reason, including the failure to maintain the minimum closing bid price, such action would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the trading market for our common stockand our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by our investors, suppliers, and employees.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and holders of our common stock may not be able to resell shares at or above the price paid, or at all.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nquarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with NASDAQ minimum bid price, as discussed above;\n\u2022\nchanges in our senior management;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our new products;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers, or us;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of market share in any of our markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nspecific conditions in the semiconductor industry and broadband technology markets, including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated;\n\u2022\ncontinuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perceptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in product mix; or\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations relating to our products, plans, and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers.\nThe closing price of our common stock for the period of January 1, 2012 to December 28, 2014 ranged from a low of $2.80 to a high of $20.20. In addition, the market prices of securities of semiconductor and other technology companies have been volatile, particularly for companies like us, with relatively low trading volumes. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price paid.\nIf the securities analysts who currently publish reports on us do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion regarding our common stock, the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us and our business. Currently, one analyst periodically publish reports about our company. If that analyst issues an adverse opinion regarding our common stock, the stock price would likely decline. If the analyst ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose further visibility to the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nTakeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable may be delayed or discouraged due to our corporate charter and bylaws which contain anti-takeover provisions, Delaware law in general, or the Tallwood Group\u2019s significant ownership of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to expand the size of our Board and to elect directors to fill any such vacancies;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of a classified board of directors, which provides that not all members of the Board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend, or repeal our bylaws or amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors, and the ability of stockholders to take action;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove directors for cause; and\n\u2022\nno right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders or to take action by written consent.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nDue to the significant number of shares of our common stock that the Tallwood Group holds, as discussed below, the Tallwood Group may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, including a takeover attempt, and may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, our interests and those of our other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Commercial Business\nWe are in a product-transition phase impacting revenue in the short term and we may not be able to adequately develop, market, or sell new products necessary to increase our quarterly revenue run rate.\nRevenues from our more mature products are decreasing as these products near end-of-life and this decrease in revenues is likely to keep our quarterly revenue relatively flat to declining in the near term. Increases in revenue will be derived from new products, however, revenue from these new products may not offset the declines in revenue from our mature products in the short-term, long-term, or at all. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, we began selling our next generation Gateway product Fusiv Vx185, Vx183, Vx175, and Vx173 chipsets. Further, we are currently developing a new broadband DSL Access\nplatform that incorporates vectoring technology. The successful customer migration to our new products is critical to our business, takes substantial time and effort, and there is no assurance that we are or will be able to market and or sell new products and services in a timely manner. Our newer products and services, including our Vx585 family and Velocity-3 products, may continue to be delayed, and new products may not be accepted by the market, may be accepted later than anticipated, or may be replaced by newer products more quickly than anticipated. Our sales and operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to bring new products to market, if customers delay purchases, or if acceptance of new products is slower than expected or to a smaller degree than expected, if at all. Failure of future offerings to be accepted by the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nBecause we depend on a relatively small number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, the loss of any of our key customers, our inability to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities, or our failure to attract significant new customers, could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business.\nWe have in the past, and expect in the future, to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of significant customers. Our three largest customers accounted for approximately 67% of our revenue for 2014 and four customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenue for 2013. For the year ended December 28, 2014, Sagemcom, Amod Technology Inc., Ltd. (a distributor selling exclusively to Sagemcom\u2019s OEM), and Paltek Corporation represented 29%, 22%, and 16% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 29, 2013, Sagemcom, Askey ( a contract manufacturer for Sagemcom), AVM Computersysteme Vertriebs GmbH, and Paltek Corporation represented 24%, 14%, 11%, and 10% of our revenue, respectively. The composition and concentration of these customers has varied in the past, and we expect that it will continue to vary in the future. Accordingly, the loss of any significant customer or a decline in business with any significant customer would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may experience pressure from significant customers to agree to customer-favorable sales terms and price reductions.\nOur lack of long-term agreements with our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe typically do not have contracts with our major customers that obligate them to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Sales to these customers are made pursuant to purchase orders, which typically can be canceled or modified up to a specified point in time, which may be after we have incurred significant costs related to the sale. If any of our key customers significantly reduced or canceled its orders, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Because many of our semiconductor products have long product design and development cycles, it would be difficult for us to replace revenues from key customers that reduce or cancel their existing orders for these products, which may happen if they experience lower than anticipated demand for their products or cancel a program. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets, which could reduce our market share and negatively affect our revenue.\nThe semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets are intensely competitive. In the VDSL or VDSL-like technology and communications processing markets, we currently compete or expect to compete with, among others, Broadcom Corporation, Cavium, Inc., Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Lantiq Deutschland GmbH (which recently announced a definitive merger agreement with Intel Corporation), Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MediaTek Inc., PMC-Sierra, Inc., and Realtek Semiconductor Corp.\nMany of our competitors have stronger manufacturing subcontractor relationships than we have as well as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, and other resources. In addition, many of our competitors have extensive technology libraries that could enable them to incorporate broadband or communications processing technologies into a system on a chip, creating a more attractive product line than ours. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we are able to. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers, or other third parties. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Existing or new competitors may also develop alternative technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of semiconductor integration, or lower cost. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors, in which case we may lose market share and our revenue may fail to increase or may decline.\nOur success is dependent upon achieving new design wins into commercially successful systems sold by our OEM and ODM customers.\nOur products are generally incorporated into our OEM and ODM customers\u2019 systems at the design stage. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs to select our products to be designed into their systems. We refer to this as a design pipeline win. A pipeline win is defined as achieving one of the following: a potential customer who has signed a memorandum of understanding to design our products into its portfolio; signed a definitive contract; entered into a prototype purchase order for 100 units; or issued an e-mail stating the customer's intent to award a design to us with a defined carrier or end customer.At any given time, we are competing for one or more design wins. We often incur significant expenditures over multiple quarters without any assurance that we will achieve a design win. Furthermore, even if we achieve a design win, we cannot be assured that the OEM or ODM equipment that we are designed into will be marketed, sold, or commercially successful and, accordingly, we may not generate any revenue from the design win. In addition, our OEM and ODM customers can choose at any time to discontinue their systems that include our products or delay deployment, which has occurred in the past from time-to-time. If we are unable to achieve design wins or if our OEM customers\u2019 systems incorporating our products are not commercially successful or deployed, our operating results would suffer.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly over time and are likely to continue to do so, and as a result, we may fail to meet or exceed our revenue forecasts or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, uncertain product life cycles, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has, from time-to-time, experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns, often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. To respond to these downturns, some service providers have decreased their capital expenditures, changed their purchasing practices to use refurbished equipment rather than purchasing new equipment, canceled or delayed new deployments, and taken a cautious approach to acquiring new equipment and technologies from OEMs, usually with very little notice. This, in turn, has reduced the demand for new semiconductors by our direct customers which could result in significant fluctuations of revenue as the economy changes. Any future downturns may reduce our revenue and could result in our accumulating excess inventory. By contrast, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased demand and competition for limited production capacity, which may affect our ability to ship products and prevent us from benefiting from such an upturn. Accordingly, our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor or broadband communications industry, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFluctuations in our expenses could affect our operating results.\nOur expenses are subject to fluctuations resulting from various factors, including, but not limited to, higher expenses associated with new product releases, addressing technical issues arising from development efforts, unanticipated tapeout costs, additional or unanticipated costs for manufacturing or components because we do not have formal pricing arrangements with our subcontractors, costs of design tools, and large up-front license fees to third parties for intellectual property integrated into our products, as well as other factors identified throughout these risk factors.\nBecause many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to reduce our expenses sufficiently to mitigate any reductions in revenue. Therefore, it may be necessary to take other measures to align expenses with revenue, including, implementation of a corporate restructuring plan. We last implemented a restructuring plan in 2012. Restructuring charges included expenses related to the severance for terminated employees and other exit-related costs arising from contractual and other obligations.\nGeneral macroeconomic conditions could reduce demand for services based upon our products.\nOur business is susceptible to macroeconomic and other world market conditions. As an example, we believe that consumer-targeted broadband services, which are deployed using our technology, are part of most households\u2019 discretionary spending. We believe the global financial economic downturn that began in 2008 and continues into 2014, particularly in Europe, negatively affected consumer confidence and spending. These outcomes and behaviors may adversely affect our business and financial condition. If individual consumers decide not to install-or discontinue purchasing-broadband services in their homes, whether to save money in an uncertain economic climate or otherwise, the resulting drop in demand could cause telecommunications service providers to reduce or stop placing orders for OEM equipment containing our products. Accordingly, the OEMs\u2019 demand for our products could drop further, potentially having a materially negative effect on our revenue.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward consolidation in our industry. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, rapid consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of customers we serve. Loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop, introduce, or achieve market acceptance of our new semiconductor products, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation and intense competition. Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to predict what new products are needed to meet the demand of the broadband, communications processor, or other markets addressable by our products and then introduce, develop, and distribute such products in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development of new semiconductor products is complex, and from time-to-time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. In the past we have invested substantial resources in developing and purchasing emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected.\nOur ability to develop and deliver new semiconductor products successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate our products with our OEM customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ngain market acceptance of our products and our OEM customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\naccurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards;\n\u2022\naccurately define new semiconductor products;\n\u2022\ntimely complete and introduce new product designs or features;\n\u2022\ntimely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the equipment into which our products will be incorporated;\n\u2022\nensure that our subcontractors have sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials and achieve acceptable manufacturing yields; and\n\u2022\nshift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new semiconductor products successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, we will not be able to attract new customers or retain our existing customers, which would harm our business.\nIf we do not successfully manage our inventory in the transition process to next generation semiconductor products, our operating results may be harmed.\nIf we are successful in developing new semiconductor products ahead of competitors but do not cost-effectively manage our inventory levels of existing products when making the transition to the new semiconductor products, our financial results could be negatively affected by high levels of obsolete inventory and our operating results would be harmed.\nThe average selling prices and gross margins of our products are subject to declines, which may harm our revenue and profitability.\nOur products are subject to rapid declines in average selling prices due to pressure from customers. We have lowered our prices significantly at times to gain or maintain market share, and we expect to do so again in the future. In addition, we may not be able to reduce our costs of goods sold as rapidly as our prices decline. Our financial results, in particular, but not limited to, our gross margins, will suffer if we are unable to maintain or increase pricing, or are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing our manufacturing costs, or developing new or enhanced products that command higher prices or better gross margins on a timely basis.\nOur product sales mix is subject to frequent changes, which may impact our revenue and margin.\nOur product margins vary widely by product and customer. As a result, a change in the sales mix of our products could have an impact on forecasted revenue and margins. For example, our Access product family generally has higher margins as compared to our Gateway product family. Furthermore, the product margins within our product families can vary based on the performance and type of deployment, as the market typically commands higher prices for higher performance. While we forecast a future product mix and make purchase decisions based on that forecast, actual results can be materially different which could negatively impact our revenue and margins.\nAny defects in our products could harm our reputation, customer relationships, and results of operations.\nOur products may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures, which may not become apparent until the products are in the hands of our customers or our customers\u2019 customers. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures discovered after we have sold the product could result in:\n\u2022\ncancellation of orders;\n\u2022\nproduct returns, repairs, or replacements;\n\u2022\nmonetary or other accommodations to our customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources;\n\u2022\nlegal actions by customers or customers\u2019 end users;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance and warranty costs; and\n\u2022\nother losses to us or to customers or end users.\nAny of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of these or other products and loss of sales, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. As our products become even more complex in the future, this risk may intensify over time and may result in increased expenses.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. This industry is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, excess manufacturing capacity worldwide, maturing product cycles, and declines in general economic conditions. Even if demand for our products remains constant, a lower level of available foundry capacity could increase our costs, which would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in our senior management could negatively affect our operations and relationships with our customers and employees.\nWe have in the past and may in the future experience significant changes in our senior management team. In the past three years, we have appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, a new Vice President of Operations, a new Vice President of Marketing, and a new Vice President of Sales. Changes in our senior management or technical personnel could affect our customer relationships, employee morale, and our ability to operate in compliance with existing internal controls and regulations and harm our business. If we are unable to maintain a consistent senior management team or successfully integrate our current and future members of senior management, our business could be negatively affected.\nBecause competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, we may not be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel, which could impact our product development and sales.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate our senior management team as well as qualified technical personnel, particularly software engineers, digital circuit designers, mixed-signal circuit designers, and systems and algorithms engineers. Competition for these employees is intense and many of our competitors may have greater name recognition and significantly greater financial resources to better compete for these employees. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity\nto develop and market our products. All of our key employees are employed on an \u201cat will\u201d basis. The loss of any of these key employees could slow our product development processes and sales efforts or harm the perception of our business. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert the attention of our senior management to recruit replacements for key employees. Also, our depressed common stock price may result in difficulty attracting and retaining personnel as stock options and other forms of incentive equity grants generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees, which could harm our ability to provide technologically competitive products.\nFurther, the changes in senior management as well as the multiple restructurings and reductions in force that we have recently experienced, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on employee morale and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Technology\nWe rely on third-party technologies for the development of our products, and our inability to use such technologies in the future or the failure of such technology would harm our ability to remain competitive.\nWe rely on third parties for technologies that are integrated into some of our products, including memory cells, input/output cells, hardware interfaces, and core processor logic. If we are unable to continue to use or license these technologies on reasonable terms, or if these technologies fail to operate properly, we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner and our ability to remain competitive would be harmed. Further, if we were to seek such a license and such license were available, we could be required to make significant payments with respect to past and/or future sales of our products, and such payments may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. If a party determines to pursue claims against us for patent infringement, we might not be able to successfully defend against such claims. In addition, the third party intellectual property could also expose us to liability and, while we have not experienced material warranty costs in any period as a result of third party intellectual property, there can be no assurance that we will not experience such costs in the future.\nOur service agreement with eSilicon Corporation, or eSilicon, limits our ownership and control of raw materials and work-in-process. Should eSilicon default on its contractual commitments to us or fail to timely deliver furnished goods, it would negatively impact our revenue and reputation.\nIn 2012, we entered into an agreement with eSilicon, or the Service Agreement, under which eSilicon handles a majority of our day-to-day supply chain management, production test engineering, and production quality engineering functions. Pursuant to the Service Agreement, we place orders for our finished goods with eSilicon, who, in turn, contracts with wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors, and manages these operational functions for us on a day-to-day basis. eSilicon owns the raw materials and work-in-process until such time as the products are delivered to us as finished goods. Should eSilicon default on its contractual obligation to deliver finished goods to us in a timely manner, or at all, we may be required to restart the wafer production process with a total cycle time of approximately one calendar quarter. As a result, we may be required to incur additional costs and we would experience delays in delivering products to our customers, which would result in decreased revenue, have a negative effect on operating results, and harm our reputation.\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company and failure to secure and maintain sufficient capacity with eSilicon and its subcontractors could significantly disrupt shipment of our products, impair our relationships with customers, and decrease sales, which would negatively impact our market share and operating results.\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company and are therefore dependent on and currently use multiple third-party wafer foundries and other subcontractors, located primarily in Israel, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, to manufacture, assemble, and test all of our semiconductor devices. While we work with multiple suppliers, generally each individual product is made by one foundry and processed at a single assembly and test subcontractor. Accordingly, we have been and will continue to be greatly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to deliver quality products in a timely manner. In past periods of high demand in the semiconductor market, we have experienced delays in obtaining sufficient capacity to meet our demand and as a result were unable to deliver all of the products to our customers on a timely basis. In addition, we have experienced similar delays due to technical and quality control problems. We are dependent on eSilicon and, in turn, its suppliers to deliver our products on time.\nIf we and/or eSilicon were to need to qualify a new facility to meet a need for additional capacity, or if a foundry or subcontractor ceased working with eSilicon, as has happened in the past, or if production is disrupted (including an event where eSilicon ceases its business operations), we may be unable to meet our customer demand on a timely basis, or at all. We may be required to incur additional costs and may need to successfully qualify an alternative facility in order to not disrupt our business.\nOur service agreement with eSilicon terminates in October 2015 and should the service agreement not be renewed, we will incur costs and risks associated with a transition away from eSilicon, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWhen our service agreement with eSilicon terminates in October 2015, if it is not renewed, we will incur costs and risks associated with the transition back to providing such services ourselves or to a new outsourced service provider. Either transition will require the time and attention of management and introduces risk associated with ensuring the transition does not interrupt our supply of product. If such transition were to occur and our supply of product suffered from interruptions due to the transition, it would negatively impact our operating results and reputation.\nIn the event that we seek to use new wafer foundries to manufacture a portion of our semiconductor products, we may not be able to bring the new foundries on-line rapidly enough and may not achieve anticipated cost reductions.\nAs indicated above, we have used and will continue to use a limited number of independent wafer foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products, which could expose us to risks of delay, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction in the event that any of these foundries are unable to meet our requirements. Additional wafer foundries may be sought to meet our future requirements but the qualification process typically requires several months or more. By the time a new foundry is qualified, the need for additional capacity may have passed or we may have lost the potential opportunity to a competitor. If qualification cannot be met in a timely manner, we would experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products, which could in turn cause our costs of revenue to increase and our overall revenue to decrease. This would harm our customer relationships and our market share, as well as our operating results would suffer.\nWhen demand for manufacturing capacity is high, we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results.\nAlthough we have purchase order commitments to supply specified levels of products to our OEM customers, neither we nor eSilicon have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our foundries or subcontractors\u2019 facilities that we depend upon to produce our semiconductors. Facility capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. We place our orders on the basis of our OEM customers\u2019 purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand, and eSilicon or its foundries and subcontractors may not be able to meet our requirements in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn order to secure sufficient manufacturing facility capacity when demand is high and mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs, we may enter into various arrangements with eSilicon, or directly with foundries or other subcontractors, that could be costly and negatively affect our operating results, including minimum order quantities over extended periods, and payment of premiums to secure necessary lead-times.\nWe may not be able to make such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, not be on terms favorable to us, and may contain financial penalties if we do not use all of our allocated facility capacity. These penalties and obligations may be expensive and could harm our business.\nDefects and poor performance in our products could result in a loss of customers, decreased revenue, unexpected expenses, and loss of market share, and we may face warranty and product liability claims arising from defective products.\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, defects (commonly referred to as \u201cbugs\u201d) in our products which may not always be detected by testing processes. Defects can result from a variety of causes, including, but not limited to, manufacturing problems or third party intellectual property that we have incorporated into our products. If defects are discovered after our products have shipped, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, warranty and consequential damage claims from our customers. If we are unable to deliver quality products, our reputation would be harmed, which could result in the loss of future orders from our customers. Further, we may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on some of our products, which may result in higher per unit cost, shipment delays, and increased expenses associated with resolving yield problems. If any of these adverse risks are realized and we are not able to offset the lost opportunities, our revenue, margins, and operating results would decline.\nIf our forecasts of our OEM customers\u2019 demand are inaccurate, our financial condition and liquidity would suffer.\nWe place some orders with our suppliers based on the forecasts of our OEM customers\u2019 demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates. If we do not accurately forecast customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell. As a result, as we experienced in the past, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, resulting in a decline in the value of our inventory, which would increase our cost of revenue, negatively affect gross margins, and reduce our liquidity. Similarly, if our forecast underestimates customer demand, we may forgo revenue opportunities, lose market share, and damage customer relationships. Our failure to accurately manage inventory against demand would adversely affect our financial results.\nTo remain competitive, we may need to migrate to smaller geometrical processes and our failure to do so may harm our business.\nWe periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometrical processes, which are measured in microns or nanometers. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which has resulted in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased product costs and expenses. Additionally, upfront expenses associated with smaller geometrical process technologies such as for masks and tooling can be significantly higher than those for the processes that we currently use, and our migration to these newer process technologies can result in significantly higher research and development expenses.\nThird-party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products, require us to redesign our products, or seek licenses from third parties, and harm our business. In addition, any litigation that we are required to defend regarding such claims could result in significant expenses and diversion of our resources.\nOther companies in the semiconductor industry and intellectual property holding companies often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. From time-to-time, we receive, and we are likely to continue to receive in the future, notices that claim our products infringe upon other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. We may in the future be engaged in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents, and it is possible that we would not prevail in any such lawsuit. An adverse determination in any of these types of claims could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products, could increase our costs of products and could expose us to significant liability. In addition, a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that could require us to stop selling certain products in that market or redesign certain products offered for sale or that are under development. In addition, we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful. Even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could nevertheless result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend.\nMany companies in the semiconductor industry have significant patent portfolios. These companies and other parties may claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. We may become involved in litigation as a result of allegations that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any party asserting that our products infringe their proprietary rights could force us to defend ourselves, and possibly our customers, against the alleged infringement. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. We could also be forced to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop selling, incorporating, or using our products that utilize the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or we could be required us to make significant payments with respect to past or future sales of our products;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that use any allegedly infringing technology, which may be costly and time-consuming; or\n\u2022\nrefund to our customers amounts received for allegedly infringing technology or products.\nAny potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property could also include our customers which could trigger our indemnification obligations to one or more of them and result in substantial expense to us.\nIn any potential dispute or claim involving a third party\u2019s patents or other intellectual property, our customers could also become the target of litigation. We are aware of certain instances in which third parties have recently notified our customers that their products (incorporating our technology) may infringe on the third parties\u2019 technology. We expect that our customers may receive similar notices in the future. Because we have entered into agreements whereby we have agreed to indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology, any litigation could trigger indemnification obligations. Any indemnity claim could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and result in substantial expense to us.\nOther data transmission technologies and communications processing technologies may compete effectively with the services enabled by our products, which could adversely affect our revenue and business.\nOur revenue currently is dependent upon the increase in demand for services that use broadband technology and integrated residential gateways. Besides xDSL and other discrete multi-tone, or DMT,-based technologies, service providers\ncan decide to deploy passive optical network or fiber and there would be reduced need for our products. If more service providers decide to extend fiber all the way to the home, commonly referred to as fiber to the home, or FTTH, deployment, it could harm our xDSL business. Furthermore, residential gateways compete against a variety of different data distribution technologies, including Ethernet routers, set-top boxes provided by cable and satellite providers, wireless, or WiFi and WiMax, and emerging power line and multimedia over coax alliance technologies. If any of these competing technologies proves to be more reliable, faster, less expensive, or has any other advantages over the broadband technologies we provide, the demand for our products may decrease and our business would be harmed.\nRapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and operating results to suffer.\nWe design our products to conform to regulations established by governments and to standards set by industry standards bodies worldwide, such as the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, or ATIS, and the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standard, or ITU-T. Because our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards, if competing standards emerge that are preferred by our customers, we would have to make significant expenditures to develop new products. If our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible, industry groups adopt new standards, or governments issue new regulations with which our products are not compatible, our existing products would become less desirable to our customers, and our revenue and operating results would suffer.\nIf we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue, or increase our cost.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. From time-to-time we file new patent applications. These pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies or may be determined to be invalid or unenforceable. While we are not currently aware of any misappropriation of our existing technology, policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly unauthorized use in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protection and, even if such protection was available, the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as United States law. The patents we have obtained or licensed, or may obtain or license in the future, may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Our competitors may independently develop or may have already developed technology similar to us, duplicate our products, or design around any patents issued to us or our other intellectual property. In addition, we have been, and may be, required to license our patents as a result of our participation in various standards organizations. If competitors appropriate our technology and it is not adequately protected, our competitive position would be harmed, our legal costs would increase, and our revenue would decrease.\nChanges in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business.\nThe effects of regulation on our customers and the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business. For example, various governments around the world have considered, and it is anticipated that others may consider, regulations that would limit or prohibit sales of certain telecommunications products manufactured in China. If these rules apply to equipment containing our semiconductor products, such regulation could reduce sales of our products and have a negative effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan, the Ministry of Communications and Information in Korea, various national regulatory agencies in Europe, the European Commission in the European Union, and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission have broad jurisdiction over our target markets. Although the laws and regulations of these and other government agencies may not be directly applicable to our products, they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated. Governmental regulatory agencies worldwide may affect the ability of telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business, which may in turn impede sales of our products.\nIn addition to the laws and regulations specific to telecommunications equipment, other laws and regulations affect our business. For instance, changes in tax, employment, and import/export laws and regulations, and their enforcement, commonly occur in the countries in which we operate. If changes in those laws and regulations, or in the enforcement of those laws and regulations, occur in a manner that we did not anticipate, those changes could cause us to have increased operating costs or to pay higher taxes, and thus have a negative effect on our operating results.\nFailure to maintain adequate internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and our investors\u2019 view of us.\nIf we do not maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of SOX. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventory, and warranty provisions, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nWe are exposed to legal, business, political, and economic risks associated with our international operations.\nWe currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly, and testing services from suppliers and subcontractors located outside of the United States, and have a significant portion of our research and development team located in India. In addition, 99%. 97%, and 99% of our revenue for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. We have expanded our international business activities and may open other design and operational centers abroad. International operations are subject to many other inherent risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical, social, and economic instability, including war and terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntrade and travel restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls and restrictions or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements and restrictions of the United States and each other country in which we operate;\n\u2022\nforeign technical standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exposure and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nBecause we are currently almost wholly dependent on our foreign sales, as well as our research and development facilities located off-shore and operations in foreign jurisdictions, any of the factors described above could significantly harm our ability to produce quality products in a timely and cost effective manner, as well as our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales.\nFluctuations in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which we do business may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe maintain extensive operations internationally. We have offices or facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. We incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including, predominantly, the Indian rupee and the Chinese yuan. A large portion of our cash is held by our international affiliates both in U.S. dollar and local currency denominations. As a result, we may experience foreign exchange gains or losses due to the volatility of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. Because we report our results in U.S. dollars, the difference in exchange rates in one period compared to another directly impacts period to period comparisons of our operating results. In addition, our sales have been historically denominated in U.S. dollars. Currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past and these currency fluctuations may make it difficult for us to predict and/or provide guidance on our results. Currently, we have not implemented any strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and we cannot predict future currency exchange rate changes.\nSeveral of the facilities that manufacture our products, most of our OEM customers and the service providers they serve, and our California headquarters are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters.\nSeveral of our subcontractors\u2019 facilities that manufacture, assemble, and test our products, and most of our wafer foundries, are located in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Several of our large customers are located in Japan and Korea. The Asia-Pacific region has experienced significant earthquakes and other natural disasters in the past and will be subject to seismic activities in the future. Any earthquake or other natural disaster in these areas could significantly disrupt these manufacturing facilities\u2019 production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery, or substantial shortage of wafers, in particular, and possibly in higher wafer prices, and increased production costs in general. Natural disasters could also adversely affect our customers and their demand for our products. Our headquarters in California is also located near major earthquake fault lines. If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located, it could significantly disrupt our operations.\nChanges in our tax rates could affect our future results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by the absolute amount and future geographic distribution of our pre-tax income, our ability to successfully shift our operating activities to foreign jurisdictions, and the amount and timing of intercompany payments from our foreign operations that are subject to U.S. income taxes. In addition, our subsidiary in India is currently being audited by the tax authorities in that country. Should the audit or any subsequent appeals result in a decision adverse to us, such decision could not only result in assessments for prior periods, but also an increased tax rate in future periods.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d have resulted in additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex, and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, and adjoining countries. There were and continue to be costs associated with complying with these rules, includes costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of such minerals. For example, there may only be a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d materials, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary \u201cconflict free\u201d materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation, could increase our costs, and could adversely affect our manufacturing operations. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict mineral free.\nRisks Related to Tallwood\nThe Tallwood Group may exercise significant influence over us as a significant stockholder and holder of a right to elect the proportionate number of directors equal to its ownership interest in us.\nAs of February 15, 2015, the Tallwood Group beneficially owned approximately 51% of our outstanding common stock.\nWe are also party to a Stockholder Agreement with the Tallwood Group, which, among other things, contains certain governance arrangements and various provisions relating to board composition, stock ownership, transfers by the Tallwood Group, voting, registration rights, and other matters. Subject to certain exceptions, the Tallwood Group is permitted under the terms of the Stockholder Agreement to maintain their ownership interest in us in subsequent equity offerings. Given their current ownership interest in us, the Tallwood Group may have the ability to control or significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. The Tallwood Group may also have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, our interests and those of our other stockholders. Certain voting restrictions in the Stockholder Agreement require that the Tallwood Group vote all shares owned by it in excess of 37.5% of the outstanding voting shares in the same proportion as the votes of all stockholders that are not affiliated with the Tallwood Group, will expire five years after the Rights Offering. At that time, the Tallwood Group may continue to own a majority of the outstanding voting shares, which will give the Tallwood Group the ability to control our Board and the outcome of any vote of our stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on the other stockholders. Even if the Tallwood Group does not own a majority of the outstanding voting shares, it may have substantial holdings that could give the Tallwood Group effective control of the affairs of our Company because it may own a majority of the shares that actually vote at any meeting of our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of future sales of our common stock by the Tallwood Group.\nWe are unable to predict the potential effects of the Tallwood Group\u2019s ownership of our outstanding common stock on the trading activity in and market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, we have granted the Tallwood Group and their permitted transferees\u2019 registration rights for the resale of all shares of our common stock that the Tallwood Group holds. Any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by the Tallwood Group or their permitted transferees of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nStockholders may not want to invest in our company given the significant ownership of our common stock by the Tallwood Group.\nThe Tallwood Group\u2019s ownership of our common stock may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders and its interests may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, the Tallwood Group may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investments in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, this concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant stockholder.", "PERMNO": 90901, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "IKAN"}
