{"cik": "1593034", "company": "Endo International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and we face competition in our branded and generic pharmaceutical business. In addition to product development, safety, efficacy, commercialization, marketing and promotion, other competitive factors include product quality and price, reputation, service and access to scientific and technical information. Many of our competitors, including Abbott, Allergan, Purdue, Jazz, Shire, Horizon, Mallinckrodt, Teva, Mylan, Sandoz and Impax, among others, may have greater resources than we do and we cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of competitors\u2019 products. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. It is possible that our competitors may make greater research and development investments and have more efficient or superior processes and systems and that their new products may make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If we fail to compete successfully, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur branded products face competition from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly cheaper than branded versions and, where available, may be required or encouraged in place of the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law. The entrance of generic competition to our branded products generally reduces our market share and adversely affects our profitability and cash flows. Further, certain Asian and other overseas generic competitors may be able to produce products at costs lower than the costs of domestic manufacturers. If we experience substantial competition from Asian or other overseas generic competitors with lower production costs, our profit margins will suffer. In addition, certain of our branded products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection. Loss of patent protection for a branded product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes. As a result, sales of many of these branded products may decline or stop growing over time. Generic competition with our branded products has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on the net sales and profitability of our branded products.\nIn addition, our generics business faces competition from brand-name pharmaceutical companies, which have taken aggressive steps to thwart or delay competition from generic equivalents of their brand-name products. The actions taken by competing brand name pharmaceutical companies may increase the costs and risks associated with our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.\nOur sales may also suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products by competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nIf generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our branded drugs, our sales may suffer.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic bioequivalent version of a previously approved drug, without requiring the ANDA applicant to undertake the full clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its generic product is bioequivalent to the branded product.\nVarious generic manufacturers have filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval for generic versions of certain of our key pharmaceutical products, including but not limited to Lidoderm\u00ae, both formulations of OPANA\u00ae ER, Aveed\u00ae and Megace ES\u00ae. In connection with such filings, these manufacturers have challenged the validity and/or enforceability of one or more of the underlying patents protecting our products. In the case of Lidoderm\u00ae and Megace ES\u00ae, we no longer have patent protection in the markets where we sell these products. Our revenues from Lidoderm\u00ae have been negatively affected by Actavis\u2019s September 2013 launch and Mylan\u2019s August 2015 launch of their lidocaine patch 5%, generic versions of Lidoderm\u00ae, and we anticipate that these revenues could decrease further should one or more additional generic versions launch. With respect to OPANA\u00ae ER, Aveed\u00ae and other branded pharmaceutical products, it has been and continues to be our practice to vigorously defend and pursue all available legal and regulatory avenues in defense of the intellectual property rights protecting our products. Despite our efforts to defend our products, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict the timing or outcome of our efforts. If we are not successful in defending our intellectual property rights or opt to settle, or if a product\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights expire or become otherwise unenforceable, our competitors could ultimately launch generic versions of our products, which could significantly decrease our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as well as our share price. For a complete description of the related legal proceedings, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report \"Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\". As a result, there are currently ongoing legal proceedings brought by us and/or our subsidiaries, and in certain cases our third party partners, against manufacturers seeking FDA approval for generic versions of our products.\nIf we fail to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our generic pharmaceutical products or fail to introduce these generic products on a timely basis, our revenues, gross margin and operating results may decline.\nThe Hatch-Waxman amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide for a period of 180 days of marketing exclusivity for a generic version of a previously approved drug for any applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to the corresponding brand-name drug (commonly referred to as a \u201cParagraph IV certification\u201d). A large portion of our revenues for our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment have been derived from the sales of generic drugs during such 180-day marketing exclusivity period permitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act and from the sale of other generic products for which there otherwise is limited competition. ANDAs that contain Paragraph IV certifications challenging patents, however, generally become the subject of patent litigation that can be both lengthy and costly. There is no certainty that we will prevail in any such litigation, that we will be the first-to-file and be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, or, if we are granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, that we will not forfeit such period. Even where we are awarded marketing exclusivity, we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA applicants who submit Paragraph IV certifications. In addition, brand-name pharmaceutical companies often authorize a generic version of the corresponding brand-name drug to be sold during any period of marketing exclusivity that is awarded (described further below). Furthermore, timely commencement of the litigation by the patent owner imposes an automatic stay of ANDA approval by the FDA for 30 months, unless the case is decided in the ANDA applicant\u2019s favor during that period. Finally, if the court decision is adverse to the ANDA applicant, the ANDA approval will be delayed until the challenged patent expires, and the applicant will not be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity.\nThe future profitability of our U.S. Generic Pharmaceutical segment depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to introduce, on a timely basis, new generic products that are either the first-to-market (or among the first-to-market) or that otherwise can gain significant market share during the 180-day marketing period as permitted by the Hatch-Waxman Act. Our ability to timely bring our products to market is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of regulatory approval of our products, which to a large extent is outside of our control, as well as the timing of competing products. Our revenues and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon our ability or the ability of our development partners to file, timely and effectively, ANDAs with the FDA or to enter into contractual relationships with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity. No assurances can be given that we will be able to develop and introduce commercially successful products in the future within the time constraints necessary to be successful. If we or our development partners are unable to continue to timely and effectively file ANDAs with the FDA or to partner with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity, our revenues and operating results may decline significantly and our prospects and business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be the subject of product liability claims or product recalls, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential risk from product liability claims, other significant litigation matters, government investigations or product recalls, including, but not limited to, such matters associated with the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products. We have been in the past, and continue to be, subject to various product liability cases, other litigations and government investigations. In addition to direct expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is a possibility of adverse publicity, loss of revenues and disruption of business as a result of product liability claims or other litigation matters. Some plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. In addition, in the age of social media, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have a wide variety of tools to advertise their services and solicit new clients for litigation. Thus, we could expect that any significant product liability litigation or mass tort in which we are a defendant will have a larger number of plaintiffs than such actions have seen historically because of the increasing use of wide-spread and media-varied advertising. In addition, it may be necessary for us to voluntarily or mandatorily recall or withdraw products that do not meet approved specifications or which subsequent data demonstrate may be unsafe or ineffective or misused. Any such recall or withdraw could result in adverse publicity, costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue. If we are found liable on a product liability claim or series of claims, defaults could be declared under our debt agreements, we could suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur pharmaceutical and medical device products may cause, or may appear to cause, serious adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions if misused, improperly prescribed or subject to faulty surgical technique. For example, we and/or certain of our subsidiaries, have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Through our Astora Women\u2019s Health Business (Astora), we and certain plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys representing mesh-related product liability claimants have entered into various Master Settlement Agreements (MSAs) regarding settling up to approximately 49,000 filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating attorneys. These MSAs, which were executed at various times since June 2013, were entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and are not in any way an admission of liability or fault by us and/or any of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, our product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases totaled $963.1 million for all known claims for which a liability is probable. We may be subject to additional liabilities arising out of these claims, and are responsible for the cost of managing these claims. In addition to claims covered by MSAs, we are currently aware of approximately 9,700 claims that have been filed, asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable. In addition, there may be other claims asserted in the future. It is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such future claims. Although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued at this time.\nWe cannot confirm to you that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses such as the cost of a recall if any claim is brought against us, regardless of the success or failure of the claim. For example, we no longer have product liability insurance to cover the claims in connection with the mesh-related litigation described above. Additionally, we may be limited by the surviving insurance policies of our acquired subsidiaries, which may not be adequate to cover against potential liabilities or other losses. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to obtain other financing could affect our ability to pay the amounts due under those liabilities not covered by insurance. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report \"Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\" for further discussion of our product liability claims.\nOur ability to protect and maintain our proprietary and licensed third party technology, which is vital to our business, is uncertain.\nOur success, competitive position and future income will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect patent rights relating to the technologies, processes and products we have developed and are currently developing and may develop in the future. Our policy is to seek patent protection for technologies, processes and products we own and to enforce the intellectual property rights we own and license. We cannot confirm to you that patent applications we submit and have submitted will result in patents being issued. If an invention qualifies as a joint invention, the joint inventor may have rights in the invention and we cannot confirm to you that the joint inventor will protect the intellectual property rights to the joint invention. We cannot confirm to you that a third party will not infringe upon, design around or develop uses not covered by any patent issued or licensed to us or that these patents will otherwise be commercially viable. In this regard, the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions is particularly uncertain. Even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the PTO, by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings. Upon the expiration or loss of necessary intellectual property protection for a product, others may manufacture and distribute our patented products, which will result in a loss of a significant portion of our sales of that product.\nIn addition, our success, particularly in our branded businesses, depends in part on the ability of our partners and suppliers to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, and protect trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property and proprietary information. Our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner\u2019s or supplier\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent third-parties from developing and/or marketing infringing products.\nWe cannot confirm to you as to the degree of protection any patents will afford, including whether the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all the countries where we conduct business. Furthermore, we cannot confirm to you that our products will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. If we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or sell products or we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products.\nThe Company also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the Company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. In addition, if the Company\u2019s employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Company\u2019s products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Company\u2019s property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.\nOur competitors or other third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property, forcing us to expend substantial resources in litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation, including losses related to \u201cat-risk\u201d product launches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCompanies that produce branded pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Patent holders may also bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling approved generic products. Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If patents are held valid, enforceable and infringed by our products, we would, unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder, need to delay selling our corresponding generic product and, if we are already selling our product, cease selling and potentially destroy existing product stock.\nThere may be situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable, or are not infringed by our marketing and sale of such products. This is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an \u201cat-risk\u201d launch. The risk involved in an at-risk launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us, the remedies available to such holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder, which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. Moreover, if a court determines that such infringement is willful, the damages could be subject to trebling. We could face substantial damages from adverse court decisions in such matters. We could also be at risk for the value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell.\nAgreements between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic pharmaceutical companies are facing increased government scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad.\nWe are involved in numerous patent litigations in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our products\u2019 listed patents and/or the applicability of these patents to the generic applicant\u2019s products. Likewise, our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment is also involved in patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies\u2019 listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic products. Therefore, settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, such settlement agreements may violate the antitrust laws. In some instances, the FTC has brought actions against brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. Accordingly, we may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC for information about a particular settlement agreement, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence an action against us alleging violation of the antitrust laws.\nIn addition, some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would limit the types of settlement agreements generic manufacturers can enter into with brand companies. In 2013, the Supreme Court, in FTC v. Actavis, determined that reverse payment patent settlements between generic and brand companies should be evaluated under the rule of reason, but provided limited guidance beyond the selection of this standard. Because the Supreme Court did not articulate the full range of criteria upon which a determination of legality of such settlements would be based or provide guidance on the precise circumstances under which such settlements would always qualify as legal, there may be extensive litigation over what constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement between a brand and generic company. We are subject to multiple lawsuits purporting to be class actions brought by direct and indirect payers alleging that our settlement agreements respectively with Watson regarding the Lidoderm\u00ae patent litigation, and with Impax regarding the Opana\u00ae ER patent litigation, were unlawful in violation of federal antitrust laws, as well as various state laws.\nWe have significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Consequently, potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles may significantly impact our profitability.\nGoodwill and other intangibles represent a significant portion of our assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately 74% and 78%, respectively, of our total assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded asset impairment charges of $3,781.2 million, $1,140.7 million and $22.5 million, respectively, which related primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets. The procedures and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing, and the results of our testing, are discussed in Item 7 of this report \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" under the captions \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d and \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d.\nEvents giving rise to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted. As a result of the significance of goodwill and other intangible assets, our results of operations and financial position in a future period could be negatively impacted should additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets occur.\nWe are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse involving the marketing and pricing of our products and services, including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products and services, including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services and inducements to healthcare professionals to prescribe and use our products. Additionally, product promotion, educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs, and other interactions with healthcare professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the FDA regulations and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute, with certain exceptions or exemptions published by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG), prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, without identical exceptions or exemptions. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may delay our introduction of new products, may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSanctions for violating these laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions and possible exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as well as potential liability under the False Claims Act and applicable state false claims acts. There can be no assurance that our practices will not be challenged under these laws in the future, that changes in these laws or interpretation of these laws would not give rise to new challenges of our practices, or that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Law enforcement agencies sometimes initiate investigations into sales, marketing and/or pricing practices based on preliminary information or evidence, and such investigations can be and often are closed without any enforcement action. Nevertheless, these types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment of penalties, and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations; (iii) diversion of management resources; (iv) injury to our reputation; and (v) decreased demand for our products.\nIn addition, our company is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions on the promotion of uses of prescription drugs or devices that are not cleared or approved by the FDA. Although the FDA does not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of medications, treatments or product uses, the FDCA and FDA regulations and guidance significantly restrict the ability of pharmaceutical and medical device companies to communicate with patients, physicians, and other third-parties about unapproved or uncleared product uses. FDA, FTC, the HHS-OIG, the DOJ and various state Attorneys General actively enforce state and federal prohibitions on the promotion of unapproved uses, as well as prohibitions against promotional practices deemed false or misleading. A company that is found to have improperly promoted its products under these laws may be subject to significant liability, including significant administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions, including but not limited to significant civil damages, criminal fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Applicable laws governing product promotion also provide for administrative, civil, and criminal liability for individuals, including, in some circumstances, potential strict vicarious liability. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.\nWe have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect, and correct violations of state and federal healthcare laws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our drugs and devices. Nonetheless, the FDA, FTC, HHS-OIG, the DOJ and/or the state Attorneys General, and qui tam relators may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements, and, if such non-compliance is proven, the Company and, in some cases, individual employees, may be subject to significant liability, including the aforementioned administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, in February 2014, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of Lidoderm\u00ae. In March 2013, our subsidiary, Par, entered into a CIA and a Plea Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of Megace ES\u00ae. Those agreements place certain obligations on us related to the marketing of our branded pharmaceutical products and our healthcare regulatory compliance program, including reporting requirements to the U.S. government, detailed requirements for our compliance program, code of conduct, and policies and procedures, and the requirement to engage an Independent Review Organization. We have implemented procedures and practices to comply with the CIA, including the engagement of an Independent Review Organization. In the event we breach the DPA, the Plea Agreement, and/or the CIA, there is a risk the government would seek remedies provided for in those agreements, including instituting criminal prosecution against us, seeking to impose stipulated penalties, or seeking to exclude us from participation in Federal health care programs.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business.\nGovernmental authorities such as the FDA impose substantial requirements on the development, manufacture, holding, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures. In addition, before obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products, we must conduct limited bioequivalence studies and other research to show comparability to the branded products. A failure to obtain satisfactory results in required pre-marketing trials may prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals. The FDA may also require companies to conduct post-approval studies and post-approval surveillance regarding their drug products and to report adverse events.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any of our new product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Likewise, we may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate\u2019s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in our failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Clinical trials can be delayed for reasons outside of our control, which can lead to increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval. For example, there is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials, and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. For example, patients may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected or patients may drop out after enrolling in the trials or during the trials. In addition, we rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements, or encounter clinical trial compliance-related issues, which may also delay clinical trials. Product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials, or manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, such as those relating to Current Good Manufacturing Practices. We also may experience delays in obtaining, or we may not obtain, required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards. We cannot confirm to you that we will not experience delays or undesired results in these or any other of our clinical trials.\nWe cannot confirm to you that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will approve, clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, with respect specifically to pharmaceutical products, the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) or ANDA to the FDA with supporting clinical safety and efficacy data, for example, does not guarantee that the FDA will grant approval to market the product. Meeting the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements to obtain approval to market a drug product, which varies substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product, typically takes years and is subject to uncertainty.\nAdditional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its Advisory Committees, it usually does. A negative Advisory Committee meeting could signal a lower likelihood of approval, although the FDA may still end up approving our application. Regardless of an Advisory Committee meeting outcome or the FDA\u2019s final approval decision, public presentation of our data may shed positive or negative light on our application. With respect to our Supplemental New Drug Application for OPANA\u00ae ER, the FDA has scheduled a Joint Meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee in March 2017, to discuss pre- and post-marketing data about the abuse of OPANA\u00ae ER and the overall risk-benefit of this product. The Advisory Committees also will discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release (IR) products. The Advisory Committees will likely make recommendations to the FDA as to whether additional measures should be taken to control the abuse potential of these products, including a possible recommendation to remove these products from U.S. markets.\nSome drugs are available in the United States that are not the subject of an FDA-approved NDA. In 2011, the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (\u201cCDER\u201d) Office of Compliance modified its enforcement policy with regard to the marketing of such \u201cunapproved\u201d marketed drugs. Under CDER\u2019s revised guidance, the FDA encourages manufacturers to obtain NDA approvals for such drugs by requiring unapproved versions to be removed from the market after an approved version has been introduced, subject to a grace period at the FDA\u2019s discretion. This grace period is intended to allow an orderly transition of supply to the market and to mitigate any potential related drug shortage. Depending on the length of the grace period and the time it takes for subsequent applications to be approved, this may result in a period of de facto market exclusivity to the first manufacturer that has obtained an approved NDA for the previously unapproved marketed drug. We may seek FDA approval for certain unapproved marketed drug products through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even if we receive approval for an NDA under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may not take timely enforcement action against companies marketing unapproved versions of the drug; therefore, we cannot be sure that that we will receive the benefit of any de facto exclusive marketing period or that we will fully recoup the expenses incurred to obtain an approval. In addition, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nThe ANDA approval process for a new product varies in time, generally requiring a minimum of 10 months following submission of the ANDA to FDA, but could also take several years from the date of application. The timing for the ANDA approval process for generic products is difficult to estimate and can vary significantly. ANDA approvals, if granted, may not include all uses (known as indications) for which a company may seek to market a product.\nFurther, once a product is approved or cleared for marketing, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals or clearances, seizures or recalls of products, injunctions against the manufacture, holding, distribution, marketing and sale of a product, and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals or clearances. Meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of our new products for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete against us.\nBased on scientific developments, post-market experience, or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products, or new indications or uses for approved or cleared products, are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past.\nSome new or evolving FDA review standards or conditions for approval or clearance were not applied to many established products currently on the market, including certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids. In particular, the FDA has expressed interest in specific chemical structures that may be present as impurities in a number of opioid narcotic active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as oxycodone, which based on certain structural characteristics and laboratory tests may indicate the potential for having mutagenic effects. FDA has required, and may continue to require, more stringent controls of the levels of these impurities in drug products for approval.\nAlso, the FDA may require labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications for new or existing products containing such impurities. The FDA\u2019s more stringent requirements, together with any additional testing or remedial measures that may be necessary, could result in increased costs for, or delays in, obtaining approval for certain of our products in development. Although we do not believe that the FDA would seek to remove a currently marketed product from the market unless such mutagenic effects are believed to indicate a significant risk to patient health, we cannot make any such assurance.\nIn May of 2016, an FDA advisory panel recommended mandatory training of all physicians who prescribe opioids on the risks of prescription opioids. In 2016, the CDC also issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain that provides recommendations for primary care clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. In addition, state health departments and boards of pharmacy have authority to regulate distribution and may modify their regulations with respect to prescription narcotics in an attempt to curb abuse. In either case, any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may delay our introduction of new products, may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe FDA has the authority to require companies to undertake additional post-approval studies to assess known or signaled safety risks and to make any labeling changes to address those risks. The FDA also can require companies to formulate approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to confirm a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks. For example, in 2011, we, along with other manufacturers of long-acting and extended-release opioid drug products, received a letter from the FDA requiring that we develop and submit to the FDA a post-market REMS plan for our OPANA\u00ae ER, morphine sulfate ER, and oxycodone ER drug products to require that training is provided to prescribers of these products, and that information is provided to prescribers that they can use in counseling patients about the risks and benefits of opioid drug use. In December 2011, the FDA approved our interim REMS for OPANA\u00ae ER, which was subsequently superseded by the class-wide extended-release/long-acting REMS approved in July 2012. The goal of this REMS is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse and abuse of extended-release or long-acting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications. The REMS includes a Medication Guide, Elements to Assure Safe Use and annual REMS Assessment Reports.\nThe FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority under the FFDCA could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements and costs. Post-marketing studies and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our products. Furthermore, the discovery of significant safety or efficacy concerns or problems with a product in the same therapeutic class as one of our products that implicate or appear to implicate the entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our product or, in some cases, result in product withdrawals. The FDA has continuing authority over the approval of an NDA or ANDA and may withdraw approval if, among other reasons, post-marketing clinical or other experience, tests or data show that a drug is unsafe for use under the conditions upon which it was approved, or if FDA determines that there is a lack of substantial evidence of the drug\u2019s efficacy under the conditions described in its labeling. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse or abuse at the user level, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or patient or trade organizations to recommend or publish guidance or guidelines related to the use of our products, which may lead to reduced sales of our products.\nThe FDA and the DEA have important and complementary responsibilities with respect to our business. The FDA administers an application and post-approval monitoring process to confirm that products that are available in the market are safe, effective and consistently of uniform, high quality. The DEA administers registration, drug allotment and accountability systems to satisfy against loss and diversion of controlled substances. Both agencies have trained investigators that routinely, or for cause, conduct inspections, and both have authority to seek to enforce their statutory authority and regulations through administrative remedies as well as civil and criminal enforcement actions.\nThe FDA regulates and monitors the quality of drug clinical trials to provide human subject protection and to support marketing applications. The FDA may place a hold on a clinical trial and may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. The FDA also regulates the facilities, processes, and procedures used to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Manufacturing facilities must be registered with the FDA and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with the latest cGMP regulations, which are enforced by the FDA. Compliance with clinical trial requirements and cGMP regulations requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant expenditures. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug is required by the FDA to curtail or cease operations, or otherwise becomes inoperable, or a third party contract manufacturing facility faces manufacturing problems, obtaining the required FDA authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe FDA is authorized to perform inspections of U.S. and foreign facilities under the FFDCA. At the end of such an inspection, FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance of a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. FDA also may issue Warning Letters and untitled letters in connection with events or circumstances unrelated to an FDA inspection.\nSimilar to other healthcare companies, during 2016, our facilities, in multiple countries, across the full range of our business units, were subject to routine and new-product related inspections by the FDA, MHRA, HPRA and Health Canada. Some of these inspections resulted in non-critical inspection observations (including FDA Form 483 observations). We have responded to all inspection observations within the required time frame and have implemented, or are continuing to implement, the corrective action plans as agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies.\nMany of our core products contain controlled substances. The stringent DEA regulations on our use of controlled substances include restrictions on their use in research, manufacture, distribution and storage. A breach of these regulations could result in imposition of civil penalties, refusal to renew or action to revoke necessary registrations, or other restrictions on operations involving controlled substances. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects the manufacturing facilities of our subsidiaries and manufacturing partners to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown. Any such shutdown may adversely affect their ability to supply us with product and thus, our ability to market affected products. This could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and competitive position. See also the risk described under the caption \u201cThe DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.\u201d In addition, we are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). The U.S. government has enacted DSCSA which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\nWe cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations or requirements by the FDA or the courts, when and if promulgated or issued, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require different labeling, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, or limitations on product distribution. These changes, or others required by the FDA or DEA could have an adverse effect on the sales of these products. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that, from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.\nThe success of our acquisition and licensing strategy is subject to uncertainty and any completed acquisitions or licenses may reduce our earnings, be difficult to integrate, not perform as expected or require us to obtain additional financing.\nWe regularly evaluate selective acquisitions and look to continue to enhance our product line by acquiring rights to additional products and compounds. Such acquisitions may be carried out through corporate acquisitions, asset acquisitions, licensing and joint venture arrangements or by acquiring other companies. However, we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to complete acquisitions that meet our target criteria on satisfactory terms, if at all. In particular, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, any acquisition of assets and rights to products and compounds may fail to accomplish our strategic objective and may not perform as expected. Further, if we are unable to maintain, on commercially reasonable terms, product, compound or other licenses that we have acquired, our ability to develop or commercially exploit our products may be inhibited. In order to continue to develop and broaden our product range we must compete to acquire these assets. Our competitors may have greater resources than us and therefore be better able to complete acquisitions or may cause the ultimate price we pay for acquisitions to increase. If we fail to achieve our acquisition goals, our growth may be limited.\nIn addition to the risks related to acquisition of assets and products, acquisitions of companies may expose us to additional risks, which are beyond our control, and may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of an acquired business into our practices and operations. Any integration process may be disruptive and, if implemented ineffectively, may restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.\nIn addition, any acquisitions we make may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customer relationships. The difficulties of combining operations of companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination of the businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities or larger liabilities than projected, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nThe benefits of a merger are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business, the financial performance of the combined business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies, including changes in interest rates, and tax law of the jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be interrelated, and the impact to the combined company of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.\nIn addition, based on current acquisition prices in the pharmaceutical industry, acquisitions could decrease our net income per share and add significant intangible assets and related amortization or impairment charges. Our acquisition strategy may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing, resulting in leverage, increased debt obligations as compared to equity, or dilution of ownership. We may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us.\nWe may decide to sell assets, which could adversely affect our prospects and opportunities for growth.\nWe may from time to time consider selling certain assets if (i) we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or (ii) we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons, including for the reduction of indebtedness. We have explored and will continue to explore the sale of certain non-core assets. Although our expectation is to engage in asset sales only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy, any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and opportunities for growth, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth and development will depend on developing, commercializing and marketing new products, including both our own products and those developed with our collaboration partners. If we do not do so successfully, our growth and development will be impaired.\nOur future revenues and profitability will depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability to successfully commercialize new branded and generic pharmaceutical products protected by patent or statutory authority in a timely manner. As a result, we must continually develop, test and manufacture new products, which must meet regulatory standards to receive requisite marketing authorizations. Products we are currently developing may or may not receive the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary for us to market them. Furthermore, the development and commercialization process is time-consuming and costly, and we cannot confirm to you that any of our products, if and when developed and approved, can be successfully commercialized.\nIn addition, risks associated with developing, commercializing and marketing new products are beyond our control. For example, some of our collaboration partners may decide to make substantial changes to a product\u2019s formulation or design, may experience financial difficulties or may have limited financial resources. Any of the foregoing may delay the development, commercialization and/or marketing of new products. In addition, if a co-developer on a new product terminates our collaboration agreement or does not perform under the agreement, we may experience delays and additional costs in developing and marketing that product.\nWe conduct research and development of medical and technological products to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in accordance with specific government regulations. Much of our drug development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology. Typically, expenses related to research, development and regulatory approval of compounds for our branded pharmaceutical products are significantly greater than those expenses associated with generic products. As we continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in the healthcare industry, particularly with respect to new drugs, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful regulatory approval and introduction of new pharmaceutical products. Also, after we submit a regulatory application, the relevant governmental health authority may require that we conduct additional studies, including, studies to assess the product\u2019s interaction with alcohol. As a result, we may be unable to reasonably predict the total research and development costs to develop a particular product.\nThe availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided.\nOur ability to commercialize our products depends, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of these products is available from government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, private health insurers and others. We cannot be certain that, over time, third party reimbursements for our products will be adequate for us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment. Government payers, private insurers and other third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by (1) limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement (including adjusting co-pays) for products approved for marketing by the FDA, (2) refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval and (3) requiring or encouraging, through more favorable reimbursement levels or otherwise, the substitution of generic alternatives to branded products.\nWe may experience pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability.\nWe may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability. Recent events have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs, especially in connection with price increases following companies\u2019 acquisition of the rights to certain drug products. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices. In addition, the U.S. Senate is publicly investigating a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to drug-price increases and pricing practices. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.\nIn addition, in September 2016, a group of U.S. Senators introduced legislation that would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to justify price increases of more than 10% in a 12-month period, and a large number of individual States have introduced legislation aimed at drug pricing regulation, transparency or both. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected by the passage of these laws or similar federal or state legislation. Pressure from social activist groups and future government regulations may also put downward pressure on the price of drugs, which could result in downward pressure on the prices of our products in the future.\nOur business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us, our brands, and the safety and quality of our products, and may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings.\nMarket perceptions of us are very important to our business, especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, our partners and suppliers, or our brands suffer from negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFor example, the pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be potentially life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of API or no API at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nIn addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation. The inappropriate use of certain social media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information or the improper dissemination of material non-public information.\nWe are dependent on market perceptions, and negative publicity associated with product quality, patient illness, or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products, or our partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting the presentation (or the causing to be presented) of claims for payment (by Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers) that are determined to be false or fraudulent, including presenting a claim for an item or service that was not provided. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which permits private persons to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false or fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. These actions against pharmaceutical companies, which do not require proof of a specific intent to defraud the government, may result in payment of fines to and/or administrative exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and/or other government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to laws that require us to enter into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement and a 340B Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement as a condition for having our products eligible for payment under Medicare Part B and Medicaid. We have entered into such agreements. In addition, we are required to report certain pricing information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a periodic basis to allow for accurate determination of rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, of ceiling prices under the 340B program and certain other government pricing arrangements, and of reimbursement rates for certain drugs paid under Medicare Part B. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued a Final Rule implementing the Medicaid Drug Rebate provisions incorporated into the PPACA, effective April 1, 2016 in most instances. Implementation of the Final Rule required operational adjustments by us in order to maintain compliance with applicable law. Changes included in the Final Rule revised how manufacturers calculate Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and Best Price and also affect the quarterly amounts that we owe to state Medicaid programs through the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Also, CMS made changes with respect to how certain products are categorized for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program (i.e., single source, innovator multiple source, or non-innovator multiple source), which could affect the rebate calculation methodology, and thus the level of rebates incurred for affected products. In addition, CMS finalized its proposal to change the reimbursement metrics upon which Medicaid agencies are required to reimburse for covered outpatient drugs. The new reimbursement structure could adversely affect providers\u2019 reimbursement for our products, and thus could adversely affect sales of our products. The Final Rule also expanded the scope of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to apply to U.S. Territories, effective April 1, 2020, which will require operational adjustments and may result in additional rebate liability. Finally, CMS withdrew its proposed definition of \u201cline extension\u201d set forth in the 2012 proposed rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and opened a new 60-day comment period soliciting views on how to interpret the relevant PPACA provisions. Additional operational adjustments and financial implications may result upon CMS\u2019 finalization of \u201cline extension\u201d provisions.\nWe and other pharmaceutical companies have been defendants in a number of lawsuits filed by various government entities, alleging generally that we and numerous other pharmaceutical companies reported false pricing information in connection with certain drugs that are reimbursable by state Medicaid programs, which are partially funded by the federal government. There is a risk the Company will be subject to similar investigations or litigations in the future and that the Company will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that the Company will enter into monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere is additional uncertainty surrounding the healthcare insurance coverage mandate that went into effect in the U.S. in 2015 and continued into 2016. Employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients\u2019 ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions could lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies, or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. Such changes may result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.\nOur customer concentration may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe primarily sell our products to a limited number of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains. In turn, these wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains supply products to pharmacies, hospitals, governmental agencies and physicians. In addition, this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains. We expect that consolidation of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on pharmaceutical companies, including us. Total revenues from customers who accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the three years ended December 31 are as follows:\nRevenues from these customers are included within our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals segments. If we were to lose the business of any of these customers, or if any were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our total revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are currently dependent on outside manufacturers for the manufacture of a significant amount of our products; therefore, we have and will continue to have limited control of the manufacturing process and related costs. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of one or more of our products.\nThird party manufacturers currently manufacture a significant amount of our products pursuant to contractual arrangements. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of our products. For example, Teikoku is our sole source of Lidoderm\u00ae and Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH (Gr\u00fcnenthal) is our sole source for one of our formulations of OPANA\u00ae ER. Because of contractual restraints and the lead-time necessary to obtain FDA approval, and possibly DEA registration, of a new manufacturer, replacement of any of these manufacturers may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in our supply of products to customers. As a result, any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause many of our products are manufactured by third parties, we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process or costs related to the process. Increases in the prices we pay our manufacturers, interruptions in our supply of products or lapses in quality could adversely impact our margins, profitability and cash flows. We are reliant on our third party manufacturers to maintain the facilities at which they manufacture our products in compliance with FDA, DEA, state and local regulations. If they fail to maintain compliance with FDA, DEA or other critical regulations, they could be ordered to cease manufacturing, or product may be recalled, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, if any facility that manufactures our products experiences a natural disaster, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to FDA and DEA regulation, violation of standards enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and their counterpart agencies at the state level could slow down or curtail operations of third party manufacturers.\nIn addition, we may consider entering into additional manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers. In each case, we will incur significant costs in obtaining the regulatory approvals and taking other necessary steps to begin commercial production by these manufacturers. If the market for the products manufactured by these third parties substantially contracts or disappears, we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts. Such an obligation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products. In addition, we rely on third party suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, customer service support, medical affairs services, clinical studies, sales and other technical and financial services. All third party suppliers and contractors are subject to FDA, and very often DEA, requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply of goods and services by these third party suppliers, the regulatory compliance of these third parties, and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers, distributors and collaboration partners. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we have entered into minimum purchase requirement contracts with some of our third party raw material suppliers. If the market for the products that utilize these raw materials substantially contracts or disappears, we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts and meeting such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon third parties to provide us with various estimates as a basis for our financial reporting. While we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information, we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accounting methods and controls over the information provided to us by third parties. As a result, we are at risk of them providing us with erroneous data which could have a material adverse impact on our business and or reporting.\nIf our manufacturing facilities are unable to manufacture our products or the manufacturing process is interrupted due to failure to comply with regulations or for other reasons, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf any of our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with regulatory requirements or encounter other manufacturing difficulties, it could adversely affect our ability to supply products. All facilities and manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are subject to inspection by regulatory agencies at any time and must be operated in conformity with cGMP and, in the case of controlled substances, DEA regulations. Compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP and DEA requirements applies to both drug products seeking regulatory approval and to approved drug products. In complying with cGMP requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must continually expend significant time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality assurance and control so that their products meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety, efficacy and quality. Failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects our manufacturing facilities to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown, which may adversely affect our ability to supply the product. Were we not able to manufacture products at our manufacturing facilities because of regulatory, business or any other reasons, the manufacture and marketing of these products would be interrupted. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, cash flows and competitive position.\nFor example, our Horsham facility and the facilities of the manufacturer that we are in the process of qualifying as an alternate manufacturer for XIAFLEX\u00ae (such manufacturer, the \u201cProposed Alternate Manufacturer\u201d and such facility, the \u201cProposed Alternate Facility\u201d) are subject to such regulatory requirements and oversight. If we or the Proposed Alternate Manufacturer fail to comply with cGMP requirements, we may not be permitted to sell our products or may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell them. Further, if an inspection by regulatory authorities indicates that there are deficiencies, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, we could be required to take remedial actions, stop production or close our Horsham facility or the Proposed Alternate Facility, which would disrupt the manufacturing processes, limit the supplies of XIAFLEX\u00ae and delay clinical trials and subsequent licensure, and/or limit the sale of commercial supplies. In addition, future noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements may result in refusal by regulatory authorities to allow use of XIAFLEX\u00ae in clinical trials, refusal of the government to allow distribution of XIAFLEX\u00ae within the U.S. or other jurisdictions, criminal prosecution and fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products, refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts, and follow-on civil litigation.\nThe DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.\nThe DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. The active ingredients in some of our current products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, morphine, fentanyl, and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, generally, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nFurthermore, the DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development and sets a quota on the production of these products. We, or our contract manufacturing organizations, must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain these substances and produce our products. As a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quotas, or modification of our quotas, for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel, and continue to attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have consulting agreements with certain key individuals and institutions and have employment agreements with our key executives, we cannot confirm to you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nThe trading prices of our securities may be volatile, and your investment in our securities could decline in value.\nThe market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, in 2016, our ordinary shares traded between $12.56 and $61.14 per share on the NASDAQ. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may cause the market value of our securities to fluctuate:\n\u2022\nFDA approval or disapproval of any of the drug applications we have submitted;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nnew data or new analyses of older data that raises potential safety or effectiveness issues concerning our approved products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\ncompetitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of generic substitutes for our products, including the filing of ANDAs with respect to generic versions of our branded products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our or others\u2019 proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u2022\ncompetitors\u2019 publicity regarding actual or potential products under development or other activities affecting our competitors or the industry in general;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nnew legislation in the U.S. relating to the development, sale or pricing of pharmaceutical products or changes in interpretation of existing legislation relating thereto;\n\u2022\na determination by a regulatory agency that we are engaging or have engaged in inappropriate sales or marketing activities, including promoting the \u201coff-label\u201d use of our products;\n\u2022\nsocial and political pressure to lower the cost of drugs;\n\u2022\nsocial and political scrutiny over increases in prices of shares of pharmaceutical companies that are perceived to be caused by a strategy of growth through acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlitigation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the political and regulatory environment and international relations as a result of events such as the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit) and the new U.S. administration and other external factors, including market speculation or disasters and other crises.\nOur operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail, if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades or if we are subject to cyber-attacks.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and networks, hardware and software systems and our other information technology. We collect and maintain information, which includes confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, viruses, worms and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. In addition, we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyber-attacks. If our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems, our operations and financial results could suffer.\nWe also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, some of which are outside the U.S., including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions. The size and complexity of our and our vendors\u2019 systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties.\nThe Company and its vendors\u2019 sophisticated information technology operations are spread across multiple, sometimes inconsistent platforms, which pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity across systems. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional or improper dissemination or destruction of confidential information stored in the Company\u2019s systems.\nForeign regulatory requirements vary, including with respect to the regulatory approval process, and failure to obtain regulatory approval or maintain compliance with requirements in foreign jurisdictions would prevent or impact the marketing of our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe have worldwide intellectual property rights to market many of our products and product candidates and intend to seek approval to market certain of our products outside of the U.S. Approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing that product in those countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval set forth herein. Approval by the FDA does not secure approval by the regulatory authorities of any other country, nor does the approval by foreign regulatory authorities in one country secure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or the FDA.\nOutside of the U.S., regulatory agencies generally evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products and devices and impose regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards, among others. These requirements vary across jurisdiction. In certain countries, including emerging and developing markets, the applicable health care and drug regulatory regimes are continuing to evolve and new requirements may be implemented. Ensuring and maintaining compliance with these evolving requirements is and will continue to be difficult, time-consuming and costly. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to generate revenue from abroad will be adversely affected.\nOur Astora subsidiary could be adversely affected by special risks and requirements related to its previous business of manufacturing medical products.\nOur Astora subsidiary is subject to various risks and requirements associated with it previously being a medical equipment manufacturer, which could have adverse effects. These include the following:\n\u2022\npotential and actual product liability claims for any defective or allegedly defective goods that are distributed; and\n\u2022\nincreased government scrutiny and/or potential claims regarding the marketing of medical devices.\nWe are subject to health information privacy and data protection laws that include penalties for noncompliance.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly our business. This includes federal and state laws and regulations in the United States as well as in Europe and other markets. There has also been increased enforcement activity in the United States particularly related to data security breaches. A violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to penalties, fines and/or possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid. Such sanctions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe expanding nature of our business in global markets exposes us to risks associated with adapting to emerging markets and taking advantage of growth opportunities.\nThe globalization of our business, including in Latin America, South Africa and Canada, may expose us to increased risks associated with conducting business in emerging markets. Any difficulties in adapting to emerging markets could impair our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in these regions and a decline in the growth of emerging markets could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe expansion of our activities in emerging markets may further expose us to more volatile economic conditions and political instability. We also face competition from companies that are already well established in these markets. Our inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of these markets, particularly with respect to their regulatory frameworks, the difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels and corruption and fraud, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur policies and procedures, which are designed to help us, our employees and agents comply with various laws and regulations regarding corrupt practices and anti-bribery, cannot guarantee protection against liability for actions taken by businesses in which we invest. Failure to comply with domestic or international laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in the approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, or the imposition of criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.\nIn addition, differences in banking systems and business cultures could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting matters. Given the significant learning curve to fully understand the emerging markets\u2019 business, operating environment and the quality of controls in place, we may not be able to adequately assess the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting or the effects of the laws and requirements of the local business jurisdictions.\nMany jurisdictions require specific permits or business licenses, particularly if the business is considered foreign. These requirements may affect our ability to carry out our business operations in emerging markets.\nOur international operations could expose us to various risks, including risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn 2016, 7.0% of our total revenues were from sources outside the U.S. Some of these sales were to governmental entities and other organizations with extended payment terms. A number of factors, including differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax regimes, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political or economic instability in the countries where we do business, could affect payment terms and our ability to collect foreign receivables. We have little influence over these factors and changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. In particular, the risk of a debt default by one or more European countries and related European or national financial restructuring efforts may cause volatility in the value of the Euro. In addition, foreign sales are influenced by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the Canadian dollar, Euro, South African rand, Mexican peso, British pound and Australian dollar.\nWe face risks relating to the expected exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a remain-or-leave referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership within the European Union, the result of which favored the Brexit. A process of negotiation will likely determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, as well as whether the United Kingdom will be able to continue to benefit from the European Union\u2019s free trade and similar agreements. The timing of the Brexit and potential impact of Brexit on our market share, sales, profitability and results of operations is unclear. Depending on the terms of Brexit, economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and global markets may be adversely affected by reduced growth and volatility. The uncertainty before, during and after the period of negotiation is also expected to have a negative economic impact and increase volatility in the markets, particularly in the Eurozone. Such volatility and negative economic impact could, in turn, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe risks of selling and shipping products and of purchasing products across international borders may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders is subject to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, such as various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export control laws, customs and import laws, and anti-boycott laws. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including, but not limited to, imprisonment of individuals, fines, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities.\nIn addition, some countries in which our subsidiaries sell products are, to some degree, subject to political, economic and/or social instability. Our non-U.S. sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and non-U.S. governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability or disruptions, including local and regional instability, or disruptions due to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, disruptions due to civil unrest and hostilities, rioting, military activity, terror attacks or armed hostilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nforeign tax authorities imposing significant fines, penalties and additional taxes;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in several foreign countries.\nWe cannot provide assurance that one or more of these factors will not harm our business. Additionally, we are experiencing fluidity in regulatory and pricing trends as a result of the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Any material decrease in our non-U.S. sales would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, which may require us to refinance all or part of our then outstanding indebtedness. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we have total debt of approximately $8.40 billion in aggregate principal amount. Our substantial indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of rising interest rates with respect to the borrowings under our credit facility, which are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, which will depend on the conditions of the markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways, a default of which may result in acceleration of certain of our indebtedness.\nWe are subject to various covenants in the instruments governing our debt that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u2022make loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, terminate all commitments to extend further credit, enforce liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting the debt and pursue other legal remedies. The instruments governing our debt contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions that may cause all of the debt issued under such instruments to become immediately due and payable as a result of a default under an unrelated debt instrument. An event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of other debt agreements. We cannot confirm to you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if the obligations thereunder were accelerated upon an event of default. We may need to conduct asset sales or elect to pursue other alternatives, including proceedings under applicable insolvency laws relating to some or all of our business. Any or all of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial conditions and operations. For a description of our indebtedness, see Note 13. Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report \"Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\".\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Paladin transaction.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). A corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 provides an exception pursuant to which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nUnder Section 7874, we would be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the former shareholders of EHSI owned immediately after the Paladin transaction (within the meaning of Section 7874) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of Endo shares by reason of holding shares in EHSI (the ownership test). The former EHSI shareholders owned less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the shares in Endo after the Paladin merger by reason of their ownership of shares in EHSI. As a result, under current law, we are expected to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code, including with respect to the provisions regarding the application of the ownership test. Our obligation to complete the Paladin transactions was conditional upon its receipt of a Section 7874 opinion from our counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (Skadden), dated as of the closing date of the Paladin transaction and subject to certain qualifications and limitations set forth therein, to the effect that Section 7874 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder should not apply in such a manner so as to cause Endo to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes from and after the closing date. However, an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or a court. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a position contrary to Skadden\u2019s Section 7874 opinion or that a court will not agree with the IRS in the event of litigation.\nThe effective rate of taxation upon our results of operations is dependent on multi-national tax considerations.\nWe earn a portion of our income outside the United States. That portion of our earnings is taxed at the more favorable rates applicable to the activities undertaken by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits, and repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries for which we have not provided for taxes. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We are subject to the examination of our tax returns and tax arrangements by the IRS and other tax and governmental authorities. For example, our transfer pricing has been the subject of IRS audits, and may be the subject of future audits by the IRS or other tax authorities, and we may be subject to tax assessments or the reallocation of income among our subsidiaries. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions, which are subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.\nFuture changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect us.\nUnder current law, we are expected to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, changes to the rules in Section 7874 of the Code or regulations promulgated thereunder or other guidance issued by the Treasury or the IRS could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us, EHSI, and/or their respective shareholders and affiliates. Consequently, there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the future a change in law that might cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including with retroactive effect.\nIn addition, recent U.S. legislative proposals would expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and limit deductibility of interest and/or other payments made by our U.S. subsidiaries to non-U.S. persons from which we currently benefit. If such a change in law were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nFurther, the U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations and there are several current legislative proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase our effective tax rate, materially adversely impacting our financial statements and cash flows from operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain our low tax rates, which could adversely affect our businesses and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and also maintain subsidiaries in, amongst other jurisdictions, the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and South Africa. The IRS and other taxing authorities may challenge intercompany arrangements. Responding to or defending such a challenge could be expensive, consume time and other resources, and divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging our tax positions, the cost involved in responding to and defending any such audit and resulting litigation, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses, decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial statements, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur ability to use U.S. tax attributes to offset U.S. taxable income may be limited.\nExisting and future tax laws and regulations may limit our ability to use U.S. tax attributes, including net operating losses, to offset U.S. taxable income. For a period of time following the 2014 Paladin transaction, Section 7874 precludes our U.S. affiliates from utilizing U.S. tax attributes to offset taxable income if we complete certain transactions with related non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department recently issued new temporary and proposed regulations related to corporate inversions and earnings stripping. The limitations on the use of certain tax attributes and deductions in these regulations are in addition to existing rules that could impose more restrictive limitations in the event that cumulative changes in our stock ownership within a three-year period exceed certain thresholds. Such changes or the adoption of additional limitations could impact our overall utilization of deferred tax assets, potentially resulting in a material adverse impact to our financial statements and cash flows from operations.\nAny attempts to take us over will be subject to Irish Takeover Rules and subject to review by the Irish Takeover Panel.\nWe are subject to Irish Takeover Rules, under which our board of directors (Board of Directors) will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once it has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent.\nIf pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative, regulatory and other efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.\nMany pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included:\n\u2022\npursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents, which could extend patent protection for additional years;\n\u2022\nusing the Citizen Petition process (e.g., under 21 C.F.R. s. 10.30) to request amendments to FDA standards;\n\u2022\nattempting to use the legislative and regulatory process to have drugs reclassified or rescheduled or to set definitions of abuse deterrent formulations to protect brand company patents and profits; and\n\u2022\nengaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs.\nIf pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means, our sales of generic products may decline. If we experience a material decline in generic product sales, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will suffer.\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing biologic products and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing processes, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or delay or disrupt manufacture of those of our products that are reliant upon our manufacturing operations.\nThe manufacture of biologic products requires significant expertise and capital investment. Although our subsidiary, Auxilium, leased its facilities in Horsham, Pennsylvania in order to have direct control over the manufacturing of the active ingredient of XIAFLEX\u00ae, we have limited experience in manufacturing XIAFLEX\u00ae or any other biologic product. Biologics such as XIAFLEX\u00ae require processing steps that are highly complex and generally more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. In addition, TESTOPEL\u00ae is manufactured using a unique, proprietary process. If our manufacturing processes at the Rye, New York facility or Horsham facility are disrupted, it may be difficult to find alternate manufacturing sites. We may encounter difficulties with the manufacture of the active ingredient of XIAFLEX\u00ae or TESTOPEL\u00ae, which could delay, disrupt or halt our manufacture of XIAFLEX\u00ae and TESTOPEL\u00ae, respectively, require write-offs which may affect our financial results, result in product recalls or product liability claims or otherwise materially affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88436, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ENDP"}
