{"cik": "1637655", "company": "Horizon Global Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. These risks and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business, which could result in a material adverse impact to our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in China and has since spread to other parts of the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak. Along with these declarations, extraordinary and wide-ranging actions were taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including quarantines, social distancing and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, mandatory business closures and other mandates that substantially restricted individuals\u2019 daily activities and curtailed or ceased many businesses\u2019 normal operations.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in demand and customer orders for our products in all sales channels, as well as temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities due to decreased demand and government mandates. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted various aspects of the supply chain as our suppliers experience similar business disruptions due to operating restrictions from government mandates. We continue to monitor procurement of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products, but continued disruptions in the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic may cause difficulty in sourcing materials or unexpected shortages or delays in delivery of raw materials and components, and may result in increased costs in our supply chain. We have implemented plans to reduce spending in certain areas of our business, including flexing variable labor, involuntary leave programs, reductions or delays in variable costs and investments, including capital expenditures, and may need to take additional actions to reduce spending in the future.\nGenerally, government restrictions have been lifted and economies have reopened; however, certain jurisdictions or regions may have to re-establish restrictions due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases or otherwise, which could require us, our customers or our suppliers to close or limit operations. Accordingly, the ultimate shape of the economic recovery is uncertain. We will continue to closely monitor and assess the impact of the pandemic on our business, the extent of the impact on our liquidity to meet our short-term obligations and fund our business needs and growth, and our ability to meet financial covenants within our credit agreements. While we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near- and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted, including: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including the resurgence of COVID-19 cases; (b) rapidly-changing governmental and public health mandates and guidance to contain and combat the outbreak; (c) the extent and duration of the pandemic\u2019s adverse effect on economic and social activity, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may reduce demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us; (d) our ability to sell and provide our services and products, including as a result of any restrictions, mandatory business closures, and any stay-at home or similar orders; (e) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; (f) the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could result in terminations of contracts, losses of revenue, and further adverse effects to our supply chain; (g) any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets, which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; and (h) the potential effects on our internal controls, including as a result of changes in working environments and observing stay-at-home and similar orders that are applicable to our employees and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Economic Conditions\nOur businesses depend upon general economic conditions, and we serve some customers in highly cyclical industries; as such, we may be subject to the loss of sales and margins due to an economic downturn or recession.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve in both the U.S. and global economies. Some of the industries that we serve are highly cyclical, such as the agricultural, automotive, construction, horse/livestock, industrial, marine, military, recreational, trailer and utility markets. We may experience a reduction in sales and margins as a result of a downturn in economic conditions or other macroeconomic factors. Lower demand for our products may also negatively affect the capacity utilization of our production facilities, which may further reduce our operating margins.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nMany of the markets we serve are highly competitive, which could limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins.\nMany of our products are sold in competitive markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality and price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, reliability and timeliness of delivery, customer service and effectiveness of distribution. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require our continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support of our distribution networks. We may have insufficient resources in the future to continue to make such investments and, even if we make such investments, we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position. We also face the risk of lower-cost foreign manufacturers located in China, Southeast Asia, India and other regions competing in the markets for our products, and we may be driven as a consequence of this competition to increase our investment overseas. Making overseas investments can be highly complicated and we may not always realize the advantages we anticipate from any such investments. Competitive pressure may limit the volume of products that we sell and reduce our operating margins.\nWe may not achieve our strategic goals for margin expansion, liquidity management and organic growth. Our past performance in these areas may not be indicative of future performance. Failure to achieve our strategic goals may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur strategic platforms for value creation and goals for margin expansion, liquidity management and organic growth are subject to risk and uncertainty and depend on general economic, credit, capital market and other conditions that are beyond our control and are subject to fluctuation. Our past performance with respect to margin expansion, liquidity management and organic growth should be considered independent from, and may not be a reliable indicator of, future performance. These strategic goals may need to be revised or may not be met for a number of reasons, including changes in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in credit and capital market conditions, increased competition in the markets for our products, increases in raw material or energy costs and changes in technology and manufacturing techniques.\nIncreases in our raw material or energy costs or the loss of critical suppliers could adversely affect our profitability and other financial results.\nWe are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper and aluminum. The prices for these products have historically been volatile, fluctuate with worldwide market and economic conditions, import duties and tariffs, and may increase as a result of various factors, including: a reduction in the number of suppliers due to restructuring, bankruptcies and consolidations, declining supply due to mine or mill closures and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability, including increases in supplier operating expenses caused by rising raw material and energy costs. We may be unable to completely offset the impact with price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to our customers, competitive considerations or our customers\u2019 resistance to accepting such price increases and our financial performance may be adversely impacted by further price increases. A failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with certain raw materials or component parts on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, for any reason, including, without limitation, disruptions in our suppliers\u2019 business due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), fires or other natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent there are energy supply disruptions or material fluctuations in energy costs, our margins could be materially adversely impacted.\nIn the past, the United States government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to trade policy, including, in some instances, to revise, renegotiate or terminate certain multilateral trade agreements and has also imposed new tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing additional increases or new tariffs on other goods. Such actions have, in some cases, led to retaliatory trade measures by certain foreign governments. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or procure products from those countries. In turn, we may need to raise prices or make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our revenue or operating results. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. government or foreign governments with respect to tariff and international trade agreements and policies, and we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any revised trade agreements or any impact on our business.\nTransportation disruptions or increases in our freight cost could adversely affect our profitability and other financial results.\nBecause certain of our products are procured from international sources, including China, and imported into our manufacturing and distribution center locations around the world, if disruptions in our transportation network occur or our shipping costs substantially increase, we may be unable to sell or timely deliver our products, and our operating expenses could increase. We are dependent upon the transportation systems we use to ship our products, including various transportation modes of freight such as land, water and air. Our attempts to closely match our inventory levels to our product demand intensify the need for our transportation systems to function effectively and without delay.\nThe transportation network is subject to disruption or congestion from a variety of causes, including labor disputes or port strikes, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, and congestion resulting from higher shipping volumes. A port worker strike, work slow-down, or other transportation disruption in Long Beach, California, where we generally import our products to fulfill certain of our Horizon Americas operating segment orders, could significantly disrupt our business. Our international freight is regularly subjected to inspection by governmental entities. If our delivery times increase unexpectedly for these or any other reasons, our ability to deliver products on time would be materially adversely affected and result in delayed or lost revenue as well as customer imposed penalties. In addition, if increases in fuel prices occur, our transportation costs would likely increase. Moreover, the cost of shipping our products by air freight is greater than other methods. From time to time, we have shipped products using air freight to meet unexpected spikes and shifts in demand between product categories, to bring new product introductions to market quickly and to timely ship products previously ordered. If we rely more heavily upon air freight to deliver our products, our overall shipping costs will increase. A prolonged transportation disruption or a significant increase in the cost of freight could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products are typically highly engineered or customer-driven and we are subject to risks associated with changing technology and manufacturing techniques that could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our success depends on our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing expectations with respect to these criteria. We anticipate that we will remain committed to product research and development, advanced manufacturing techniques and service to remain competitive, which entails significant costs. We may be unable to address technological advances, implement new and more cost-effective manufacturing techniques, or introduce new or improved products, whether in existing or new markets, so as to maintain our businesses\u2019 competitive positions or to grow our businesses as desired.\nA portion of our sales is derived from international sources, which exposes us to certain risks which may adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nWe have operations outside of the United States. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 43.9% of our net sales were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States. In addition, we may expand our international operations through internal growth and acquisitions. International operations, particularly sales to emerging markets and manufacturing in non-U.S. countries, are subject to risks which are not present within U.S. markets, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in local government regulations and policies including, but not limited to, governmental embargoes, repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property, duty or tariff restrictions, investment limitations and tax policies;\n\u2022changes in local economic conditions;\n\u2022political and economic instability and disruptions, including labor unrest, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022legislation that regulates the use of chemicals;\n\u2022disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d);\n\u2022compliance with international trade laws and regulations, including import and export control and economic sanctions, such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties, and/or government authorities that may question our international trade and/or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that may impact our business, financial results or operating cash flows;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash flow from non-U.S. subsidiaries that could affect our financial results and reduce our ability to service debt;\n\u2022reduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022increasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation;\n\u2022the impacts related to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union; and\n\u2022other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas where our operations are conducted.\nWe are also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on import from countries where we procure or manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For instance, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported goods. With respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel, aluminum and automotive components, with China imposing retaliatory tariffs on certain automotive components. Given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs by the United States, China or other countries, as well as other changes in tax policy, trade regulations or trade agreements, and the Company\u2019s ability to implement strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in tax policy, tariffs or other trade regulations, our exposure to the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are impacted by the movement of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the countries in which we generate sales and conduct operations. Long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect on operations and financial conditions. Additionally, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial condition.\nA future impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill could have a material negative impact on our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our intangible assets and goodwill were $58.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Intangibles and goodwill each represented 13% and 1% of our total assets, respectively. If we experience declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our current and forecasted operating budget, we may be subject to future impairment charges. Because of the significance of these assets, any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nWe depend on the services of key individuals, the loss of which could materially harm us.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management. Our future success will also depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract, develop and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be subject to further unionization and work stoppages at our facilities or our customers may be subject to work stoppages, which could seriously impact the profitability of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 58% of our work force was unionized under several different unions. We are not aware of any present active union organizing drives at any of our other facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Future labor disagreements could result in work stoppages. Any prolonged work stoppages at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our direct or indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are included. In addition, organizations responsible for shipping our customers\u2019 products may be impacted by occasional strikes or other activity. Any interruption in the delivery of our customers\u2019 products could reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur healthcare costs for active employees and future retirees may exceed our projections and may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe provide healthcare benefits for active employees through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions, all of which are subject to various cost-sharing features. If our costs under our benefit programs for active employees exceed our projections, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, foreign competitors and many domestic competitors provide fewer benefits to their employees, and this difference in cost could adversely impact our competitive position.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nWe may face liability associated with the use of products for which patent ownership or other intellectual property rights are claimed.\nWe may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding alleged unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s intellectual property. An adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or using certain products or brands, or require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand certain products or packaging, any of which could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the cost of responding to an intellectual property infringement claim, in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources, whether or not the claim is valid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWhile we believe that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value, it is uncertain that this intellectual property or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future, will provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Our patents or pending applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors or rights granted thereunder may not provide meaningful proprietary protection. Moreover, competitors may infringe on our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to, or have the resources to, prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States. The cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total gross debt of $266.1 million (without giving effect to the equity component of our convertible senior notes or any debt discount). Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on acceptable terms and conditions to enable us to react to changes in our business; or\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.\nAdditionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our new term loan restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our new term loan contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our new term loan require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Although we entered into amendments to the agreements governing our debt in recent years to, among other things, provide for a relaxation of certain of our financial covenants, our ability to meet the financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under agreements governing our revolving credit facility and our new term loan could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility and our new term loan, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nOur access to new capital may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.\nAs part of our ongoing business, we are exposed to certain market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates and uncertainty regarding Federal Reserve policies. An increase in interest rates may result in tighter capital markets, increasing the cost and reducing the availability of debt financing. Restricted access to debt financing could impact that availability of working capital and may adversely affect us.\nWe have significant operating lease obligations and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe lease many of our manufacturing facilities and certain capital equipment. Our rent expense in 2020 under these operating leases was $15.0 million. A failure to pay our rental obligations would constitute a default allowing the applicable landlord to pursue any remedy available to it under applicable law, which would include taking possession of our property and, in the case of real property, evicting us. These leases are categorized as operating leases and are not considered indebtedness for purposes of our debt instruments.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, recall and warranty claims that may be brought against us.\nA significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us could adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, regardless of fault, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or we may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Further, any product liability or warranty issues may adversely affect our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products, divert management\u2019s attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability, warranty claims and product recall. However, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise and any liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have been able to obtain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate to cover such liability to date, our insurance premiums may increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business generally or our situation in particular. Any such increase could result in lower net income or cause the need to reduce our insurance coverage. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to certain state laws, may not be covered by insurance. Our product liability insurance policies have limits that, if exceeded, may result in material costs that could have an adverse effect on our future profitability. In addition, warranty claims are generally not covered by our product liability insurance.\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels, and existing and any new laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management, could affect our general business operations. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.\nWhile we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. We cannot assess the financial or operational impact of future regulatory changes; however, future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation, could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes to federal, state, and local tax laws due to changes in compliance requirements. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to income taxes, indirect taxes (such as excise, sales & use, and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, and property taxes. Tax laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of existing laws are issued and applied. The activity could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Cybersecurity\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products.\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to U.S. or international privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to compromise from advanced persistent threats, employee malfeasance, human or technological error, and other cybersecurity threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, customer relationships, competitiveness and results of operations. We may be required to incur significant costs to remedy damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches or to protect against disruption or security breaches in the future. We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available, or may result in increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums.\nA major disruption or failure of our information systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business. We may experience operating problems with our information systems as a result of system disruptions, failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause customers to cancel orders or cause standard business processes to become inefficient or ineffective. An extended interruption of standard business processes may affect our profitability and financial position.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off\nWe remain subject to continuing indemnification liabilities in connection with the Spin-off.\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement with TriMas that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to affect the Spin-off, certain conditions to the Spin-off and provisions governing the relationship between our company and TriMas with respect to and resulting from the Spin-off. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our Cequent business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-off, as well as those obligations of TriMas assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify TriMas under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nMoreover, pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, TriMas agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that TriMas has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from TriMas will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that TriMas will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from TriMas any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these liabilities ourselves. If TriMas is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, TriMas\u2019 insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the Spin-off. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers, we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage.\nPotential liabilities associated with certain assumed obligations under the tax sharing agreement cannot be precisely quantified at this time.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement with TriMas, we are responsible generally for certain taxes paid after the Spin-off attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the Spin-off. We have also agreed to be responsible for, and to indemnify TriMas with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the Spin-off (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes (which could result, for example, from a merger or other transaction involving an acquisition of our shares) to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the tax opinion relating to the Spin-off or in the tax sharing agreement. As described above, such tax liability would be calculated as though TriMas (or its affiliate) had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value, and TriMas (or its affiliate) would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares. Any such tax liability could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Convertible Notes\nWhile we are currently in compliance with the NYSE's minimum market capitalization requirement, we could be at risk of being out of compliance and of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOn April 30, 2020, we were notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because our average market capitalization was less than $50 million over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million. We submitted a plan to the NYSE indicating our intention to seek to cure the market capitalization condition by executing a strategic plan, which resulted in improved operational and financial performance that ultimately led to a recovery of our common stock price and market capitalization and our once again being in compliance with the minimum market capitalization requirement. While we have cured this deficiency and regained compliance with this continued listing standard, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with this and other continued listing standards of the NYSE.\nA delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and negatively impact our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing.\nOur issuance of any additional shares of our common stock, including pursuant to the exercise of instruments convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock, or the issuance of additional instruments convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn February 2017, we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). The Convertible Notes may be settled in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option. In the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. The Convertible Notes issuance, and any future issuance of shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable into, shares of our common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of a term loan in 2019, we issued detachable warrants to purchase up to 6.25 million shares of our common stock, which can be exercised on a cashless basis over a five-year term with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. In addition, in connection with the issuance of our new term loan in February 2021, we issued detachable warrants to purchase up to 3.91 million shares of our common stock, which can be exercised on a cashless basis over a five-year term with an exercise price of $9.00 per share. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nIn particular, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes upon exercise and settlement or termination of the warrants that we entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering and term loans, and upon the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock awards and deferred restricted stock units to our employees. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nThe conditional conversion features of our Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes are triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the conversion rate, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge transactions (\u201cConvertible Note Hedges\u201d) and warrant transactions (\u201cWarrants\u201d) that we entered into in connection with the offering of our Convertible Notes may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. The Convertible Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, each option counterparty or an affiliate thereof may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes. In addition, if any such Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants fail to become effective, each option counterparty may unwind its hedge position with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Convertible Notes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy laws, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such allegations, violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance, could damage our reputation and could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOur stock price may be subject to significant volatility due to our own results or market trends.\nIf our revenue, earnings or cash flows in any quarter fail to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations, there could be an immediate negative impact on our stock price. Our stock price could also be impacted by broader market trends and world events unrelated to our performance.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or our \u201ccertificate of incorporation,\u201d and Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our \u201cbylaws,\u201d as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. These provisions, among other things, establish that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board and establish advance notice requirements for nomination of candidates for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares of common stock. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of our common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages that large accumulations of common stock might provide.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we will also be subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 203 prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder was approved in advance by our board of directors, results in the stockholder holding more than 85% of our voting stock, subject to certain restrictions, or is approved at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock not held by the stockholder engaging in the transaction.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15399, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "HZN"}
