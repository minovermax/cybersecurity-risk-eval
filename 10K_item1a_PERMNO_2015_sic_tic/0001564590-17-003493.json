RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us; however, they may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may become important and may result in harm to our business.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Korlym\nWe depend heavily on the success of Korlym\u00ae. If we are unable to increase revenue from the sale of Korlym to the levels investors expect, or experience significant delays in doing so, our stock price will likely decline.\nWe anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenue and fund our commercial operations and development programs will be solely dependent on the successful commercialization of Korlym. Many factors could hamper our efforts to commercialize Korlym, including:\n\u2022\nan inability to generate sufficient revenue due to low product usage or inadequate insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\ncompetition from Novartis\u2019s Signifor and from other companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours;\n\u2022\nan inability to manufacture Korlym or the active ingredient in Korlym in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost;\n\u2022\npolitical concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone that could limit the market acceptance of Korlym;\n\u2022\npreviously unknown, serious side effects that may be identified; and\n\u2022\nrapid technological change that makes Korlym obsolete.\nFailure to meet investors\u2019 revenue expectations could cause our stock price to decline.\nPhysicians may accept Korlym slowly or may never accept it, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nPhysicians will prescribe Korlym only if they determine that it is preferable to other treatments, even if those products are not approved for Cushing syndrome. Because Cushing syndrome is rare, most physicians are inexperienced in the care of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe Korlym, even with clinical trial results that show it is a compelling treatment.\nOther factors that may affect the commercial success of Korlym include:\n\u2022\nthe preference of some physicians for more familiar, long-standing off-label treatments for Cushing syndrome or for Novartis\u2019 drug, Signifor, for the treatment of Cushing disease;\n\u2022\ncompetition from alternative treatment methods, such as surgery and radiation therapy;\n\u2022\nthe cost-effectiveness of Korlym and the availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe product labeling required by the FDA for Korlym; and\n\u2022\nnegative publicity concerning Korlym, RU-486, Mifeprex\u00ae or mifepristone.\nThe failure of Korlym to achieve commercial success would prevent us from generating sufficient revenue to fully fund our commercial and development activities.\nThe Orphan Drug designation for Korlym may not prevent competition from companies that develop other compounds for the treatment of Cushing syndrome. These companies may have significantly more resources than we do. Competition from them could limit our revenue from the commercialization of Korlym for the treatment of Cushing syndrome or other indications.\nAlthough we have received Orphan Drug designation in the United States, we cannot be assured that we will realize the potential benefits of the designation. Even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if it concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Upon expiration of the orphan drug exclusivity period, we may be subject to competition from manufacturers offering a generic form of Korlym at a lower price, in which case our business could be harmed.\nIn 2012 Novartis received approval in both the United States and the European Union (EU) to market its somatostatin analogue Signifor for adult patients with Cushing disease (a subset of Cushing syndrome that accounts for approximately 70 percent of all patients with Cushing syndrome) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative. In addition, Novartis has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States for the use of the experimental compound osilodrostat to treat Cushing disease and in the EU to treat Cushing syndrome. Novartis has begun a Phase 2 clinical trial in Japan investigating the use of this compound to treat Cushing syndrome due to causes other than Cushing disease and a Phase 3 clinical trial in the EU investigating its use to treat Cushing disease. Novartis has substantially more resources and experience than we do and may provide significant competition.\nLaboratoire HRA Pharma (HRA) received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of Cushing syndrome. HRA began and terminated a Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication. Strongbridge Biopharma plc (Strongbridge) has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of levoketoconazole to treat Cushing syndrome. Strongbridge has begun a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication. Exelgyn Laboratories, which operates as a subsidiary of Medi Challenge (Pty) Ltd., received Orphan Drug designation for mifepristone to treat Cushing syndrome in the EU, but has stated that it has not yet conducted any clinical trials.\nIf we cannot continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for Korlym, we will be unable to generate significant revenues.\nThe commercial success of Korlym depends on whether insurance coverage and reimbursement is available. Government payors, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, as well as commercial health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors, are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting reimbursement of new medicines. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for Korlym. Our dependence on the commercial success of Korlym makes us particularly susceptible to cost containment efforts. Unless government and other third-party payors continue to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement, physicians may not prescribe it and patients may not purchase it. In addition, meaningful delays in coverage for individual patients may increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\nIn some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. Also, the trends toward managed health care in the United States and recent laws and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for Korlym or the exclusion from reimbursement programs.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was passed in 2010, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, expanded Medicaid program eligibility and access to commercial health insurance coverage, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and promoted a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. The PPACA also appropriated additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research, although it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress. In addition, Congress could consider subsequent legislation to replace repealed elements of the PPACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. At this time, the full effect that the PPACA, the Executive Order and any subsequent legislation would have on our business remains unclear. Any new limitations on, changes to, or uncertainty with respect to the ability of individuals to enroll in governmental reimbursement programs or other third-party payor insurance plans could impact demand for Korlym, which in turn could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nOther legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that revised certain requirements involved in our calculation of prices we report in connection with our participation in government reimbursement programs so that Korlym will be eligible for purchase by, or qualify for partial or full reimbursement from, Medicaid and other government programs. The extent to which this rule may alter our reported prices and estimated rebates and chargebacks under government programs remains unclear.\nThese new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nPublic perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to sell Korlym.\nThe active ingredient in Korlym, mifepristone, is approved by the FDA in another drug for the termination of early pregnancy. As a result, mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the United States and elsewhere. Public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of Korlym by patients and physicians. Even though we have taken measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of Korlym to a pregnant woman, physicians may choose not to prescribe Korlym to a woman simply to avoid any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy.\nWe have no manufacturing or pharmacy capabilities and currently depend on third-party vendors to manufacture Korlym and dispense it to patients. We also depend on other suppliers to manufacture the API and capsules for CORT125134 and the other selective cortisol modulators we are developing. If these third parties are unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or dispense Korlym for us and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources, or if these third-parties fail to comply with FDA or other applicable regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements, our business will be harmed.\nPCAS, a third-party manufacturer, supplies all of the API in Korlym. Alcami, another third-party manufacturer, produces all of our Korlym tablets. Dohmen Life Science Services, a specialty pharmacy, dispenses Korlym. We have entered into agreements with these vendors that automatically renew. We rely on other third-parties to manufacture the API and capsules of the selective cortisol modulators that we are developing, including CORT125134. If any of these vendors is unable or unwilling to meet our future requirements, we may not be able to manufacture our product in a timely manner. Our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by them, subject to notice provisions.\nOur specialty pharmacy is subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities. We do not control the pharmacy\u2019s processes or operations and cannot assure that they will meet all regulatory requirements. In the event it fails to do so, we may be required to identify an alternative pharmacy, which we may not be able to do in a timely manner, which would harm our business.\nThe facilities used by our vendors to manufacture our product and product candidates must be approved by the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products. In addition, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. If our suppliers fail to manufacture Korlym or our product candidates on a timely basis in the quantities that we require, or fail to maintain manufacturing capabilities that meet FDA standards, we may exhaust our Korlym inventory and not be able to generate revenue, or our clinical development programs may be delayed.\nIf we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Korlym, we may be required to perform lengthy clinical trials, change the labeling of Korlym or withdraw it from the market.\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of Korlym requires us to study drug utilization to better characterize the reporting rates of adverse events associated with the long-term use of Korlym. If we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Korlym:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to conduct clinical trials, make changes in labeling, implement changes to or obtain re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nwe may experience a significant drop in the sales of Korlym;\n\u2022\nour reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u2022\nwe may become the target of lawsuits, including class action lawsuits.\nAny of these events could harm or prevent sales of Korlym or could increase our marketing costs.\nWe may not have adequate insurance to cover our exposure to product liability claims.\nWe may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that Korlym or one of our product candidates has caused adverse effects. A product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about Korlym or any of our product candidates\u2019 safety and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization. In some cases, less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the FDA approves the product for marketing. The active ingredient in Korlym is used to terminate pregnancy. Therefore, clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential must take strict precautions to ensure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women. The failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product liability claims.\nWe have product liability insurance with coverage limits we believe to be appropriate for a company marketing a single pharmaceutical product and developing others. However, this insurance may become prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Korlym or our product candidates, or result in meaningful underinsured or uninsured liability. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management\u2019s attention from conducting our business. If we were sued successfully, our liability could exceed our assets.\nWe are subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review. If we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome, or if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to generate revenue or may be subject to penalties and our business will be harmed.\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of Korlym was subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and requirements for post-marketing information reporting. If we violate any of the FDA\u2019s restrictions or other marketing requirements, the FDA could withdraw its approval.\nWe are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries with respect to the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, selling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and marketing of products. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, annual updates on manufacturing activities and continued compliance with cGMPs, and current good clinical practices (cGCPs), for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. cGMPs and cGCPs are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities through periodic inspections of manufacturing sites, trial sponsors, clinical investigators and clinical sites. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with FDA regulations and other applicable foreign and U.S. regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, untitled letters, warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, holds on clinical trials, product seizure or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, restrictions on product marketing, withdrawal of the product from the market, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, and suspension or revocation of product approvals.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Indeed, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. For example, on January 23, 2017, President Trump ordered a hiring freeze for all executive departments and agencies, including the FDA, which prohibits the FDA from filling employee vacancies or creating new positions. Under the terms of the order, the freeze will remain in effect until implementation of a plan to be recommended by the Director for the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, in\nconsultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in FDA\u2019s responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all.\nMoreover, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing all executive agencies, including the FDA, that, for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose restrictions on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. Similarly, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may place at risk the FDA marketing approval for Korlym and any other marketing approval that we may obtain, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to sustain profitability.\nWe may be subject to civil or criminal penalties if we market Korlym in a manner that violates FDA regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws.\nIn the United States, we are subject to FDA regulations governing the promotion of health care products. Although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe drugs for indications other than those approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such \u201coff-label\u201d uses. In the United States, we market Korlym for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of Korlym for this indication. Although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion of Korlym, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities by our employees or agents constitute \u201coff-label\u201d promotion of Korlym, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nIn addition, there are health care fraud and abuse regulations and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to or entering into \u201csham\u201d consulting arrangements with customers to induce such customers to purchase, order or recommend the company\u2019s products in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws and regulations; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by certain governmental programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in the promotion of \u201coff-label\u201d uses that caused customers to submit claims to and obtain reimbursement from governmental payors for non-covered \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers, and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports detailing these financial arrangements by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships\nwith physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products, and the manner in which we promote our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors, and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While we have policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nA break-down or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe store sensitive data on our computer networks and on the networks of third-party vendors, including our intellectual property and confidential information relating to our business and our employees. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our vendors are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, and other security breaches or accidents could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that a disruption or security breach resulted in the theft or loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed or otherwise harmed.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our own or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events, including earthquake, fire, flood, power loss and communications failures. For example, our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is earthquake-prone, and our specialty pharmacy and warehouses are located in areas that are subject to severe weather conditions. In addition, political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks, protests or other disruptive events. If any disaster or other similar event were to occur, we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce Korlym or our product candidates. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover, and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for, our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nRisks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates\nClinical drug development is lengthy and expensive and has an uncertain outcome. Results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results eventually obtained in later clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to the lack of efficacy or adverse safety profile of their medication candidate, despite promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ongoing clinical trials are too small to support marketing approvals for the compounds being studied. Even if these trials generate positive results, those results would have to be confirmed in one or more substantially larger, more expensive and lengthier trials before we could seek regulatory approvals.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndelays obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with Clinical Research Organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site;\n\u2022\nslower than anticipated patient enrollment;\n\u2022\nlack of funding;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022\npatient noncompliance with the protocol;\n\u2022\nadverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nnegative or problematic FDA or other regulatory authority inspections of our clinical operations or manufacturing operations; and\n\u2022\nreal or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the clinical trial sites where such trials are being conducted, the data safety monitoring board for such trial, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a trial for many reasons, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nOver the course of clinical development of any product candidate, we may decide, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us, to pursue clinical or preclinical studies in addition to those we had initially planned. These may require additional funding, the availability of which is not assured. Also, additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable may delay or prevent the completion of our development programs or increase their cost. Even if we are able to conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate, we may never receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe depend on third-parties to conduct and manage many of our clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. Failure of these third-parties to successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected timelines may prevent or delay regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates, which could substantially harm our business.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third-parties such as CROs to manage many of our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. We control only certain aspects of these third-parties\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the prescribed protocol and the applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third-parties are required to comply with cGCPs. If we or any of the third-parties working on or conducting our trials fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approval of our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cGCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with drug product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may\nrequire us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the effectiveness of those sites. If our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients or fail to enroll them on schedule, we may be unable to complete our trials as planned, which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of our product candidates.\nWe have agreements with the CROs and consultants helping to conduct our clinical trials and to perform investigator supervision, data collection and analysis for these trials. We may not be able to maintain relationships with these or other CROs and consultants, or with the clinical investigators and clinical sites conducting our trials. If any of our agreements with these third-parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the third-parties on which we rely do not carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market or promote any products before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Although we have received FDA approval to market Korlym, we may be unable to maintain such approval. We may not receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Obtaining regulatory approval of a new drug is an uncertain, lengthy and expensive process. Success is never guaranteed. Failure can occur at any stage. In order to receive approval from the FDA for a product candidate, we must demonstrate that the new drug product is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes for the product candidate comply with FDA regulations known as \u201ccGMPs.\u201d cGMPs include requirements related to production processes, quality control and assurance, and recordkeeping. Our inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of product sales, and criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our business and our financial condition.\nFuture governmental action or changes in FDA policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an NDA in the United States. As of January 23, 2017, FDA is prohibited from filling employee vacancies or creating new positions pursuant to an Executive Order issued by President Trump. Under the terms of the order, the freeze will remain in effect until implementation of a plan to be recommended by the Director for the OMB, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in FDA\u2019s responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, including NDAs, and may also hinder FDA\u2019s ability to issue and implement regulations or guidance in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, because the only other currently FDA-approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy, we expect that the label for mifepristone for any indication will include, as Korlym\u2019s does, some limitations, including a so-called \u201cblack-box\u201d warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements; and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing restrictions and obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates abroad.\nWe may seek to commercialize our products and product candidates in international markets with the help of one or more partners or on our own. Outside the United States, we may commercialize a product only if we receive a\nmarketing authorization and, in many cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities, whose approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process, and, in some cases, additional risks. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any foreign market. Although we have received Orphan Drug designation in the EU of Korlym to treat patients with Cushing syndrome, we are not currently seeking to obtain any foreign approvals.\nWe face competition from companies with substantial financial, technical and marketing resources.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms, universities and public and private research institutions. Moreover, we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made. These competitors, may develop and commercialize medications that are superior to and more cost-effective than ours.\nMany of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience, more financial and marketing resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in drug development, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercializing products. They may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to our product candidates, which could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\nOur efforts to discover, develop and commercialize product candidates beyond Korlym for the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome are at an early stage and we may fail to successfully commercialize any of them.\nTo develop additional sources of revenue, we must identify and develop new product candidates or new therapeutic uses for Korlym. Cortisol modulators may not be effective to treat any additional indications. Moreover, we could discover that the use of cortisol modulators has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe. Due to the potential for lack of efficacy and side effects inherent in novel compounds and in new uses for existing medications, we are entering multiple compounds into development, which will increase our rate of spending with no assurance that we will be successful in developing drugs that are safe and effective.\nWe may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates. If we do enter into such an arrangement, we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement. Any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement.\nWe only have significant clinical experience with mifepristone, the active ingredient in Korlym, and we may determine that mifepristone is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome. We may pursue other cortisol modulators for this use. The compounds developed pursuant to our early discovery, preclinical and clinical research programs may fail to become viable product candidates regardless of the resources we dedicate to their development. Even if product candidates are identified, we may abandon further development efforts after expending significant expense and time due to financial constraints, concerns over safety or efficacy, marketing considerations, manufacturing difficulties or other reasons. Moreover, governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts. If we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for cortisol modulators, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe expect that the further development of our research and development efforts will be constrained by our existing administrative, operational and management resources. Growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. To date, we have relied on a small management team. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage growth effectively.\nTo that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022\nmanage our sales and marketing efforts, clinical trials, research and development activities and supply chain effectively;\n\u2022\nhire additional management, clinical development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022\ndevelop our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key managerial, scientific, sales, marketing, and financial personnel, and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas. We depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel. Any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors. The loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research, development and commercialization efforts without their expertise.\nWe face intense competition for qualified personnel from numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive San Francisco Bay Area. Although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date, we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain these personnel could harm our commercial business or delay the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nRapid technological change could make our product and product candidates obsolete.\nPharmaceutical technologies undergo rapid and significant change. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Korlym and any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any of the cost of their development. Rapid technological change could make Korlym and our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Needs and Financial Results\nWe may need additional capital in order to complete the development of Korlym for additional indications or for the development and commercialization of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators. Additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may need to raise funds to continue the development of our proprietary selective cortisol modulators for any indication or for additional indications for Korlym. We may also raise funds for other research and development activities, including clinical trials, for working capital or for other general corporate purposes, or to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our own.\nFactors affecting our liquidity include the following:\n\u2022\nthe pace at which physicians adopt Korlym as a treatment;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of insurance companies and the government payors to provide coverage for Korlym;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of clinical trials of Korlym and our other product candidates and the further clinical development of those compounds;\n\u2022\nchanges in our research and development plans for Korlym and our other product candidates; and\n\u2022\ndisputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including announcements of claims of infringement, interference or litigation against us or our licensors.\nWe may also choose to raise additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our sales of common stock and warrants and the exercises of warrants have been dilutive to stockholders and any additional equity financing could cause further dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. If we obtain funds through collaborations with others, these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to Korlym or our product candidates. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations.\nWe have incurred substantial losses and we may incur losses in the future.\nWe have financed our operations and internal growth in recent years primarily through revenue from the sale of Korlym, the sale of our common stock and our financing agreement with Biopharma. Prior to that we relied on the public sale of common stock and private placements of preferred and common stock. We may incur additional losses as we continue our discovery and clinical development programs, apply for regulatory approvals, acquire and/or develop treatments in other therapeutic areas, and expand our sales and marketing capabilities.\nWe may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue or secure adequate funding for these programs.\nThe costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allows us to consider for further development are collectively greater than the funds currently available to us. For example, we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are selective cortisol modulators but do not appear to block the progesterone receptor. Further development of these proprietary compounds or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that our expected revenue will be insufficient to support such programs and we are unable to obtain funding from other sources.\nGlobal economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nRenewed or increased turbulence in the global markets and economies may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce, or cease, to provide credit to businesses such as ours, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow funds or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing clinical or drug development activity or limiting our commercial efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we acquire other selective cortisol modulators or other technologies or potential products, we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nIf appropriate opportunities arise, we may attempt to acquire products or product candidates that are complementary to our operating plan. We currently have no commitments, agreements or plans for any acquisitions. Acquiring rights to another potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology. Future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt, expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFailure to meet our obligations under our Financing Agreement with Biopharma could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nPursuant to our Financing Agreement with Biopharma entered into in August 2012, we are obligated to make payments to Biopharma equal to 20 percent of our net product sales of Korlym, any future mifepristone-based products and our next-generation selective cortisol modulators, subject to certain quarterly caps, as well as an un-capped 20 percent of any upfront, milestone or other contingent payments we receive with respect to Covered Products, until such payments to Biopharma total $45.0 million, at which point the obligation will be extinguished.\nPursuant to this agreement, we may not: (i) incur indebtedness greater than the sum of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including such items as non-cash stock-based compensation, for the four calendar quarters preceding such incurrence, which we refer to as the Indebtedness Covenant; (ii) pay a dividend or other cash distribution, unless we have cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million after such payment; (iii) amend or restate our certificate of incorporation or bylaws unless such amendments or restatements do not affect Biopharma\u2019s interests under the transaction; and (iv) encumber any of the collateral securing our performance under the agreement.\nThe percentage used to calculate our payments to Biopharma would increase to 50 percent and any applicable payment caps would lapse if we (i) fail to provide Biopharma with certain information regarding our promotion and sales of Covered Products, (ii) do not devote a commercially reasonable amount of resources to the promotion and marketing of the Covered Products or (iii) violate the Indebtedness Covenant and, in each case, fail to cure within the applicable cure period.\nUpon a Corcept change of control transaction, as defined in the agreement, Biopharma will be automatically entitled to receive any amounts not previously paid, up to our maximum repayment obligation of $45.0 million. As defined in the agreement, \u201cChange of Control\u201d includes, among other things, (i) a greater than 50 percent change in the ownership of Corcept, (ii) certain changes in Board composition of Corcept and (iii) the licensing of Korlym to a third-party for sale in the United States.\nTo secure our obligations under the agreement, we granted Biopharma a security interest in our rights in patents, trademarks, trade names, domain names, copyrights, know-how and regulatory approvals related to the Covered Products, all books and records relating to the foregoing and all proceeds of the foregoing, which we refer to as the Collateral. If we (i) fail to deliver a royalty payment when due and do not remedy that failure within 30 days, (ii) fail to maintain a first-priority perfected security interest in the Collateral in the United States and do not remedy that failure within five business days of receiving notice of such failure or (iii) become subject to an event of bankruptcy, then Biopharma may attempt to recover up to $45.0 million (after deducting any payments we have already made).\nWe cannot assure that we will not breach the covenants or other terms of, or that an event of default will not occur under this agreement and, if a breach or event of default occurs, we cannot assure that we will be able to cure the event within the time permitted. Any failure to pay our obligations when due, any breach or default of our covenants or other obligations, or any other event that causes an acceleration of payment at a time when we do not have sufficient resources to meet these obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future viability.\nThe acceleration of the payment obligation in the event of a change of control transaction may make us less attractive to potential acquirers, and the payment of such funds out of our available cash or acquisition proceeds would reduce acquisition proceeds for our stockholders.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIf Korlym or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes, we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. Our product candidates may give rise to claims that our patents are invalid or that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others. If it is determined that our product candidates infringe on others\u2019 patent rights, we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights. If we fail to obtain licenses when necessary, we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents, or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all. If we do become involved in intellectual property litigation, we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation. We believe that we do not currently infringe any third-party\u2019s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property except to Stanford University and the University of Chicago.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of Korlym for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer and other potential uses of cortisol modulators. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage.\nWe own 20 issued U.S. method of use patents and have exclusively licensed six issued U.S. method of use patents. We have six U.S. method of use patent applications pending for our next-generation selective cortisol modulators. We also own eight U.S. composition of matter patents, with one additional U.S. application pending. In addition, we have been issued foreign method of use patents and composition of matter patents around the world. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate. We have filed, and will continue to file, where we deem appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications.\nWe have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents from Stanford University for the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia, including early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We have also exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago two issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer and a third issued U.S. patent covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nWe bear the costs of prosecuting, protecting and defending these patents. In order to maintain the exclusive license to these patents until their expiration, we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to both universities. If we do not comply with our obligations under our agreement with Stanford, we may lose the right to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia. If the University of Chicago were to terminate our licenses, we may not be able to commercialize any cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer.\nOur patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third-parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents. Our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents, and any patent issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Our patent claims may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third-parties from producing competing products. The laws of foreign countries in which we may someday compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology, our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology in these countries, which would impair our ability to succeed.\nIf a third-party successfully asserted an infringement claim against us, we could be forced to pay damages and be prevented from developing, manufacturing or marketing our potential products. We do not have liability insurance for patent infringement. A third-party could require us to obtain a license to use their intellectual property, which we may not be able to do on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our resources and of management\u2019s time. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim, defending a lawsuit is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention from productive business.\nOur ability to compete in the market could be diminished if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Nevertheless, these measures may not provide adequate protection, in which case third-parties could use our proprietary information to diminish our ability to compete in the market. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also realize that our trade secrets may become known despite our best efforts.\nThe mifepristone patents that we own cover the use of mifepristone, not its composition, which may make it more difficult for us to prove patent infringement if physicians prescribe another manufacturer\u2019s mifepristone or if patients acquire mifepristone from other sources, such as the internet or underground market.\nWe own or have exclusively licensed issued U.S. patents covering the methods of using cortisol modulators to treat a variety of disorders, including triple-negative breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer. A method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound, not its composition. Because our patents do not cover the composition of mifepristone, we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone to treat disorders not covered by our method of use patents. The availability of mifepristone for these disorders may enable patients to obtain mifepristone for indications covered by our patents. Although any such \u201coff-label\u201d use would violate our patents, effectively monitoring compliance and enforcing our rights may be difficult and costly. In addition, we cannot be assured that patients will not obtain mifepristone from other sources. As with other pharmaceutical products, patients may be able to purchase mifepristone through the internet or underground market. Mifepristone is also sold in the United States by Danco Laboratories for the termination of early pregnancy. While distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician\u2019s office and covered by other restrictions, we cannot be certain that Cushing syndrome patients will not be able to obtain mifepristone from this source or others, should another company receive approval to market mifepristone for another indication.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited.\nWe cannot assure that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time. Holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active. During the 52-week period ended February 28, 2017, our average daily trading volume was approximately 453,215 shares and the intra-day sales prices per share of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market ranged from $3.80 to $10.00. As of February 28, 2017, our officers, directors and principal stockholders controlled 22 percent of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure of our financial performance to meet the guidance we have provided to the public;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndistributions in-kind of our common stock by our venture capital or private equity stockholders, which will increase the supply of our common stock and could decrease its price;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of our common stock by us, our officers, directors or our stockholders;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products;\n\u2022\nnew products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour cash and short-term investment position;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors\u2019 potential development programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us, our collaborators or our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nlimited number of shares of our common stock held by our non-affiliates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning collaborations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed; and\n\u2022\nadditional financing activities.\nAll stock markets, including the NASDAQ Capital Market on which our stock is listed, and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. This volatility may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur stock price may decline if our financial performance does not meet the guidance that we provided to the public, estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations.\nWe have provided guidance as to our expected 2017 revenue. Our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of the release of such guidance. Our actual results may vary materially from our guidance.\nReasons why we might fail to meet our financial guidance or other investor expectations include, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. There are inherent difficulties in predicting the amount of Korlym that will be sold. For example, the rate of physician adoption of Korlym is uncertain. Research analysts have published a range of revenue estimates, based on their own analyses. We believe research analysts will consider the guidance we have provided as one factor in determining their own estimates. Readers of this annual report should rely on our guidance and the estimates of research analysts at their own discretion.\nResearch analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could decline rapidly and significantly. Securities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage. Additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock\u2019s market price.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. As additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market, whether as a result of distributions in-kind of our common stock by our venture capital or private equity stockholders, the exercise of stock options by employees, or equity financing by us, the supply of our common stock will increase, which could decrease the share price. Substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale, subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions.\nOur officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting as a group, could significantly influence corporate actions.\nAs of February 28, 2017, our officers and directors control 22 percent of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.\nChanges in laws and regulations may significantly increase our costs, which could harm our financial results.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, affecting our company, including statutes and regulations concerning the development, approval, and marketing of medications, the provisions of the PPACA requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ Capital Market have and will likely continue to result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. We are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, and this investment may result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. At present, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs.\nIn addition, new rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, or our board committees, or as executive officers.\nWe may fail to comply with public company obligations, including the securities laws and regulations. Such compliance is costly and requires significant management resources.\nWe are a small company with limited resources. The federal securities laws and regulations, including the corporate governance and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate the effectiveness of, and provide a management report with respect to, our internal controls over financial reporting. It also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to complete management\u2019s required assessment and report as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting.\nChanges in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our accounting policies or operating practices.\nAccounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies are subject to continual review, interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements, changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law and payment acceleration provisions under the Biopharma Financing Agreement may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult, even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. Some of these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders, require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent. In addition, a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or the Board of Directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. These provisions may prevent or delay a change in our Board of Directors or our management, which our Board of Directors appoints. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. In addition, our payment obligations to Biopharma accelerate in the event of a change of control transaction. See \u201cRisk Factors - Failure to meet our obligations under our Financing Agreement with Biopharma could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\u201d These provisions in our charter and bylaws and under Delaware law and the Financing Agreement could reduce the price that investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 90125, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CORT"}
