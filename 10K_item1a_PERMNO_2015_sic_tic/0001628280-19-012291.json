{"cik": "914712", "company": "Steel Connect, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.- RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to purchase our common stock. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect us. It should be recognized that other risks may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent than indicated. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you many lose all or part of your investment.\nForward-looking statements in this document and those we make from time to time through our senior management are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements concerning the expected future revenue or earnings or concerning projected plans, performance, or development of products and services, as well as other estimates related to future operations are necessarily only estimates of future results. We cannot assure you that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements represent our current expectations and are inherently uncertain. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue and profits from a small number of clients, and adverse industry trends or the loss of one or more of any of those clients could significantly damage our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue by providing supply chain management services and marketing solutions to a small number of clients. Our business and future growth will continue to depend in large part on the industry trend towards outsourcing supply chain management and other business processes, as well as direct mail remaining a critical piece of customer's marketing spend. If these trends do not continue or decline, demand for our supply chain management services and marketing solutions will decline, and our financial results could suffer.\nIn addition, the loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could cause our revenue and or profits to decline and our financial results could suffer.\nOur business is expected to continue to derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and or profits from sales to a small number of key clients. In general, we do not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum\namount of services from us, or to designate us as its sole supplier of any particular services. If any of our key clients fail to respond successfully to market shifts, we would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our revenue and or profits from key clients will not decline in future periods.\nWe may have difficulty achieving and sustaining operating profitability, and if we deplete our working capital balances, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, we reported operating losses of $(25.3) million and $(8.3) million, respectively. Although we have increased our revenues, and reduced our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, we anticipate that we may continue to incur significant fixed operating expenses in the future, including both cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Therefore, since our revenue is subject to fluctuations, there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain operating income in the future. We may also use significant amounts of cash in an effort to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business. At July 31, 2019, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of approximately $32.5 million and current liabilities of approximately $256.9 million. If we are unable to achieve or sustain operating profitability, we risk depleting our working capital balances and our business will be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our contracts do not contain minimum purchase requirements and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by clients, which could decrease revenue and materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to demand variability by our clients, which is difficult to predict, has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate, sometimes materially from year to year and even from quarter to quarter. The level and timing of orders placed by these clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users for the Supply Chain business, as well as, individual client strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions impacting both of our operating segments. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of their products or insufficient capacity in our sites, or in the alternative, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe Supply Chain business conducts business outside of the U.S., which may expose the Company to additional risks not typically associated with companies that operate solely in the U.S.\nModusLink conducts business and has operations outside the U.S. These operations have additional risks, including risks relating to currency exchange, less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, differences in the legal and regulatory environment, different publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets, economic and political risks, and possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes. There can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our operations in certain countries.\nModusLink also faces several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, U.S. laws such as export control laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our business is conducted in China, where we face additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in China by foreign companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and limitations on the repatriation of cash;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuation and exchange rate risks;\n\u2022\nprotection of intellectual property, both for us and our clients;\n\u2022\nevolving regulatory systems and standards, including recent tax law and labor law changes;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining management personnel and skilled employees; and\n\u2022\nexpiration of tax holidays.\nRecent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our operations.\nThe federal government has recently imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our operations. Foreign governments, including China, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trade conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our operating costs, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial statements.\nA decline in our key business sectors or a reduction in consumer demand generally could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our Supply Chain business revenue comes from clients in the technology and consumer products sectors, which is intensely competitive, very volatile and subject to rapid changes. A large portion of our Direct Marketing business revenue is generated from clients in the insurance, MSO, financial services and subscription services products sectors, which may be subject to fluctuations in overall economic conditions. Declines in the overall performance of the technology and consumer products sectors have in the past and could in the future, adversely affect the demand for supply chain management services and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. In addition, industry changes, such as the transition of more collateral materials from physical form to digital form, the convergence of functionality of smart phones and change in marketing channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services or devices we currently handle. To the extent recent uncertainty in the economy or other factors result in decreased demand for our clients' products, we may experience a reduction in volumes of client products that we handle or reduction in demand for our marketing solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur business operating results have fluctuated widely on a quarterly basis during the last several years. We expect that we may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results. Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, have contributed to these quarterly fluctuations in the past and may continue to contribute to fluctuations. Therefore, operating results for future periods are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. These factors include:\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n\u2022\nimplementation of our strategic initiatives and achievement of expected results of these initiatives;\n\u2022\ndemand for our services;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence and demand;\n\u2022\nspecific economic conditions in the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product introductions or software releases by our clients or their competitors;\n\u2022\npayment of costs associated with our acquisitions, sales of assets and investments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new products and services;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\ntemporary shortages in supply from vendors;\n\u2022\ncharges for impairment of long-lived assets, including restructuring in future periods;\n\u2022\npolitical instability including changes in tariff laws or natural disasters in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor laws;\n\u2022\navailability of labor resources and the variability of available rates for labor resources;\n\u2022\nunionization of our labor and contract labor; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of automation.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful or indicative of our future performance. In some fiscal quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe must maintain adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs, which present risks to our financial position and operating results.\nWe must purchase and maintain adequate levels of inventory (including adequate levels of paper inventory used by IWCO) in order to meet client needs rapidly and on a timely basis. The markets, including the technology sector served by many of our clients, are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced product specification requirements, and evolving industry standards. These changes may cause inventory on hand to decline substantially in value or to rapidly become obsolete. The majority of our clients in the Supply Chain business offer protection from the loss in value of inventory. However, our clients may become unable or unwilling to fulfill their protection obligations and the inability of our clients to fulfill their protection obligations could lower our gross margins and cause us to record inventory write-downs. In our Direct Marketing business, our clients typically do not provide such price protection. If we are unable to manage the inventory on hand with our clients with a high degree of precision, we may have insufficient product supplies or we may have excess inventory, resulting in inventory write-downs, which may harm our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or components in the quantities required to fulfill client orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our suppliers. We may occasionally experience a supply shortage of some products as a result of strong demand or problems experienced by our suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of those products may increase, or the products may not be available at all. Accordingly, an inability to secure and maintain an adequate supply of products, packaging materials or components to fulfill our client orders on a timely basis, or a failure to meet clients' expectations could result in lost revenue, lower client satisfaction, negative perceptions in the marketplace, potential claims for damages and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may encounter problems in our efforts to increase operational efficiencies.\nWe continue to seek to identify ways to increase efficiencies and productivity and effect cost savings. In addition to already undertaken projects in our Supply Chain business designed to increase our operational efficiencies, including the standardization to a global solutions platform through an integrated ERP system and the implementation of a model utilizing centralized \"hub\" locations to service multiple \"spoke\" locations across the Americas, Asia and Europe regions, our executive team is continuing its review across the organization designed to improve our operations, including a commitment to automate certain facilities. IWCO is continually employing programs to achieve efficiencies which include investment in capital equipment and automation. We cannot assure you that these projects and investment in capital will result in the realization of the expected benefits that we anticipate in a timely manner or at all. We may encounter problems with these projects that will divert the attention of management and/or result in additional costs and unforeseen project delays. If we, or these projects do not achieve expected results, our business, financial position and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIWCO may have trouble obtaining and retaining its labor force.\nIWCO's production operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled and unskilled employees to take advantage of all available manufacturing capacity and ensure on-time delivery of clients' marketing programs to meet service level agreements (SLAs) without penalty. IWCO's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and promote personnel for all areas of its organization. Labor market conditions may have an adverse impact\non profitability and ability to deliver product on time. IWCO is exploring automation and efficiency options to reduce its reliance on direct labor.\nChange in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development, impact of costs associated with business combinations and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in share-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes;\n\u2022\nincreases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nthe expiration of tax holidays.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.\nThe gross margins in the Supply Chain business are low, which magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our financial results.\nAs a result of intense price competition in the technology products and consumer products marketplaces, the gross margins in our Supply Chain business are low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the future. These low gross margins magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our financial results. Increased competition arising from industry consolidation and/or low demand for products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins. Portions of our operating expenses are relatively fixed, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Our current ability to forecast the amount and timing of future order volumes is difficult, and we expect this to continue because we are highly dependent upon the business needs of our clients, which are highly variable. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins. We may also be required to spend money to restructure our operations should future demand fall significantly in one or more facilities. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in response to competitive price pressures, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive and often lack significant barriers to entry enabling new businesses to enter these markets relatively easily. Numerous well-established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our offerings. The market for supply chain management products and services, as well as marketing solutions, is very competitive, and the intensity of the competition is expected to continue to increase. Any failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to maintain and increase market share, which could result in serious harm to our business. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors will continue to have greater financial, technical, operational and marketing resources. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors. Competitive pressures may also force prices for our products and services down and these price reductions may reduce our revenue. The competition we face may also increase as a result of consolidation within the supply chain management and logistics, and marketing solutions industries. For example, if as a result of consolidation, our competitors are able to obtain more favorable terms from their suppliers, offer more\ncomprehensive services to their customers, or otherwise take actions that increase their competitive strengths, our competitive position and therefore our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nThe physical or intellectual property of our clients may be damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost while in our possession, subjecting us to litigation and other adverse consequences.\nIn the course of providing supply chain management services to our clients, we often have possession of or access to their physical and intellectual property, including consigned inventory, databases, software masters, certificates of authenticity and similar valuable physical or intellectual property. If this physical or intellectual property is damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost, we could suffer:\n\u2022\nclaims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity; and\n\u2022\nlitigation that could be costly and time consuming.\nWe may be liable if third parties misappropriate personal information of our clients or our clients' customers; and laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against us.\nAlthough we have put in place policies and procedures to address the new European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") that will be effective as of January 2020, there are continuing risks related to the management of personal information as part of our product offering. In addition, ongoing efforts to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA and similar laws may entail substantial expenses that may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement.\nAny security breach or inadvertent release of personal information could expose us to risks of loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations. If third parties are able to penetrate our network or telecommunications security or otherwise misappropriate the personal information or credit card information of our clients' customers we retain in providing certain supply chain services, or if we give third parties improper access to such information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. They could also include claims for other misuses of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims could result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could be significant. Further, any resulting adverse publicity arising from investigations could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe funds held for clients may be subject to credit risk.\nIn the course of providing certain supply chain services to our clients, we at times have possession of client funds. The funds are maintained at financial institutions, and the balances associated with these funds are at times without or in excess of federally insured limits. If these funds are impaired, misappropriated or stolen, we could suffer:\n\u2022\nclaims under client agreements or applicable law, or other liability for damages;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue due to adverse client reaction;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity; and\n\u2022\nlitigation that could be costly and time consuming.\nMaterial disruption in our information systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Upgrading our information technology systems is costly and subject to delay, and there is no assurance new systems will provide the benefits expected. We may also experience operational problems attributable to the installation, implementation, integration, performance, features or functionality of third-party software, systems and services. In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the\nmisappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, each of which could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nState and federal laws may also require us to provide notice to affected individuals if their personal data is the subject of a breach in security, which would impose costs and could lead to additional liability and negative publicity. We take cybersecurity seriously and devote significant resources and tools to protect our systems, products and data and to prevent unwanted intrusions. However, these security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent, detect and adequately address or mitigate such cyber-attacks or security breaches. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems, regardless of whether we or our third-party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe can complement our current business activities, both financially and strategically. Acquisitions involve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business' past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures under Company control, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The realization of anticipated synergies or benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced. As a result, there is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses.\nOTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax benefits (collectively, \"NOLs\" or \"Tax Benefits\").\nOur past operations generated significant NOLs. Under federal tax laws, for NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid in our prior two tax years or on our future taxable income for up to 20 years, at which point they \"expire\" for such purposes. Until they expire, we can \"carry forward\" NOLs and certain related tax credits that we do not use in any particular year to offset taxable income in future years. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, we generally can use any such NOLs and certain related tax credits to reduce ordinary income tax paid on our future taxable income indefinitely, however, any such NOLs cannot be used to reduce ordinary income tax paid in prior tax years. In addition, the deduction for NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80 percent of our taxable income for any tax year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction). NOLs arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, are referred to herein as \"Current NOLs.\" We cannot estimate the exact amount of NOLs that we will be able use to reduce future income tax liability because we cannot predict the amount and timing of our future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\" or \"Internal Revenue Code\"). Under Section 382, an \"ownership change\" occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders that each owns (or is deemed to own) at least 5% of our common stock increases their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. If an ownership change is deemed to occur, the limitations imposed by Section 382 could significantly limit our ability to use our NOLs to reduce future income tax liability and result in a material amount of our Current NOLs expiring unused and, therefore, significantly impair the value of our NOLs.\nOur ability to use our Current NOLs in future years will depend upon the amount of our federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state taxable income in future years to use the Current NOLs before they expire, we will lose the benefit of the Current NOLs permanently. In addition to the generation of future federal and state taxable income, our ability to use our Current NOLs will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and once identified, successfully consummating an acquisition of or investment in these candidates.\nOn January 19, 2018, Company's Board of Directors adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (\"Tax Plan\") designed to preserve the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs. The Tax Plan is intended to prevent an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would impair the Company's ability to utilize its NOLs. On April 12,\n2018, at the Annual Meeting of Steel Connect's stockholders (the \"2017 Annual Meeting\") the stockholders of Steel Connect approved the Tax Plan and the continuation of its terms.\nAs part of the plan Tax Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one right (a \"Right\") for each share of common stock then outstanding. The dividend was payable to holders of record as of the close of business on January 29, 2018. Any shares of common stock issued after January 29, 2018, will be issued together with the Rights. Each Right initially represents the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of newly created Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock.\nInitially, the Rights were attached to all certificates representing shares of common stock then outstanding and no separate rights certificates were distributed. In the case of book entry shares, the Rights are evidenced by notations in the book entry accounts. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Tax Plan, the Rights will separate from the common stock and a distribution date (the \"Distribution Date\") will occur upon the earlier of (i) ten (10) business days following a public announcement that a stockholder (or group) has become a beneficial owner of 4.99-percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding and (ii) ten (10) business days (or such later date as the Board determines) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group becoming a 4.99-percent stockholder.\nPursuant to the Tax Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99-percent stockholder after adoption of the Tax Plan, the Rights would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares of Steel Connect at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the new 4.99-percent stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which Steel Connect is acquired in a merger or other business combination after an non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a new 4.99-percent stockholder, each holder of the Right (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company's common stock at a discount.\nThe Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the earliest of (i) 11:59 p.m., on January 18, 2021; (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged as provided in the Tax Plan; and (iii) the time at which the Board determines that the Tax Plan is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of NOLs.\nOn April 12, 2018, following approval by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, Steel Connect filed an Amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Protective Amendment\") with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nThe amount of NOLs that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOLs or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOLs to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOLs to us could be substantially reduced.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and foreign tax audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have been reserved.\nWe are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to income taxes and for various other taxes, including but not limited to value added tax, or VAT, excise tax, sales and use tax, gross receipts tax and property tax. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties, if our positions are not accepted by the auditing tax authority.\nWe may be subject to state sales taxes that we have not paid, collected from our customers or reserved for on our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., holding that a state may require a remote seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax on goods and services provided to purchasers in the state, overturning certain existing court precedent. We are evaluating our state tax filings with respect to the recent Wayfair decision and prior regulations, and are in the process of reviewing our collection practices. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which we have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. One or more jurisdictions may change their laws or policies to apply their sales, use or other similar taxes to our operations, and if such changes were made it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have problems raising or accessing capital we need in the future.\nIn recent years, we have financed our operations and met our capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of our securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of Company owned facilities that were not being fully utilized. These funding sources may not be sufficient in the future, and we may need to obtain funding from outside sources. However, we may not be able to obtain funding from outside sources. In addition, even if we find outside funding sources, we may be required to issue to those outside sources securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of our common stock. We may also be required to take other actions, which may lessen the value of our common stock or dilute our common stockholders, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us or issuing additional shares of common stock. If we experience difficulties raising capital in the future, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, market and other conditions largely beyond our control may affect our ability to engage in future sales of our securities, the timing of any sales, and the amount of proceeds we receive from sales of our securities. Even if we are able to sell our securities in the future, we may not be able to sell at favorable prices or on favorable terms.\nIf financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nWe depend on important employees, and the loss of any of those employees may harm our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees, as well as management of our subsidiaries. The familiarity of these individuals with technology and service-related industries makes them especially critical to our success. Our success is also dependent on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate high quality personnel. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key employees may harm our business. Also, IWCO's sales executives are focused on specific industry verticals leveraging their expertise to drive clients marketing results. The majority of the sales force has at least 10 years' experience in the industry.

Specifically, Warren G. Lichtenstein, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board, is affiliated with Steel Holdings and is now the Executive Chairman of Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. (\"Steel Holdings GP\"). Glen Kassan, our Vice Chairman of the Board and former Chief Administrative Officer, is an employee of Steel Services. Jack L. Howard, the President and a director of Steel Holdings GP, was appointed to the Board upon the closing of the Preferred Stock Transaction described above. William T. Fejes, the Chief Operating Officer of Steel Holdings, was appointed to the Board upon the closing of the Preferred Stock Transaction described above. See Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance in Item 10 of this Form 10-K for full biographical information for Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kassan, Howard and Fejes.\nAs a result, these individuals may face potential conflicts of interest with each other and with our stockholders. They may be presented with situations in their capacity as our directors that conflict with their fiduciary obligations to Steel Holdings and its affiliates, which in turn may have interests that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOur Board is composed of seven directors, of that, three directors are independent and the remaining four are not independent.\nLitigation pending against us could materially impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently a party to various legal and other proceedings. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Form 10-K. These matters may involve substantial expense to us, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any litigation.\nRISKS RELATED TO A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS\nManagement's determination that a material weakness exists in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In Item 9A of this Annual Report, management reports that a material weakness exists in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Due to this material weakness, management has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. Any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls, among other things, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock, and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOverview of Credit Facilities\nOn December 15, 2017, MLGS Merger Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Steel Connect (\"MLGS\"), entered into a financing agreement (the \"Financing Agreement\") by and among MLGS, Instant Web, LLC, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of IWCO (as \"Borrower\"), IWCO, and certain of IWCO's subsidiaries (together with IWCO, the \"Guarantors\"), the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as collateral agent and administrative agent for the lenders. MLGS was the initial borrower under the Financing Agreement, but immediately upon the consummation of the IWCO Acquisition, Borrower became the borrower under the Financing Agreement. The Financing Agreement provides for a $393.0 million term loan facility and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility (together, the \"Cerberus Credit Facility\"). Proceeds of the Cerberus Credit Facility were used (i) to finance a portion of the IWCO Acquisition, (ii) to repay certain existing indebtedness of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes and (iv) to pay fees and expenses related to the Financing Agreement and the IWCO Acquisition. The Cerberus Credit Facility has a maturity of five years.\nOn June 30, 2014, two direct and wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company (the \"ModusLink Borrowers\") entered into a revolving credit and security agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), as borrowers and guarantors, with PNC Bank, National Association (\"PNC Bank\"), as lender and as agent, respectively. The Credit Agreement had a five (5) year term which was to expire on June 30, 2019. On April 30, 2019, the Borrowers and Guarantors entered into a Second Amendment to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") by and among the Borrowers, the Guarantors, the financial institutions named as parties thereto from time to time as lenders (collectively, the \"Lenders\") and PNC Bank as Agent. The Second Amendment amends the Credit Agreement in order to, among other things, (i) reduce the aggregate Revolving Commitment Amounts (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Lenders and the related Maximum Revolving Advance Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) available to Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, from $50.0 million to $25.0 million, and (ii) to extend the maturity of the term under the Credit Agreement by six (6) months from June 30, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The maximum credit commitment of $25.0 million is available for letters of credit (with a sublimit of $5.0 million).\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, some which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt, meet working capital requirements and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. See Liquidity and Capital Resources contained in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, our Financing Agreement and our Credit Agreement (together, the \"Debt Agreements\") require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe Debt Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will restrict our operational flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under the Debt Agreements.\nThe Debt Agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants, including with regard to specified financial ratios, that limit and restrict our operations and may hamper our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these and other covenants under the Debt Agreements. Our failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the Debt Agreements may result in an\nevent of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings, and shareholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of our creditors on our assets.\nIf we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and shareholders may lose all of their investment.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 80114, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "STCN"}
