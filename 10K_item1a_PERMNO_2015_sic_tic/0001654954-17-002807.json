{"cik": "884650", "company": "INFINITE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information provided in our reports, you should consider the following factors carefully in evaluating our business and us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nWe depend on prime contracts or subcontracts with the federal, state and local governments for a substantial portion of our sales, and our business would be seriously harmed if the government ceased doing business with us or our prime contractors or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us or our prime contractors.\nWe derived approximately 68% of our sales in 2016 and 84% in 2015 from federal, state and local government contracts as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We expect that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future from work performed under government contracts, as we have in the past, and from marketing efforts focused on commercial enterprises. If we or our prime contractors were suspended or prohibited from contracting with federal, state or local governments, or if our reputation or relationship with the federal, state or local governments and commercial enterprises were impaired, or if any of the foregoing otherwise ceased doing business with us or our prime contractors or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us or our prime contractors, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the federal, state and local governments.\nBecause we derive a significant portion of our sales from contracts with federal, state and local governments, we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in their contract programs. Changes in federal, state and local government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs which call for the types of services that we provide or a change in government contracting policies, could cause U.S. Governmental agencies as well as state and local governments to reduce their expenditures under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty, not to exercise options to renew contracts or to delay or not originate new contracts. Any of those actions could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. Moreover, although our contracts with governmental entities may contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, government entities usually must approve funds for a given program each government fiscal year and may significantly reduce or eliminate funding for a program. Significant reductions in these appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additional factors that could have a serious adverse effect on our government contracting business include, but may not be limited to:\n\u25cf\nchanges in government programs or requirements;\n\u25cf\nbudgetary priorities limiting or delaying government spending generally, or by specific departments or agencies and changes in fiscal policies or available funding, including potential governmental shutdowns;\n\u25cf\nreductions in the government's use of technology solutions firms;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the number of contracts reserved for small businesses, or small business set asides, which could result in our inability to compete directly for these prime contracts; and\n\u25cf\ncurtailment of the government use of IT or related professional services.\nThe Office of Management and Budget process for ensuring government agencies properly support capital planning initiatives, including information technology investments, could reduce or delay federal information technology spending and cause us to lose revenue.\nThe Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, supervises spending by federal agencies, including enforcement of the Government Performance Results Act. This Act requires, among other things, that federal agencies make an adequate business justification to support capital planning initiatives, including all information technology investments. The factors considered by the OMB include, among others, whether the proposed information technology investment is expected to achieve an appropriate return on investment, whether related processes are contemporaneously reviewed, whether inter-operability with existing systems and the capacity for these systems to share data across government has been considered, and whether existing off-the-shelf products are being utilized to the extent possible. If our clients do not adequately justify proposed information technology investments to the OMB, the OMB may refuse funding for their new or continuing information technology investments, and we may lose revenue as a result.\nOur contracts with federal, state and local governments may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that give the U.S. Government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the U.S. Government to:\n\u25cf\nterminate our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nreduce potential future revenues from our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nmodify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the U.S. Government or with any specific government agency;\n\u25cf\nimpose fines and penalties;\n\u25cf\nsubject us to criminal prosecution;\n\u25cf\nsubject the award of some contracts to protest or challenge by competitors, which may require the contracting U.S. agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest or challenge and which may also require the government to solicit new bids for the contract or result in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract;\n\u25cf\nsuspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related task orders if the necessary funds are not appropriated by Congress;\n\u25cf\ndecline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiple year contract; and\n\u25cf\nclaim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nThe U.S. Government may terminate a contract with us either for convenience (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs or its desire to consolidate work under another contract) or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract with us for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract with us based upon our default, we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may in the future receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the U.S. Government's satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\nOur U.S. Government contracts typically have terms of one or more base years and one or more option years. Many of the option periods cover more than half of the contract's potential term. U.S. Governmental agencies generally have the right not to exercise options to extend a contract. A decision to terminate or not to exercise options to extend our existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our U.S. Government contracts also contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that could limit our ability to compete for certain related follow-on contracts. For example, when we work on the design of a solution, we may be precluded from competing for the contract to install that solution. While we actively monitor our contracts to avoid these conflicts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid all organizational conflict of interest issues.\nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts are frequently awarded only after formal competitive bidding processes, which have been and may continue to be protracted, and typically impose provisions that permit cancellation if funds are unavailable to the public agency.\nThe competitive bidding process presents several risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe expend substantial funds, managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we win, which could result in substantial cost overruns; and\n\u25cf\nwe may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in a requirement to resubmit bids on modified specifications or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nUnfavorable government audits could require us to refund payments we have received, to forgo anticipated sales and could subject us to penalties and sanctions.\nThe federal, state and local government entities we work for generally have the authority to audit and review our contracts with them and/or our subcontracts with prime contractors. As part of that process, the government agency reviews our performance on the contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If the audit agency determines that we have improperly received payment or reimbursement, we would be required to refund any such amount. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government. Any such unfavorable determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for new work which would have a negative impact on our business.\nThe failure by federal, state and local governments to approve budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and solutions and cause us to lose future revenues.\nOn an annual basis, Congress, and state and local governments must approve budgets that govern spending by government entities that we support. In years when governments do not complete the budget process before the end of their fiscal year, governments may fund operations pursuant to a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution allows U.S. Government agencies and other government entities to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle. When the government operates under a continuing resolution, it may delay funding we expect to receive from clients on work we are already performing and will likely result in new initiatives being delayed or in some cases cancelled.\nOur gross margin from our contracts will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs.\nOur gross profit margin is largely a function of the rates we charge for our IT Services and the utilization rate, or chargeability, of our employees. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our employees, we will not be able to sustain our gross profit margin and earn a sufficient amount to fund our operating expenses. The rates we charge for our IT Services are affected by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour clients' perception of our ability to add value through our services;\n\u25cf\ncompetition;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\npricing policies of our competitors; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions.\nOur utilization rates are also affected by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nseasonal trends, primarily because of holidays, vacations, and slowdowns by our clients, which may have a more significant effect in the fourth quarter;\n\u25cf\nour ability to transition employees from completed engagements to new engagements;\n\u25cf\nour ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriately balanced and sized workforce; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to manage employee turnover.\nWe have implemented cost-management programs to manage our costs, including personnel costs, support and other overhead costs. Some of our costs, like office rents, are fixed in the short term, which limits our ability to reduce costs in periods of declining sales. Our current and future cost-management initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain our margins as our level of sales varies.\nIf we fail to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, our ability to compete for future work and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The provisions we typically include in our contracts which are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions. It is possible, because of the nature of our business, that we may be exposed to legal claims in the future. We have errors and omissions insurance with coverage limits of $1 million, subject to a $100,000 deductible payable by us. The policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities. As a consulting firm, we depend on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality services to retain and attract clients and employees. As a result, claims made against us may damage our reputation, which in turn, could impact our ability to compete for new business.\nThe IT services industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many participants. We believe that we currently compete principally with other IT professional services firms, technology vendors and the internal information systems groups of our clients. Many of the companies that provide services in our markets have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our marketplace continues to experience rapid changes in its competitive landscape. Some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with better-capitalized partners. These changes may create more or larger and better-capitalized competitors with enhanced abilities to compete for market share generally and our clients specifically, in some cases, through significant economic incentives to clients to secure contracts. These competitors may also be better able to compete for skilled professionals by offering them large compensation incentives. One or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting the competitors' profit margins. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced, and expect to continue to face, competition from new entrants into our markets. As a result, we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with our existing or any new competitors.\nWe may lose money on some contracts if we do not accurately estimate the expenses, time, and resources necessary to satisfy our contractual obligations.\nWe may originate two types of government contracts for our services: time-and-materials and fixed-price. Each of these types of contracts, to varying degrees, involves some risk that we could underestimate our cost of fulfilling the contract, which may reduce the profit we earn or lead to a financial loss on the contract.\nUnder time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. We assume financial risk on time and material contracts because we assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a fixed price. Compared to cost-plus contracts, fixed price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities, but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns and bear the risk of underestimating the level of effort required to perform the contractual obligations, which could result in increased costs and expenses.\nOur profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities, our ability to successfully bid for new business may be adversely affected.\nTo develop new business opportunities, we rely on establishing and maintaining relationships with various government entities. We may be unable to successfully maintain our relationships with government entities, and any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully for new business.\nOur business may suffer if our facilities or our employees are unable to obtain or retain the security clearances or other qualifications needed to perform services for our clients.\nMany of our U.S. Government contracts require employees and facilities used in specific engagements to hold security clearances and to clear National Agency Checks and Defense Security Service checks. Some of our contracts require us to employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If our employees or our facilities lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances or successfully clear necessary National Agency or Defense Security Service checks, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them, and in each instance our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe must comply with a variety of laws, regulations and procedures and our failure to comply could harm our operating results.\nWe must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts which affect how we do business with our clients and impose added costs on our business. For example, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the industrial security regulations of the Department of Defense and related laws include provisions that:\n\u25cf\nallow U.S. Government entities to terminate or not renew contracts if we come under foreign ownership, control or influence;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to disclose and certify cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information; and\n\u25cf\nrequire us to comply with laws and regulations intended to promote various social or economic goals.\nWe are subject to industrial security regulations of the U.S. Government agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners' access to classified information. If we were to come under foreign ownership, control or influence, we could lose our facility security clearance, which could result in our U.S. Government clients terminating or deciding not to renew an existing contract, and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\nIn addition, our employees and independent contractors must often comply with procedures required by the specific agency for which work is being performed, such as time recordation or prohibition on removal of materials from a location.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or procedures, including U.S. Government procurement regulations and regulations regarding the protection of classified information, could result in contract termination, loss of security clearances, suspension or prohibition from contracting with government entities, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nFederal, state and local governments may revise their procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.\nFederal, state and local governments may revise their procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. New contracting methods may be adopted relating to GSA contracts, government-wide contracts, or new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain social or other policy objectives, such as establishing new set-aside programs for small or minority-owned businesses. In addition, government entities may face restrictions from new legislation or regulations, as well as pressure from government employees and their unions, on the nature and amount of services they may obtain from private contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are put up for re-competition bid. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, and could harm our operating results. For example, the Truthfulness, Responsibility and Accountability in Contracting Act, proposed in 2001, would have limited and severely delayed the U.S. Government's ability to use private service contractors. Although this proposal was not enacted, it or similar legislation could be proposed at any time. Any reduction in the U.S. Government's use of private contractors to provide federal information technology services could materially adversely impact our business.\nFailure to maintain strong relationships with government\nand commercial contractors could result in a decline in our sales.\nWe derived approximately 80% of our sales in 2016 from contracts under which we acted as a subcontractor. Our subcontracts with prime contractors contain many of the same provisions as the prime contracts and therefore carry many of the same risks previously identified in these Risk Factors. As a subcontractor, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract by others could tarnish our reputation, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a significant portion of our sales in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our sales and operating results could be materially adversely affected if any prime contractor chooses to offer services of the type that we provide or if any prime contractor teams with other companies to independently provide those services.\nOur sales may suffer if our provisional patent application for the technology used by our product, Nodeware, is not approved.\nIn May 2016, we filed a provisional patent application for our proprietary product, Nodeware, to protect the technology that we developed and applied. The provisional patent needs to be finalized by June 2017 and therefore does not have the full protection until it is fully approved. This may provide an opportunity for our competitors to develop similar products and technologies and directly compete with us. This may harm our sales and our ability to earn a return on our investments in this technology.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe that our intellectual property is an asset that may contribute to the growth and profitability of our business. We rely on a combination of patent and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and no patents may ultimately issue from any patent applications we have made or may make. Any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology or be enforceable at all. We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying or use. If we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time consuming and expensive. It could divert management\u2019s attention and may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are not successful in cost effectively protecting our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we or our channel partners fail to properly complete cybersecurity assessments and other projects for customers, the customers may assert that we have contributed to cybersecurity issues that they may incur and seek recourse from us.\nWe perform cybersecurity assessments and other projects for our customers. We issue reports that state the results of our work. If a customer encounters a cybersecurity issue, it may assert that we did not identify and suggest remediation for the issue.\nOur channel partners use our Nodeware scanner in cybersecurity projects. Our channel partners may incur the same risks that we incur in completing cybersecurity projects using Nodeware.\nFor any security breaches against customers that use our Nodewarescanner or services, breaches against those customers may result in customers and the public believing that Nodeware or our services failed. Our customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our Nodeware scanner and our services. Real or perceived security breaches of our customers\u2019 networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, declining sales, increased expenses and customer relations issues. Any real or perceived defects in our product and services, or failure of our product and services to detect a vulnerability could result in:\n\u25cf\na loss of existing or potential customers or channel partners;\n\u25cf\ndelayed or lost revenue and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf\na delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;\n\u25cf\nan increase in warranty claims, or an increase in the cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and further harm our reputation.\nThese and other factors could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell our product, Nodeware, to various customers, including those in foreign countries, and we are therefore subject to risks associated with our sales and operations.\nWe ship our product, Nodeware, to customers and resellers domestically and to foreign countries using various carriers. We have a limited history of marketing, selling, and supporting Nodeware. Our Nodeware scanner may be lost or damaged in shipment and we may become responsible for replacing those items. This would reduce our profit margin on these sales.\nOur potential growth in certain markets could be adversely affected by:\n\u25cf\ntrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;\n\u25cf\nimport, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to foreign shipments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping our product to certain countries or markets; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at geographic points of exit and entry for our product.\nThese and other factors could harm our ability to generate future revenue and impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial performance may suffer.\nIn operating our business, we must address quality issues associated with our product, services, and solutions, including defects in engineering, design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, including defects in third-party components used in our product and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third party contractors or their employees. To address quality issues, we test our product to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the product, services, and solutions that we offer may be complex, and our testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our product, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payment and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability. After products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If our customers are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe store various proprietary information or confidential data relating to our business. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data due to fraud or other forms of deception, could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us or harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nWe depend on third party vendors and incur risks associated with cloud based technologies and our product, Nodeware.\nWe store certain information in a cloud based environment with third party vendors. We are dependent on them to maintain a high level of security to protect our information and may incur adverse consequence if each vendor does not provide sufficient security.\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nWe are highly leveraged, which increases our operating deficit and makes it difficult for us to grow.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had current liabilities of approximately $2.75 million and long-term liabilities of $1.7 million. We had a working capital deficit of approximately $2.4 million and a current ratio of .11. Working capital shortages may impair our business operations and growth strategy, and accordingly, our business, operations, and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe have been dependent on a limited number of high net worth individuals to fund our working capital needs.\nFrom 2003 through 2016 we received approximately $4.1 million in a combination of equity, debt conversion and debt transactions from a limited number of high net worth investors. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to raise additional capital from this group of investors, or that we will be able to secure funding from additional sources.\nAt December 31, 2016, we have current notes payable of approximately $368,000 to third parties, which includes convertible notes payable of approximately $296,000. We have current maturities of long-term obligations of approximately $837,000 to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC). Included in the balance of $837,000 is $570,000 due to the PBGC in accordance with the October 2011 Settlement Agreement. Payments are contingent upon our earning free cash flow in excess of defined amounts which vary by year. No amounts have been owed or paid on this obligation through 2016. However, if no amounts are obligated to be paid for 2017, we anticipate that we will write off the balance at December 31, 2017 and, if so, realize a non-cash gain. Since we are not current with our periodic payments to the PBGC, all principal on our note payable of $246,000 was recorded as a current liability at December 31, 2016. We have maturities of our long-term notes to third parties of $265,000 due on January 1, 2018 and $175,000 due on August 31, 2018. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to repay current notes payable or obtain extensions of maturity dates for long-term notes payable when they mature or that we will be able to repay or otherwise refinance the notes at their scheduled maturities.\nWe may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms.\nWe may require additional funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We cannot provide assurance that adequate additional financing will be available or, if available, will be offered on acceptable terms.\nMoreover, our IT services billings generate accounts receivable that are generally paid within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. The cost of those sales generally consists of employee salaries and benefits that we must pay prior to our receipt of the accounts receivable to which these costs relate. We therefore need sufficient cash resources to cover such employee-related costs which, in many cases, require us to borrow funds at costly terms.\nWe have secured an accounts receivable financing line of credit from an independent financial institution that allows us to sell selected accounts receivable invoices to the financial institution with full recourse against us in the amount of $2 million, including a sublimit for one major client of $1.5 million. This provides us with the cash needed to finance certain costs and expenses. At December 31, 2016, we had financing availability, based on eligible accounts receivable, of approximately $143,000 under this line. We pay fees based on the length of time that the invoice remains unpaid. As we grow, additional working capital may be required to support this difference in the timing of cash receipts versus payroll disbursements. Moreover, our accounts receivable financing lender may decide to cease subsequent advances at any time in its discretion, upon our failure to meet certain contractual requirements or upon the occurrence of certain events or contingencies that are out of our control. In such event, our short-term cash requirements would exceed available cash on hand resulting in material adverse consequences to our business.\nFinally, any additional equity financing and conversions by the holders of existing notes payable to common stock will be dilutive to stockholders. Debt financings, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that further limit our ability to make decisions that we believe will be in our best interests. If we cannot obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us when required, our operations will be materially adversely affected and we may have to cease or substantially reduce operations.\nWe rely on two customers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe depend on two customers for a large portion of our revenue. During 2016, sales to one client, including sales under subcontracts for services to several entities, accounted for 60.5% of total sales and 34.0% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. Sales to another client, which consisted of sales under subcontracts, accounted for 22.4% of sales in and 28.5% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. The loss of one of these customers or a material subcontract with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and harm our business and results of operations.\nEvents affecting the credit markets may restrict our ability to access additional financing.\nOver the last several years, the U.S. and worldwide capital and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in certain financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, costlier, and in some cases, have resulted in the unavailability of financing. Continued uncertainty and volatility in the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business, including our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our ability to fund current operations or expand our business. These events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our debt and equity securities.\nIf we acquire businesses or business assets and do not successfully integrate the acquisitions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may grow our business by acquiring or investing in companies and businesses and assets that we feel have synergy and will complement our business plan. As such, we periodically evaluate potential business combinations and investments in other companies and assets. We may be unable to profitably manage businesses and assets that we may acquire or invest in. We may fail to integrate these businesses and assets successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur investments in cybersecurity and other business initiatives may not be successful.\nWe have invested in and continue to invest in cybersecurity capabilities to add new products and services to address the needs of our clients, including our newly introduced product, Nodeware. Our investments may not be successful or increase our revenues. If we are not successful in creating value from our investments by increasing sales, our financial condition and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we fail to adequately manage the size of our business, it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results or stock price.\nOur management believes that to be successful we must appropriately manage the size of our business. This may mean reducing costs and overhead in certain economic periods, and selectively growing in periods of economic expansion. In addition, we will be required to implement operational, financial and management information procedures and controls that are efficient and appropriate for the size and scope of our operations. The management skills and systems currently in place may not be adequate and we may not be able to manage any significant reductions or growth effectively.\nWe may have difficulties in managing our growth.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to expand, train and manage our employee base and provide support to an expanded client base. We must also enhance and implement new operating and software systems to accommodate our growth and expansion of IT product and service offerings. If we cannot manage growth effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial condition. In addition, acquisitions, investments and expansion involve substantial infrastructure costs and working capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to integrate acquisitions, if any, and expansions efficiently. Similarly, we cannot provide assurance that any investments or expansion will enhance our profitability. If we do not achieve sufficient sales growth to offset increased expenses associated with our expansion, our results will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the continued services of our key personnel.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the continuing efforts of our senior executive officers. The loss of any of these key employees may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees.\nWe believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to train, retain, effectively manage and attract highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. This includes skills for our new initiatives in cybersecurity. Employee turnover is generally high in the IT services industry. If our efforts in these areas are not successful, our costs may increase, our sales efforts may be hindered, and the quality of our client service may suffer. Although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees, there is often significant competition for certain personnel in the IT services industry. From time to time, we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations, or with required specific expertise.\nWe may lose revenue and our cash flow and profitability could be negatively affected if expenditures are incurred prior to final receipt of a contract or contract funding modification.\nWe provide professional services and sometimes procure materials on behalf of our clients under various contract arrangements. From time to time, to ensure that we satisfy our clients\u2019 delivery requirements and schedules, we may elect, based on verbal authorization, to initiate procurements or provide services in advance of receiving formal written contractual authorization from the government client or a prime contractor. If our government or prime contractor requirements should change or the government directs the anticipated procurement to a contractor other than us, or if the materials become obsolete or require modification before we are under contract for the procurement, our investment might be at risk. If we do not receive the required funding, our cost of services incurred that exceed contractual funding may not be recoverable. This could reduce anticipated revenue or result in a loss, negatively affecting our cash flow and profitability.\nOur employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could cause us to lose contracts.\nWhile we have ethics and compliance programs in place, we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur. We may enter into arrangements with prime contractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute contracts or programs. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur. Misconduct by employees, prime contractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws, including U.S. Government procurement regulations, proper handling of sensitive or classified information, compliance with the terms of our contracts that we receive, and falsifying time records or failures to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to us. These actions could lead to civil, criminal, and/or administrative penalties (including fines, imprisonment, suspension and/or bars from performing U.S. Government contracts) and harm our reputation. The precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, and such misconduct by employees, prime contractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or harm to our reputation, which could cause us to lose contracts or cause a reduction in revenue.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nCertain stockholders own a significant portion of our stock and may delay or prevent a change in control or adversely affect the stock price through sales in the open market.\nAs of March 20, 2017, one related party and one third party, who is a former member of the board of directors, hold convertible notes payable with the right to convert the notes payable and accrued interest into shares of common stock at $.05 per share. If these parties converted all principal and accrued interest into common stock, these two individuals would own approximately 13.2%, 29.2%, respectively, (42.4% in the aggregate of our then outstanding common stock, excluding stock options and warrants). However, such notes may not be converted if such conversion would result in a change in control which would limit the use of our net operating loss carryforwards. We estimate as of the date of this report that substantially all convertible notes payable and accrued interest due to all related parties could be converted to shares of common stock, without affecting a change of control that would limit the use of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe concentration of large percentages of ownership by a single stockholder or a few stockholders may delay or prevent a change in control. Additionally, the sale of a significant number of our shares in the open market by a single stockholder or otherwise could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the possible issuance of shares to third parties upon conversion of outstanding notes.\nWe have three convertible notes outstanding to third parties that are convertible into shares of common stock at prices ranging from $.05 to $.25 per share. If these notes were converted into common stock, the holders would receive 4,700,000 shares of our common stock or approximately 13.9% of our common stock then outstanding as of March 20, 2017.\nOur stock price is volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and will continue to be subject to volatility in the trading markets and other factors.\nThe closing market price for our common stock varied between a low of $.01 and a high of $.085 in 2016. This volatility may affect the price at which a stockholder could sell its shares of common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the Over The Counter (OTC) Bulletin Board. Because there is a limited public market for our common stock, a stockholder may not be able to sell shares when he or she wants. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will ever develop.\nThere is limited trading in our common stock and we cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will ever develop. The lack of an active public trading market means that a stockholder may not be able to sell shares of common stock when wanted, thereby increasing market risk. Until our common stock is listed on an exchange, we expect that the shares will continue to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations regarding the common stock\u2019s market value. In addition, if we failed to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the shares liquidity. Moreover, our ability to obtain future financing may be adversely affected by the consequences of our common stock trading on the OTC Bulletin Board.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and may be difficult to buy or sell.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is currently below $5.00 per share and therefore may be designated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.", "PERMNO": 79595, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "IMCI"}
