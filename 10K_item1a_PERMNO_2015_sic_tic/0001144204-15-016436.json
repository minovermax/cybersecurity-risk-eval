RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the prospectus associated with our initial public offering and the Registration Statement, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Videocon d2h and the Industry in which Videocon d2h operates.\nVideocon d2h has accumulated losses exceeding its paid-up share capital, which may affect its ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nVideocon d2h has incurred losses for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014 of Rs.3,524.33 million and Rs.3,195.48 million and for the six-month period ended September 30, 2014 of Rs.1,174.24 million. The auditors of Videocon d2h have stated in their audit opinion that the accumulated losses of Videocon d2h exceed its paid up share capital and that Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will not continue to incur losses, or that the auditors of Videocon d2h will continue to prepare the financial statements of Videocon d2h on a going concern basis.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect its financial health and make it more difficult for Videocon d2h to service its debt or obtain additional financing, if necessary.\nAs of September 30, 2014 and February 28, 2015, Videocon d2h had an outstanding secured indebtedness of Rs.28,711.54 million and Rs.32,019.35 million, respectively, from banks and financial institutions, and indebtedness of Rs.2,250.00 million from Videocon Industries Limited (\u201cVideocon Industries\u201d), the Videocon Group\u2019s flagship entity with its securities listed on the BSE Limited, located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India (the \u201cBSE\u201d), the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India (the \u201cNSE\u201d), the Luxemburg Stock Exchange and the Singapore Stock Exchange, on such dates. While Videocon d2h intends to repay certain loans from scheduled banks from the proceeds of the Transaction, it may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Its indebtedness could have several important consequences, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 a portion of Videocon d2h\u2019s cash flows may be used towards payment of principal and interest of its debts, which would reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7 its ability to obtain additional financing in the future at reasonable terms may be restricted;\n\u00b7 Videocon d2h may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures and may have reduced flexibility in responding to changing business, regulatory and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7 Videocon d2h may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have greater financial resources than it.\nAs of March 31, 2014, all of Videocon d2h\u2019s indebtedness consisted of floating rate indebtedness. An increase in prevailing interest rates would increase borrowing costs with respect to existing floating rate obligations or new loans, which may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure of Videocon d2h to adhere to the terms and conditions of its loan agreements could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile Videocon d2h believes that its relationships with its lenders are good, compliance with the various terms and conditions of its loan agreements is subject to interpretation and, as a result, it is possible that a lender could assert that Videocon d2h has not complied with all the terms under its financing agreements. Any failure to service Videocon d2h\u2019s indebtedness, obtain a required consent or perform any condition or covenant could lead to a termination of one or more of its credit facilities, acceleration of amounts due under such facilities and cross-defaults under certain of its other financing agreements, any of which may adversely affect its ability to conduct its business and have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. See - \u201cThe Court of Turin, Italy has, by an ex-parte decree, ordered that Videocon Industries, a Videocon Group entity, pay certain lenders of an erstwhile subsidiary a total principal amount of the loan that the erstwhile subsidiary had incurred, which order may be enforced against Videocon Industries. The enforcement of such order or other events could result in Videocon d2h being in default or cross-default under certain provisions of Videocon d2h loan agreements\u201d.\nCurrently, Videocon d2h is not in compliance with certain terms of its financing agreements relating to repayment of certain outstanding principal amounts and maintenance of certain financial ratios (as described below). However, Videocon d2h\u2019s lenders have neither enforced any security nor have accelerated repayment of the loans for any such non compliance.\nAs of September 30, 2014, Videocon d2h had aggregate overdue payments of principal amounting to Rs.511.10 million. Further, Videocon d2h has been unable to maintain the following financial ratios required to be maintained under its financing arrangements:\n\u00b7 Total debt to promoter contribution ratio of not more than two times (which was 2.65 times as of March 31, 2014);\n\u00b7 Assets coverage ratio of at least one time (which was 0.79 time as of March 31, 2014);\n\u00b7 Debt to EBITDA ratio for fiscal 2014 of not more than 3.5 times (which was 7.03 times as of March 31, 2014); and\n\u00b7 Debt to net cash accruals ratio for fiscal 2014 of not more than 5.5. times (net cash accruals was negative as of March 31, 2014).\nThe restrictive covenants in Videocon d2h\u2019s loan agreements and any of the agreements governing its future indebtedness could adversely restrict its financial and operating flexibility.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s existing loan agreements contain financial and other restrictive covenants. These include certain security margins, financial ratios and restrictive covenants, such as requiring the lender\u2019s consent for, among other things, issuance of new equity shares, undertaking any new project, diversification, modernization or substantial expansion of its DTH operations, formulating any scheme of amalgamation or reconstruction, making any material changes to its constitutional documents, incurring further indebtedness, creating further encumbrances on, or disposing of, its assets, changing its fiscal year and making investments or acquisitions beyond certain limits in a single fiscal year. Future financing documents of Videocon d2h may contain similar or other financial or restrictive covenants. Such covenants may restrict Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to raise additional capital in the future through bank borrowings and debt and equity issuances and may restrict its ability to engage in business transactions that Videocon d2h believes to be of benefit to the company. The occurrence of any of the above events may have a material adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s failure to adhere to the terms and conditions contained in the DTH License Agreement could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Videocon d2h may owe additional amounts under its DTH License Agreement for prior years of operations.\nVideocon d2h entered into the DTH License Agreement, dated December 28, 2007, with the President of India acting through the Director, Broadcasting, Policy and Legislation, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Government of India (the \u201cGoI\u201d), or the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India (\u201cMIB\u201d) (the \u201cDTH License Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the DTH License Agreement, Videocon d2h is required to pay an annual fee of 10.0% of its gross revenue as defined in the DTH License Agreement (\u201cDTH Gross Revenue\u201d) to the MIB for the relevant fiscal year. Separately, Videocon d2h is also required to pay license fees and royalty for the spectrum it uses, as determined by the Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Department of Telecommunications, GoI.\nThe DTH license is valid until December 12, 2018, unless terminated earlier for transfer of the DTH license without prior approval from the MIB, default or insolvency. The DTH license may be terminated by the MIB without compensation to Videocon d2h in the event of breach of any of the terms and conditions of the license (after allowing Videocon d2h an opportunity to address the breach), including, among other things, if it becomes bankrupt or otherwise insolvent or applies for being adjudicated as insolvent or bankrupt. Among other restrictions under the DTH License Agreement, any change in the equity structure of Videocon d2h requires consultation with, and prior approval from, the MIB. If the DTH License Agreement is terminated or is not renewed, Videocon d2h would lose the ability to provide DTH services in India and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, pay DTH operators, including Videocon d2h, are disputing the license fee with the MIB. These pay DTH operators have claimed, under the respective disputes filed before the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (the \u201cTDSAT\u201d) that the MIB\u2019s entitlement to levy a license fee on the DTH Gross Revenue of the relevant pay DTH operators is restricted to revenue arising out of the licensed activities of the pay DTH operators, and does not extend to any income that may otherwise be earned by the pay DTH operators, such as interest and rental income, among others. The TDSAT in 2008 passed orders in favor of the pay DTH operators and held that the license fee payable by such pay DTH operators is required to be calculated only on the basis of revenue earned from their licensed activities net of certain permitted deductions (\u201cAdjusted DTH Gross Revenue\u201d). The GoI has filed appeals before the Supreme Court of India against the TDSAT\u2019s 2008 orders, which are currently pending adjudication.\nVideocon d2h has since the commencement of its DTH operations paid license fees to the MIB, calculated on the basis of Adjusted DTH Gross Revenue. Pursuant to Videocon d2h\u2019s letter to the MIB dated February 23, 2011 relating to the submission of the statement of Adjusted DTH Gross Revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 and payment of its license fee, the MIB issued a letter on April 18, 2011 acknowledging the receipt of the license fee, but stated that such acknowledgement was without prejudice to the rights and contentions raised in the appeals filed by the GoI against the TDSAT\u2019s 2008 orders and other special leave petitions pending before the Supreme Court of India and that such acknowledgement was subject to verification of Videocon d2h\u2019s final audited accounts. The MIB further noted that the acknowledgement would not constitute the final settlement of the license fees and that the GoI reserves its rights to raise further claims, to call for additional information in order to confirm that the license fees have been paid in full and to take any other action as it may deem fit to recover such amounts. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the GoI and Videocon d2h is required to pay additional DTH license fees attributable to computation based on DTH Gross Revenue instead of Adjusted DTH Gross Revenue, Videocon d2h may incur additional liability and its business financial condition of operations may be adversely affected. Videocon d2h makes an estimation of and discloses such potential liability in its financial statements as a contingent liability. For the period since incorporation until September 30, 2014, such potential liability is estimated to be Rs.3,037.68 million (inclusive of interest as of March 19, 2014 on liability accruing until March 31, 2013), as per Videocon d2h\u2019s financial statements (restated) as of September 30, 2014.\nThrough a demand notice dated March 24, 2014, the MIB raised a demand against Videocon d2h for an aggregate amount of Rs.1,582.89 million towards outstanding license fees (together with interest at the rate of 1% per month) for periods until March 31, 2013, which Videocon d2h has challenged.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s leased satellite ST-2 is subject to operational, lease and environmental risks that could limit Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to utilize the satellite.\nVideocon d2h leases bandwidth on the ST-2 satellite (the \u201cST-2 satellite\u201d) of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (\u201cSingTel\u201d) pursuant to a Ku-Band Lease Agreement which expires on April 14, 2015. Videocon d2h is in the process of securing a renewed lease agreement.\nOperational risks: ST-2 satellite was launched in May 2011 and it has an estimated useful life of 12 to 15 years. It is subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions that may occur as a result of various factors, such as the satellite manufacturer\u2019s errors or operational failures. The satellite is also subject to a variety of atmospheric risks while in orbit that may adversely affect operations, including meteoroid strikes, electrostatic storms, increased solar activity and collisions with space debris. In the event ST-2 satellite experiences a technical failure, is damaged or is lost, Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to provide programming to its subscribers could be seriously disrupted or suspended, even for prolonged periods, as Videocon d2h does not have any additional back-up satellite. In the event of such failure, damage or loss, Videocon d2h could not effectively operate its business and may be required to incur significant capital expenditure to restore its operations, including by obtaining replacement satellite capacity. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h would be able to restore its operations or obtain replacement capacity in a timely manner, or at all. If replacement satellite capacity is not available to Videocon d2h immediately on another satellite at the same geostationary position as the ST-2 satellite, Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to continue to provide its programming offerings would be jeopardized, which would adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Videocon d2h does not carry any business interruption insurance to cover such losses and, in such event, it is not certain when, if ever, it would be able to resume operations.\nLease risks: Videocon d2h does not own any satellites and has previously entered into a Ku-Band Lease Agreement, dated April 19, 2012, as amended on June 19, 2013 (the \u201cKu-Band Lease Agreement\u201d), with the Department of Space, GoI (the \u201cDepartment of Space\u201d), which provided for the lease of Ku-band space segment capacity on the ST-2 satellite of SingTel until February 28, 2015. Although the Ku-Bank Lease Agreement is now expired, Videocon d2h continues to utilize the satellite capacity under the terms of the expired agreement. Typically, the Department of Space enters into lease agreements for a period of up to 3 years and the agreements are renewed from time to time. While Videocon d2h believes that it will be able to secure a renewed lease agreement in the near future, there can be no assurance that such an agreement will be secured in a timely manner, or at all. If Videocon d2h is unable to secure suitable replacement satellite transmission capacity, Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nVideocon d2h expects that any renewed lease agreement for the Ku-Band Lease Agreement will be on substantially similar terms. Under the Ku-Band Lease Agreement, in the event that Videocon d2h fails to meet its payment obligations for two consecutive months or breaches a provision or fails to perform an obligation and does not cure such breach within 20 days of receiving written notice from the Department of Space, the Department of Space has a right to terminate the Ku-Band Lease Agreement. In the event of such termination by the Department of Space, Videocon d2h would be required to pay certain early termination charges. Also, while Videocon d2h currently believes that it will have sufficient satellite capacity to transmit its existing and planned programming offerings following replacement of the Ku-Band Lease Agreement, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to continue to lease such capacity or additional capacity on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If any replacement lease agreement is terminated or expires and Videocon d2h is unable to secure suitable replacement satellite transmission capacity, Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Ku-Band Lease Agreement, Videocon d2h is, and Videocon d2h expects that pursuant to any renewed lease agreement it will be, required to pay a monthly fee in Indian rupees to the commercial division of the Department of Space, Government of India (the \u201cAntrix Corporation\u201d) (which fee is equivalent to 1,791,667 U.S. Dollars for the Ku-Band Lease Agreement). Consequently, if the Indian rupee declines in value as compared to the U.S. Dollar, or if the amounts payable under any future lease agreement increase materially, Videocon d2h will be required to make larger payments in Indian rupees. Any early termination charges and/or increased payments as a result of currency fluctuations may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of Videocon d2h\u2019s operations are currently located in a single digital broadcast center in Noida, India.\nAlthough Videocon d2h is proposing to set up an additional broadcast site at Bharuch in Gujarat as a back-up to its existing broadcast center, a significant portion of Videocon d2h\u2019s operations are still currently located in a single digital broadcast center in Noida, India. As a result, Videocon d2h is vulnerable to the effects of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood or fire, or other calamity or event, such as technological failure, that would cause significant damage to this facility and/or disrupt its ability to conduct its business. In the event of a significant disruptive event affecting this facility, Videocon d2h may face disruptions in the delivery of programming or degradation in the audio-visual quality of such programming.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the facility\u2019s lease agreement (the \u201cNoida Lease Agreement\u201d), executed between Videocon d2h and the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (the \u201cGNIDA\u201d), Videocon d2h is required to comply with certain terms and conditions, including providing prior written notice to the GNIDA in respect of any change in its capital structure, among other things. If Videocon d2h is in default of the terms of the Noida Lease Agreement, the GNIDA may terminate the lease, in which case Videocon d2h would be required to vacate the facility. If Videocon d2h\u2019s operations at its digital broadcast center in Noida are disrupted for any reason, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nVideocon d2h has had overdue payments under some of its loan agreements.\nVideocon d2h has had aggregate overdue payments of principal of Rs.511.10 million as of September 30, 2014 under certain loan agreements. In addition, during the period from October 1, 2014 through March 2015, Videocon d2h has been delayed in making payments under certain of its loan agreements from time to time. In the event of its failure to make timely payments to its lenders, such lenders may issue a notice declaring an event of default under each of these loan agreements. However, Videocon d2h\u2019s lenders have neither enforced any security nor have accelerated repayments of the loans for any such non-compliance. While Videocon d2h intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the Transaction to pay off some outstanding debts, should Videocon d2h fail to comply with the covenants of its various loans in time, or fail to make timely payments to its lenders in the future, and its lenders elect to accelerate any or all amounts outstanding under the relevant loan agreements and declare such amounts immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, it could have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, a default by Videocon d2h under the terms of any loan agreement also constitutes a cross-default under other financing agreements entered into by Videocon d2h. Such default could result in the acceleration of amounts due under those facilities, which may individually or in the aggregate have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Videocon d2h may have to dedicate a substantial portion of its future cash flow from operations to repay the debts under the financing agreements, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to meet working capital requirements and use for other general corporate purposes. Such continued defaults and any action initiated by a lender may also impact Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to obtain financing from banks and financial institutions in the future and may result in a decline in the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and the trading price of the ADSs causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nA significant portion of Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholding is pledged as security to banks and financial institutions.\nCertain of Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholders have pledged an aggregate of 53.44% as of September 30, 2014 of their total shareholding in Videocon d2h to banks and financial institutions in connection with Videocon d2h\u2019s existing indebtedness, in addition to executing undertakings (along with powers of attorney) not to transfer or dispose of an additional 21% of their shareholding in Videocon d2h.\nIn the event of enforcement of pledges on such encumbered equity shares for any reason (including any default under the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements pursuant to which such pledges have been created), such pledged equity shares may be required to be transferred to third parties in favor of which the pledges were created, resulting in a change in Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholding pattern, which may adversely affect its ability to carry out its business operations and as a result, adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of the ADSs.\nVideocon d2h relies on third parties to provide it with programming and any increase in programming costs or new regulations may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVideocon d2h relies on third party content providers to provide it with programming and its ability to compete successfully depends on its ability to continue to obtain programming for delivery to its subscribers at competitive prices. Content procurement by broadcasting service providers in India, including Videocon d2h, takes place through channel distributors or owners. Under Indian interconnection regulations, all channel owners and distributors are required to offer their content to all broadcasting platforms and operators, including pay DTH services providers such as Videocon d2h, subject to payment of content costs, which are regulated by the GoI. Any change in Indian interconnection regulations that would permit content owners and distributors to refuse to provide such programming to DTH operators or to impose discriminatory terms or conditions, may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to acquire programming in a cost-effective manner, or at all, which would adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, Videocon d2h typically enters into agreements with channel distributors and owners, in order to be able to acquire multiple channels offered by such distributors or owners as a bundle, at negotiated prices (typically below the ceiling prices prescribed by the Indian regulator). Significant content agreements that Videocon d2h has entered into at negotiated rates include those entered into with Taj Television (India) Private Limited, Sun TV Network Limited, MSM Discovery Private Limited and IndiaCast UTV Media Distribution Private Limited. Videocon d2h\u2019s programming agreements generally have terms ranging from one to five years and contain various renewal and termination provisions.\nAlthough Videocon d2h has been able to readily renew its contracts with its major content providers, it may not be able to renew them on favorable terms in the future, in a timely manner, or at all, if the market environment changes due to new regulations or increase in content costs for the channel distributors. If Videocon d2h is unable to renew its material content agreements, its programming costs may increase. If Videocon d2h is unable to pass on such increased programming costs to its subscribers, or if such increase in the subscribers fees leads to increased subscriber churn or inability to add to its subscriber base, Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, Videocon d2h has paid its content fees after the due date under its major content agreements from time to time, and the content providers are entitled to terminate the agreement within 21 - 45 days after serving a written demand for payment if payment has not been received by the due date. None of the content providers have sought to terminate the agreements due to delayed payments or otherwise since inception, and Videocon d2h believes that it has a good relationship with all of its major content providers. However, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h\u2019s major content providers will not exercise their right to terminate the agreements in the future due to delays in payments for content, and termination of those agreements by the major content providers could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVideocon d2h has entered into, and will continue to enter into transactions with the Videocon Group, as well as other related party transactions, which may involve conflicts of interest and adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s operations.\nVideocon d2h has in the course of its business entered into transactions with the Videocon Group and other related parties. Such transactions carry with them the risk that their terms could benefit related parties, to Videocon d2h\u2019s detriment. Videocon d2h may not negotiate or enforce contractual terms as aggressively with related parties as it may with an unrelated party. In addition, such transactions present difficult conflicts of interest, could result in significant and minor disadvantages to the company and may impair investor confidence. These transactions with the Videocon Group and other related parties could also cause Videocon d2h to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of its business, and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interest of Videocon d2h or its shareholders. While Videocon d2h believes that all such transactions have been conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h could not have achieved more favorable terms had such transactions not been entered into with related parties. Furthermore, it is likely that Videocon d2h may enter into transactions with the Videocon Group and other related parties in the future. We cannot assure you that such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to Videocon d2h\u2019s relationship with the Videocon Group, including Trend Electronics Limited (a Videocon Group entity) could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVideocon d2h benefits from its relationship with the Videocon Group in many ways, such as their reputation, the cross-selling of its services through the Videocon Group, the opportunity to reduce its marketing spend by using Videocon Group\u2019s existing marketing network and goodwill and the Videocon Group\u2019s willingness to guarantee the majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s loan agreements. Videocon d2h\u2019s growth and future success is influenced, in part, by its continued relationship with its the Videocon Group because of the goodwill and market reputation that Videocon Group has established for itself in India, and Videocon d2h relies on such benefits to position itself in the market to attract subscribers. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to continue to take advantage of the benefits of these relationships in the future. If Videocon d2h ceases to benefit from these relationships for any reason, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nVideocon d2h believes that its subscribers, vendors and members of the financial community perceive the \u201cVideocon\u201d brand to be that of a trusted provider of quality products and services. We cannot assure you that the established \u201cVideocon\u201d brand name will not be adversely affected in the future by events that are beyond Videocon d2h\u2019s control, including subscriber complaints or adverse publicity from any other source relating to Videocon d2h or the Videocon Group. Any damage to this brand name, if not immediately and sufficiently remedied, could have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, Videocon d2h\u2019s success depends significantly on its ability to maintain the \u201cVideocon d2h\u201d brand and successfully build the brand image of its new offerings and brand extensions. In order to increase brand recognition and build the brand image of new offerings and brand extensions, Videocon d2h believes it must continue to devote significant time and resources to advertising and promotions. We cannot assure you that these expenses will result in an increase in favorable recognition of Videocon d2h\u2019s brand or a sufficient increase in revenues to cover such advertising and promotional expenses.\nVideocon d2h has entered into a trademark license agreement with CE India Limited (previously Videocon India Limited), a Videocon Group entity, for the use of the \u201cVideocon\u201d and \u201cV\u201d trademarks, which is valid until March 31, 2022. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will continue to have the uninterrupted use and enjoyment of these trademarks, as it may be unable to renew the trademark license agreement on acceptable terms or at all.\nFurther, Videocon d2h has obtained registrations in its name under the Trademarks Act, 1999, as amended for the trademarks \u201cd2h\u201d, \u201cD2H\u201d and \u201cDIRECT HAI CORRECT HAI\u201d, as granted by Mr. Saurabh Pradipkumar Dhoot (Videocon d2h\u2019s Executive Director) to Videocon d2h, under the terms of an agreement dated July 21, 2008. Videocon d2h may not be able to prevent infringement of its trademarks and a passing off action under common law may not provide sufficient protection. Additionally, Videocon d2h may be required to litigate to protect its brands, which may be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. Loss of the rights to use these trademarks may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, Videocon Industries, the flagship entity of the Videocon Group, has made unsecured loans to Videocon d2h from time-to-time. As of September 30, 2014, such outstanding unsecured loans aggregated to Rs.2,250.00 million.\nIn addition, Videocon d2h benefits from its relationship with Trend Electronics Limited (\u201cTEL\u201d). TEL is an Indian contract electronics manufacturer and the sole supplier of set-top boxes for Videocon d2h. In addition, TEL supplies Videocon d2h with a substantial majority of its other consumer premises equipment. For fiscal years 2013 and 2014, the purchase of set-top boxes and other consumer premises equipment from TEL totaled Rs.6,753.48 million and Rs.5,832.32 million, respectively.\nWe cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will continue to benefit from its relationship with TEL or other entities in the Videocon Group. In the event that TEL ceases to be a Videocon Group entity, Videocon d2h may be unable to derive the benefits of sourcing set-top boxes and other consumer premises equipment from TEL, such as reducing time-to-market for new set-top boxes and not being required to pay customs or import duties. If TEL is unable, for any reason, to provide Videocon d2h with a sufficient quantity of set-top boxes or other consumer premises equipment, Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to add additional subscribers would be impaired, which would adversely affect its results of operations. We cannot assure you in such event that Videocon d2h would be able to obtain set-top boxes or other consumer premises equipment from another supplier on terms favorable to Videocon d2h.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s business is regulated and failure to obtain required regulatory approvals or clearances to operate its business, or comply with applicable laws, and any adverse changes in applicable laws could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVideocon d2h is subject to various laws and regulations in India arising from its operations in India, and the terms and conditions set out in the DTH License Agreement, which is effective for a period of 10 years from the date of issue of the wireless operational license (which was issued to Videocon d2h on December 12, 2008), unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Among other conditions, in terms of the DTH License Agreement, Videocon d2h is required to obtain prior approval from the MIB for effecting any change in its equity structure (including in respect of equity shares issued pursuant to the Transaction).\nVideocon d2h is further subject to various regulatory requirements, which may restrict its ability to conduct business. Under the provisions of India\u2019s current Consolidated FDI Policy, effective from April 17, 2014, foreign investment in Videocon d2h is permitted, subject to, among others, the following conditions - up to 49.0% of its paid-up equity share capital under the automatic route, and up to 74.0%, with prior approval of the GoI for foreign investment between 49.0% and 74.0%. Further, the following conditions will be required to be fulfilled, in the event of any foreign investment being brought into Videocon d2h:\n\u00b7 A majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s Directors, chief executive officer, chief officer in charge of technical network operations and chief security officer must be citizens of India;\n\u00b7 Each of Videocon d2h\u2019s Directors, key executive officers such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief security officer, chief technical officer, chief operating officer, any shareholder of Videocon d2h who holds 10.0% or more of its paid-up equity share capital including the ADSs, and any other category of persons as may be specified by the MIB from time to time, have obtained security clearance from the MIB;\n\u00b7 Prior permission of the MIB must be obtained for effecting any changes in Videocon d2h\u2019s board of directors, appointment of Directors and any key executives as mentioned above, and any other executives as may be specified by the MIB from time to time; and\n\u00b7 Security clearance must also be obtained for each foreign personnel likely to be deployed for more than 60 days in a year by way of appointment, contract, consultancy or any other capacity for providing any services to Videocon d2h. Such security clearance is required to be renewed every two years.\nUnder the terms of the Contribution Agreement, it is a condition to our obligation to close the Transaction that Harry E. Sloan and Jeff Sagansky, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, be elected to Videocon d2h\u2019s board of directors. Accordingly, prior to the closing of the Transaction, Videocon d2h must receive security clearance from the MIB in respect of each of Messrs. Sloan and Saganksy (and the alternate directors for each, if any). Videocon d2h is currently in the process of obtaining the requisite MIB approval and clearances.\nWe cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to obtain necessary approvals required from the MIB in the future in a timely manner, or at all, or that it will be able to comply with any further conditions imposed by the MIB while granting such permissions. Further, the MIB has the right to modify, at any time, the laws and regulations applicable to the industry in which Videocon d2h operates, including the Guidelines for Obtaining License for Providing DTH Broadcasting Service in India issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India on March 15, 2001, as amended from time to time (the \u201cDTH Guidelines\u201d), and the terms and conditions of the DTH License Agreement. Videocon d2h\u2019s business could suffer if there are adverse changes to the regulatory environment. Increased regulation or changes in existing regulation may require Videocon d2h to change its business policies and practices and may increase the costs of providing services to subscribers, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Videocon d2h is unable to recover the consumer premises equipment from churned subscribers, there could be a significant erosion of the realizable value of its consumer premises equipment.\nConsumer premises equipment comprised 85.0% of Videocon d2h\u2019s net tangible assets as of September 30, 2014. When subscribers discontinue or terminate services, Videocon d2h is not always able to recover its consumer premises equipment that it has provided on a rental basis to such subscribers. Videocon d2h recognizes a subscriber as a churned subscriber if the subscriber has not made a payment for at least 120 days. As of September 30, 2014, Videocon d2h had experienced a cumulative churn of 2.36 million subscribers since it commenced operations in 2009. If Videocon d2h is unable to recover the consumer premises equipment from such churned subscribers, there could be a significant erosion of the realizable value of its consumer premises equipment.\nVideocon d2h faces intense and increasing competition.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s business is primarily focused on providing DTH pay-TV services, and it has traditionally competed against other DTH pay-TV providers and cable companies, some of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Videocon d2h. Moreover, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies and others may result in, among other things, greater financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling television, broadband and telephone services in competition with Videocon d2h\u2019s services. Videocon d2h and its competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases as well as from first-time purchasers of DTH pay-TV services and cable to DTH switch overs. In addition, because other DTH pay-TV providers may be seeking to attract a greater proportion of their new subscribers from Videocon d2h\u2019s existing subscriber base, Videocon d2h may be required to increase retention spending, which is capital intensive. Competition has intensified in recent years as the DTH pay-TV industry has matured and the growth of digital cable-based pay-TV services offered by digital cable operators. These cable-based pay-TV services have significantly greater capacity, enabling them to offer substantial High Definition (\u201cHD\u201d) programming content as well as bundled services. This increasingly competitive environment may require Videocon d2h to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn. Further, as a result of this increased competitive environment and the maturation of the DTH pay-TV industry, future growth opportunities of Videocon d2h\u2019s DTH pay-TV business may be limited. In addition, Videocon d2h\u2019s margins may be reduced if it is unable to finance its capital needs, duly service its debt obligations or secure other financing when needed, on acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s limited operating history makes evaluating its business and future prospects difficult.\nYou must consider the risks and difficulties Videocon d2h faces as a company with a limited operating history. Videocon d2h commenced its commercial operations in July 2009. As a result, Videocon d2h has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate its past performance and future prospects. Videocon d2h\u2019s business must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new venture, and its growth and sustainability are greatly dependent on its ability to attract subscribers. It may need to alter its business and strategies on an ongoing basis to manage its growth, which may require large capital investments, to compete effectively with more established pay DTH operators in India. We cannot assure you that the growth in Videocon d2h\u2019s subscriber base that it has witnessed during its limited operating history will continue.\nVideocon d2h may not be able to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow to meet its debt obligations.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance its obligations with respect to its indebtedness depends on Videocon d2h\u2019s future financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, competitive and other factors beyond its control. If Videocon d2h cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, it will be in default and, as a result, holders of its debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest on its debt to be due and payable and Videocon d2h could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If Videocon d2h\u2019s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt obligations, Videocon d2h would face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay any expansions and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, restructure its debt or revise or delay its strategic plans. In addition, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h\u2019s operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of its debts in the future. If Videocon d2h is required to take any of the actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to it, or at all, that these actions would enable Videocon d2h to continue to satisfy its capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of its various debt instruments. In addition, any refinancing of its debt could be at higher interest rates and may require Videocon d2h to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations.\nAny failure or inadequacy in the operation of Videocon d2h\u2019s information technology and network systems may have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business operations.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its information technology and network systems. The capacity, reliability and security of Videocon d2h\u2019s information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including its billing systems) are important to the operation of its current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber attacks. Similarly, Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to expand and update its information technology infrastructure in response to its growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of its new service offering initiatives. Videocon d2h\u2019s inability to expand or upgrade its technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security measures, its servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautions Videocon d2h has taken, unanticipated problems affecting its systems could cause failures in its information technology and network systems or disruption in the transmission of signals. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt its ability to provide services to its subscribers or otherwise meet its business obligations in a timely manner would adversely affect subscriber satisfaction. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize Videocon d2h\u2019s customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, its information technology hardware and software infrastructure, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in Videocon d2h\u2019s operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage to Videocon d2h.\nIf Videocon d2h\u2019s information technology systems are subject to a flood, fire or other natural disaster, terrorism, a computer virus, a power loss, other catastrophe or unauthorized access, its operations and customer relations could be adversely affected. Any failure in the operation of its information technology and network systems could result in business interruptions, which may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s reputation, weaken its competitive position and have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Videocon d2h may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and it may be subject to litigation.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s inability to keep pace with technological developments could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the DTH industry, changes occur as new technologies are developed, which could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business and increase its cost of operations. Technological developments within the DTH industry include changes that may result in improved utilization of capacity, more robust content recording features and new interactive content. Consumers may also choose to consume digital media through other platforms, such as computers, mobile phones, tablet computers and other devices capable of being used to view media contents. If Videocon d2h is unable to keep pace with such technological developments, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If new technologies on which Videocon d2h focuses its investments fail to achieve acceptance in the marketplace or its technology does not work and requires significant cost to replace or fix, Videocon d2h could suffer a material adverse effect on its future competitive position, which could cause a reduction in its revenues and earnings. To access technologies and provide products that are necessary for Videocon d2h to remain competitive, Videocon d2h may make future acquisitions and investments and may enter into strategic partnerships with other companies. Such investments may require a commitment of significant capital and human and other resources. The value of such acquisitions, investments and partnerships and the technology accessed may be highly speculative. Arrangements with third parties can lead to contractual and other disputes and dependence on others for the development and delivery of necessary technology that Videocon d2h may not be able to control or influence. Such relationships may commit Videocon d2h to technologies that are rendered obsolete by other developments or preclude the pursuit of other technologies which may prove to be superior.\nIn addition, Videocon d2h\u2019s business is subject to risks relating to increasing competition from other leisure and entertainment activities which occupy consumers\u2019 time. Videocon d2h\u2019s business competes with many other sources of entertainment and information delivery, including broadcast television, films, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, video and computer games, print media, social media and the Internet. Technological advancements, such as new video formats, and the delivery of video content through streaming and downloading services on the Internet, have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. The increasing number of choices available to audiences could adversely affect demand for Videocon d2h\u2019s products and services and changes in technology could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to maintain, expand or upgrade its systems and respond to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with future technological developments. We also cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will successfully anticipate the demand for products and services requiring new technology. Any inability to keep pace with technological changes and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the market, could adversely affect its business and increase its costs of operations.\nThe Court of Turin, Italy has, by an ex-parte decree, ordered that Videocon Industries, a Videocon Group entity, pay certain lenders of an erstwhile subsidiary a total principal amount of the loan that the erstwhile subsidiary had incurred, which order may be enforced against Videocon Industries. The enforcement of such order or other events could result in Videocon d2h being in default or cross-default under certain provisions of Videocon d2h loan agreements.\nIn June 2007, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (\u201cIntesa\u201d) and Banca Intesa Mediocredito S.p.A. (\u201cBanca Intesa\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cLenders\u201d) entered into a loan agreement with VDC Technologies S.p.A. (\u201cVDC\u201d), a company incorporated in Italy, which was then an indirect subsidiary of Videocon Industries, for a maximum principal amount of \u20ac35 million. In relation to the loan to VDC, Videocon Industries issued patronage letters dated June 1, 2007 and June 5, 2007 in favor of Intesa (collectively, the \u201cPatronage Letters\u201d), towards the fulfillment of VDC\u2019s obligations under the loan agreement.\nVDC ceased to be a subsidiary of Videocon Industries in March 2008 which was intimated to Intesa. Since such time, VDC had allegedly defaulted under the terms of the loan agreement. Intesa sought to enforce the Patronage Letters alleging continued default under the loan agreement, including as a result of VDC ceasing to be a subsidiary of Videocon Industries in April 2011, and subsequently initiated injunction proceedings in the Court of Turin, Italy demanding that Videocon Industries fulfill its obligations under the Patronage Letters. The Court of Turin, Italy passed an ex-parte decree against Videocon Industries ordering that it pay Intesa the principal amount of the loan of \u20ac35 million along with other interests and costs incurred, aggregating \u20ac36.2 million.\nRecognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in India are provided for under Section 13 and Section 44 A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (\u201cCPC\u201d). Italy is not recognized as a reciprocating country by the GoI for the purpose of enforcing foreign judgments and, as a result, Intesa will be required to file a suit upon the foreign judgment in the appropriate court in India and obtain a fresh decree against Videocon Industries. Accordingly, Intesa filed a suit on August 21, 2012 in the Bombay High Court against Videocon Industries and served a notice of motion for interim relief pursuant to which Intesa has sought an order to the effect that the judgment passed by the Court of Turin, Italy be declared as valid, binding, conclusive and enforceable against Videocon Industries and that pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit, Videocon Industries be directed to secure the payment due to Intesa by restraining Videocon Industries from alienating or disposing of its assets and property. The Bombay High Court has not granted this ad-interim relief sought by Intesa and the matter is pending a final hearing.\nIntesa has also served Videocon Industries with a legal notice dated July 3, 2012 demanding that payment be made amounting to \u20ac36.7 million plus all agency fees and ancillary costs subject to a maximum of \u20ac38.0 million under the loan agreement and the Patronage Letters and reserved its right to initiate winding up proceedings against Videocon Industries in the event that such payment was not made within three weeks of the receipt of the notice. Videocon Industries had sent a response to the legal notice dated July 28, 2012 denying Intesa\u2019s claim. Intesa filed a winding up petition on October 18, 2012 in the Bombay High Court against Videocon Industries, which by an order dated December 5, 2013, directed that the winding up petition will stand dismissed if Videocon Industries deposits an amount of Rs.2,597.30 million (being equivalent to \u20ac38 million), with the Bombay High Court by January 27, 2014 which Intesa will be entitled to draw. The Bombay High Court further directed that in the event the aforesaid amount is not deposited on or before January 27, 2014, the winding up petition will be admitted without further reference to the court. Videocon Industries filed an appeal (No.(L) No.29/2014) before the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, challenging the order, but the appeal was dismissed by an order dated July 23, 2014. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, by an order dated July 19, 2014, dismissed the appeal filed by Videocon Industries Limited, granted Videocon Industries Limited eight weeks to appeal before the Supreme Court and stayed the implementation of the order dated December 5, 2013. Subsequently, Videocon Industries Limited filed an appeal before the Supreme Court challenging the order of the Bombay High Court dated July 19, 2014. The Supreme Court, by an order dated September 22, 2014, directed that the fixed sum deposited with the Supreme Court (and maturing on October 7, 2014) should be renewed for a period of two years and granted an interim stay on the enforcement of the Bombay High Court\u2019s order dated July 19, 2014.\nFurther, as a result of the alleged violation of the terms of the Patronage Letters together with the ex-parte decree passed by the Court of Turin, Videocon Industries may be determined to be in default under certain of its financing agreements, including a cross-default under the terms and conditions of the unsecured US$200,000,000, 6.75% convertible bonds due 2015 (the \u201cBonds\u201d) issued by Videocon Industries. Any default or declaration of an event of default under the Bonds could have an adverse effect on Videocon Industries\u2019 and the Videocon Group\u2019s financial condition, business and reputation.\nVideocon Industries is the flagship entity of the Videocon Group, a group that Videocon d2h has a strong relationship with. One of the benefits that Videocon d2h enjoys as a result of its relationship with the Videocon Group is that the majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s secured loans were either guaranteed or supported through undertakings by Videocon Industries. Under the terms of these facilities, Videocon d2h may be in default if one of Videocon d2h guarantors (including Videocon Industries) fails to comply with its own debt obligations, defaults under one or more of its loan facilities or if any of such entities\u2019 indebtedness becomes due and payable prior to maturity on account of an event of default. For example, if Videocon Industries were to default under a loan facility or if any of its indebtedness becomes due and payable prior to maturity on amount of an event of default, such event could trigger a series of defaults or cross-defaults under its or Videocon d2h\u2019s loan facilities on which Videocon Industries has provided a guarantee or an undertaking and all outstanding amounts under the Videocon d2h loan facilities could become due and payable immediately, together with accrued interest, which could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s financial condition, business, results of operations and reputation.\nNone of Videocon d2h\u2019s lenders have notified Videocon d2h of an event of default under the terms of any of the loan agreements as a result of the legal proceedings against Videocon Industries in the Intesa matter provided above or otherwise. However, in the event that a lender notifies Videocon d2h of an event of default, such lender could declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable immediately, together with accrued interest, and, in certain instances, enforce their security constituted over Videocon d2h\u2019s various assets and take possession of those assets, which would adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s financial condition, business, results of operations and reputation.\nIn addition, on account of cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions in Videocon d2h\u2019s loan agreements, any notification or declaration of an event of default or a potential event of default under any of Videocon d2h\u2019s loan facilities could result in cross-default and cross-acceleration of all of its outstanding indebtedness as well as payment of penalty interest, which would adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s financial condition, business and results of operations. In addition, if Videocon Industries were declared to be in default of any of their loan facilities, due to Videocon d2h\u2019s relationship with the Videocon Group, any such declaration could have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, prospects and reputation, even if the lenders did not declare Videocon d2h to be in cross-default.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect it against any operational risks or claims.\nVideocon d2h maintains insurance coverage on its Noida digital broadcast center infrastructure assets, and on consumer premises equipment up to the point where Videocon d2h delivers them to its distributors, for a variety of risks, including, among others, risks relating to fire, burglary, earthquake and certain other losses and damages. However, any claim under the insurance policies maintained by Videocon d2h may be subject to certain exceptions, may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and Videocon d2h may not have purchased sufficient insurance to cover all losses that it may incur. Videocon d2h is not insured for certain risks and losses, such as loss of business or business interruption, environmental liabilities and other natural disasters. If Videocon d2h\u2019s insurance coverage does not adequately protect it against any operational risks or claims, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, in the future, insurance coverage may not be available to Videocon d2h on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe success of Videocon d2h\u2019s business is substantially dependent on its executive officers and technical teams.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s ability to sustain its growth and succeed in the future depends on its ability to attract, hire, train and retain skilled personnel. Videocon d2h believes that there is a significant demand for personnel who possess the skills needed in its business. The DTH industry has witnessed a significant number of new entrants and the competition for talent has intensified. Any increase in the rate of attrition of Videocon d2h\u2019s experienced employees would adversely affect its business. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be successful in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of executive officers and technical teams with the requisite skills to replace those personnel who leave. Further, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to re-deploy and re-train its personnel to keep pace with continuing changes in its business.\nVideocon d2h may be unable to manage its growth effectively.\nSince the commencement of Videocon d2h\u2019s operations, its subscriber base and total revenue have grown rapidly. Videocon d2h\u2019s gross DTH subscriber base has increased from approximately 0.44 million as of March 31, 2010 to 11.82 million as of September 30, 2014, according to Indian DTH Market Overview - Key Dynamics & Future Outlook 2015, a report prepared by Media Partners Asia, Ltd, an independent provider of information services, focusing on media, communications, and entrainment industries (the \u201cMPA Report\u201d). Videocon d2h\u2019s total revenue has increased from Rs.142.07 million for fiscal year 2010 to Rs.17,644.10 million for fiscal year 2014. In order to manage its continued growth effectively, Videocon d2h must continue to increase its subscriber base, acquire programming offerings, manage the selection of programming it offers, including the structuring of subscriber packages, introduce new models of set-top boxes and additional service features, develop and improve its operational, financial and other controls, keep pace with technological advancements, effectively withstand pricing and other competitive pressures, effectively manage a growing labor force and hire, train and retain skilled personnel for its management and technical teams. If Videocon d2h is unable to manage its growth effectively, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nVideocon d2h experiences seasonal fluctuations in its business.\nVideocon d2h is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in its business. India\u2019s DTH market is affected by seasonal factors, such as Diwali and other regional festivals and sports events, especially cricket tournaments such as the ICC Cricket World Cup. Other seasonal sporting events that could affect the demand in the DTH industry are major football leagues and the Olympics. These seasonal events could have an impact on subscribers in the suspension or churn group to become active subscribers and additional new subscribers may sign up for its services during these festivals or sporting events. Further, existing subscribers may move from a base pack to a sports pack or sports HD pack which would result in additional revenue for Videocon d2h during the relevant period. However, we assure you that the subscribers who sign up for Videocon d2h\u2019s services or upgrade their subscription packages during such events will continue to pay for their subscriptions or not revert to base subscription packages which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of Videocon d2h.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s Principal Shareholders shall continue to retain a majority of control in Videocon d2h after the Transaction, which shall allow them to exercise significant control over Videocon d2h.\nAfter the completion of the Transaction, Videocon d2h\u2019s Principal Shareholders will hold, directly or indirectly, between approximately 61.58% and 66.58% of Videocon d2h\u2019s outstanding equity shares. As a result, its Principal Shareholders will continue to exercise significant control over Videocon d2h, including being able to elect all of the members of its board of directors and thereby control its management and affairs. In addition, by exercising their control, Videocon d2h\u2019s Principal Shareholders could delay, defer or cause a change of Videocon d2h\u2019s control or a change in its capital structure, delay, defer or cause a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving Videocon d2h, or discourage or encourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Videocon d2h. Videocon d2h\u2019s Principal Shareholders may take or block actions with respect to its business, which may conflict with its interests or the interests of its minority shareholders. We cannot assure you that Videocon d2h\u2019s Principal Shareholders will always act in Videocon d2h\u2019s or your best interests.\nVideocon d2h does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Even if Videocon d2h decides to pay dividends in the future, Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to pay dividends will depend upon its future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditure and restrictive covenants in Videocon d2h\u2019s financing arrangements.\nVideocon d2h has not declared any dividends since its incorporation, has not adopted a formal dividend policy and does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of dividends by Videocon d2h, if any, will be recommended by its board of directors and approved by its shareholders at their discretion, subject to the provisions of Videocon d2h\u2019s Articles of Association and together, the notified provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (along with applicable rules framed thereunder) and the Companies Act, 1956, as amended (to the extent in force) (the \u201cIndian Companies Act\u201d). As a result, capital appreciation in the price of its ADSs, if any, may be your only source of gain on an investment in Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon a variety of factors, including its future earnings, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditure, restrictive covenants in its financing arrangements and other factors. As a result, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will declare or pay dividends of any particular amount, with any particular frequency or at all. In addition, under the Indian Companies Act and the rules framed thereunder, a company is permitted to declare or pay dividends in any year out of profits for that year after providing for depreciation, as prescribed. In the event of inadequacy or absence of profits in a particular year, dividends may be paid out of the accumulated profits of the company (after providing for depreciation) which remain undistributed and transferred to the free reserves, subject to certain conditions, including that carried over losses and depreciation not provided for in previous years are set off against the profit of the current year. Videocon d2h had a loss for fiscal year 2014 of Rs.3,195.48 million. There can be no assurance that Videocon d2h will have distributable funds in future periods nor can we assure you that Videocon d2h will be able to generate profit and eliminate its accumulated loss in the future so as to enable it to pay dividends under the Indian Companies Act.\nImplementation of the proposed employee plans will result in a charge to Videocon d2h\u2019s profit and loss account, which may adversely affect its results of operations.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s board of directors and shareholders have adopted, subject to the approval of the MIB, the Videocon d2h Employees Stock Option Scheme 2014 (the \u201cESOP 2014\u201d), effective from August 1, 2014. The ESOP 2014 will be administered by the Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committee of Videocon d2h\u2019s board of directors and implemented by the Videocon d2h Employees Welfare Trust. Upon receipt of the approval of the MIB, Videocon d2h expects to complete allotment of 4,000,000 equity shares to the Videocon d2h Employees Welfare Trust, in accordance with the ESOP 2014. Additionally, Videocon d2h shall adopt a stock option plan, in accordance with applicable law, granting Mr. Saurabh Dhoot stock options at closing which shall be exercisable, subject to the achievement of certain ADS price targets for a specified period following the closing, to receive 2,800,000 equity shares of Videocon d2h, equivalent to 700,000 Videocon d2h ADSs.\nUnder International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIFRS\u201d), the grant of stock options will result in a charge to Videocon d2h\u2019s profit and loss account and dilute the Earnings per Share which may adversely affect its results of operations.\nRisks Related to Videocon d2h\u2019s Operations in India\nA slowdown in economic growth in India may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of its equity shares and the trading price of the Videocon d2h ADSs.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s results of operations and financial condition are dependent on, and have been adversely affected by, conditions in financial markets in the global economy and, particularly, in India. The Indian economy could be adversely affected by various factors such as political or regulatory action, including adverse changes in liberalization policies, business corruption, social disturbances, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, natural calamities, interest rates, inflation, commodity and energy prices and various other factors. Any slowdown in the Indian economy may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, value of its equity shares and the trading price of the Videocon d2h ADSs.\nRegional hostilities, terrorist attacks, communal disturbances, civil unrest and other acts of violence or war involving India and other countries may result in a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and trading price of the ADSs.\nTerrorist attacks, civil unrest and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect the Indian markets in which Videocon d2h operates its business and also adversely affect the worldwide financial markets. In addition, Asia has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries. Hostilities and tensions may occur in the future and on a wider scale. Military activity or terrorist attacks in India, such as the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 and in July 2011, may result in investor concern about stability in the region, which may adversely affect the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and the trading price of the ADSs. Events of this nature in the future, as well as social and civil unrest within other countries in Asia, could influence the Indian economy and could have an adverse effect on the Videocon d2h\u2019s business, including the value of equity shares and the trading price of the ADSs.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires and pandemic disease may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The potential impact of a natural disaster on Videocon d2h\u2019s results of operations and financial position is speculative and would depend on numerous factors. The extent and severity of these natural disasters determines their effect on the Indian economy. Although the long term effect of diseases such as the H5N1 \u201cavian flu\u201d, or H1N1, the swine flu, cannot currently be predicted, previous occurrences of avian flu and swine flu had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. An outbreak of a communicable disease in India could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that natural disasters will not occur in the future or that Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected.\nAny downgrade of credit ratings of India or Indian companies may adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to raise debt financing.\nIndia\u2019s sovereign foreign currency long-term debt is currently rated (i) \u201cBBB-\u201d (negative) by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (\u201cStandard & Poor\u2019s\u201d), (ii) \u201cBBB-\u201d (negative) by Fitch Ratings Ltd (\u201cFitch\u201d), and (iii) \u201cBaa3\u201d (stable) by Moody\u2019s Investors Services Limited (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d). These ratings reflect an assessment of the GoI\u2019s overall financial capacity to pay its obligations and its ability or willingness to meet its financial commitments as they become due.\nNo assurance can be given that Standard & Poor\u2019s, Fitch, Moody\u2019s or any other statistical rating organization will not downgrade the credit ratings of India. Any downgrade could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with Videocon d2h\u2019s current variable rate debt and its ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms in the future. This could have an adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s financial condition.\nA decline in India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves may affect liquidity and interest rates in the Indian economy.\nAccording to a report released by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves totaled approximately US$320 billion as of December 19, 2014. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have declined recently and may have negatively affected the valuation of the Rupee. Further declines in foreign exchange reserves could adversely affect the valuation of the Rupee and could result in reduced liquidity and higher interest rates that could adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s future financial condition and the market price of the Videocon d2h ADSs.\nRisks Related to Videocon d2h ADSs to be issued in the Transaction\nSince a majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s directors, officers and assets reside or are located outside of the United States, investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against Videocon d2h, its directors and officers.\nVideocon d2h is incorporated under the laws of India. Further, Videocon d2h conducts substantially all of its operations in India. The majority of its directors and officers, and some of the experts named in our proxy statement/prospectus, reside outside the United States, and a majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s assets and some or all of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon Videocon d2h or those persons, or to recover against Videocon d2h or those persons on judgments of United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws. An award of punitive damages by a United States court based upon United States federal securities laws is likely to be construed by Indian courts to be penal in nature and therefore unenforceable in India. Further, no claim may be brought in India against Videocon d2h or its directors and officers in the first instance for a violation of United States federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial application under Indian law and are not enforceable in India. However, an Indian court may impose civil liability, including the possibility of monetary damages, on Videocon d2h or its directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Indian law. Moreover, it is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action were brought in India or that the Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with Indian practice or public policy.\nThe courts of India would not automatically enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against Videocon d2h or its directors and officers, or some of the experts named in our proxy statement/prospectus, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws, or entertain actions brought in India against Videocon d2h or such persons predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws. Further, the United States has not been declared by the Government of India to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of enforcement of foreign judgments, and there are grounds upon which Indian courts may decline to enforce the judgments of United States courts. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including remedies available under the United States federal securities laws, may not be allowed in Indian courts if contrary to public policy in India. Because judgments of United States courts are not automatically enforceable in India, it may be difficult for you to recover against Videocon d2h or its directors and officers or some experts named in our proxy statement/prospectus based upon such judgments. In India, prior approval of the RBI is required in order to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to such judgments.\nAs a foreign private issuer, Videocon d2h is permitted to, and Videocon d2h will, follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of certain NASDAQ requirements applicable to U.S. issuers. As a result, Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholders and ADS holders will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements, which may make its ADSs less attractive to investors or otherwise harm the ADS share price.\nAs a foreign private issuer whose ADSs will be listed on NASDAQ, Videocon d2h will be permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of certain NASDAQ requirements, although Videocon will be subject to certain independence requirements with respect to its audit committee under NASDAQ rules. NASDAQ listing rules require, inter alia, that (i) a majority of the board of directors of a listed company be comprised of independent directors; (ii) each listed company have an audit committee comprised of at least three members, each of whom must be an independent director; and (iii) each listed company have a compensation committee comprised of at least two members, each of whom must be an independent director.\nIn accordance with the Indian Companies Act a public company with paid up share capital of Rs.100 million or more; or turnover of Rs.1,000 million or more; or outstanding loans, debentures and deposits which in aggregate exceed Rs.500 million, is required to have at least two independent directors on its board of directors. Further, such company is required to constitute a Nomination and Remuneration Committee, comprising at least three non-executive directors, of whom a majority must be independent directors, who shall be responsible for determining qualifications and independence of directors and formulating a policy relating to the remuneration of directors and key managerial personnel. A foreign private issuer must disclose in its annual reports filed with the SEC each NASDAQ requirement it does not comply with, followed by a description of its applicable home country practice. As a company incorporated in India and listed on the NASDAQ, Videocon d2h expects to follow its home country practice with respect to the composition of Videocon d2h\u2019s board of directors and Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committees and executive sessions. Unlike the requirements of the NASDAQ, the corporate governance practice and requirements in India include, that a \u201cpublic company\u201d under the Indian Companies Act, which is not listed on any stock exchanges in India, is required to comply with the provisions of the Indian Companies Act, including the following provisions relating to corporate governance:\nComposition of Board of Directors: In accordance with Indian Companies Act, a public company with paid up share capital of Rs.100 million or more; or turnover of Rs.1,000 million or more; or outstanding loans, debentures and deposits which in aggregate exceeds Rs.500 million, is required to have at least two independent directors on its board of directors. The Indian Companies Act prescribes certain eligibility criteria for qualifying as an independent director.\nAdditionally, a public company with paid up share capital of Rs.1,000 million or more; or turnover of Rs.3,000 million or more is required to have at least one woman director on its board of directors with effect from April 1, 2015.\nBoard Committees: In accordance with the Indian Companies Act, a public company with paid up share capital of Rs.100 million or more; or turnover of Rs.1,000 million or more; or outstanding loans, debentures and deposits which in aggregate exceeds Rs.500 million, is required to constitute the following committees.\n\u00b7 Audit Committee - The audit committee, in accordance with Indian Companies Act, is required to be composed of at least three directors, with independent directors forming a majority; however, because Videocon d2h expects the ADSs to be listed on NASDAQ following the closing of the Transaction, it will be required to have an audit committee consisting entirely of independent directors, subject to certain limited exceptions. Majority of the members, including the chairman of the audit committee should have the ability to read and understand financial statements. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing a company\u2019s financial reporting process and disclosures of its financial information.\n\u00b7 Nomination and Remuneration Committee - The nomination and remuneration committee, responsible for determining qualifications and independence of directors and formulating a policy relating to the remuneration of directors and key managerial personnel, shall be composed of three or more non-executive directors, of which not less than one half should be independent directors.\nIn addition, should a company have net worth of Rs.5,000 million or more; or turnover of Rs.10,000 million or more; or net profit of Rs.50 million or more during any fiscal year, it will be required to constitute a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board composed of three or more directors, of which at least one director is required to be an independent director. Similarly, should a company have more than 1,000 security holders; it will be required to constitute a Stakeholders Relationship Committee for resolving the grievances of the security holders, composed of a chairman who is a non-executive director and such other members that the board of directors may decide.\nAccordingly, Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholders will not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, which could make its ADSs less attractive to some investors or could otherwise harm the market price of the ADSs.\nAn active trading market for Videocon d2h ADSs may not develop and the trading price for Videocon d2h ADSs may fluctuate significantly.\nPrior to the issuance of the Videocon d2h ADSs, there has been no public market for Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares or ADSs. If an active public market for Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs does not develop after the closing of the Transaction, the market price and liquidity of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADS may be adversely affected. Assuming Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs are approved for listing on NASDAQ, a liquid public market for Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs may not develop or be sustained after the closing of the Transaction. The offering price for Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs was determined by negotiation between Videocon d2h and us and the price at which the ADSs are traded after the closing of the Transaction may decline below the offering price, which means you may experience a decrease in the value of your ADSs regardless of Videocon d2h\u2019s operating performance or prospects. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class actions against that company. If Videocon d2h were involved in a class action suit, it could divert the attention of senior management, and, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the price of the ADSs is substantially higher than Videocon d2h\u2019s book value per equity share, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution.\nPurchasers of Videocon d2h ADSs will experience immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value per ADS from the Issue price per ADS. Assuming none of our stockholders exercise their redemption rights, after giving effect to the issue of ADSs at the assumed price of US$10.00 per ADS, Videocon d2h\u2019s net tangible book value as of September 30, 2014 would have been approximately US$151.90 million, or US$1.55 per ADS. This represents an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of US$8.45 per ADS to investors in the Transaction.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of Videocon d2h ADSs could adversely affect its market price.\nSales of substantial amounts of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs in the public market after the completion of the Transaction, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs and could materially impair Videocon d2h\u2019s future ability to raise capital through offerings of ADSs or other equity shares.\nAssuming none of our stockholders exercise their redemption rights, Videocon d2h will have 393 million equity shares outstanding immediately after the Transaction. Further, although certain of Videocon d2h shareholders are subject to restrictions on selling shares until the expiration of the lock-in period, all of the ADSs issued in the Transaction will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), unless held by Videocon d2h\u2019s \u201caffiliates\u201d or our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Subject to the one year or 365-day lock-up restrictions described below and other applicable restrictions and limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, all of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares outstanding prior to the Transaction will be eligible for sale in the public market. If these equity shares are converted to ADSs and sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and the ADSs could decline.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Videocon d2h and its significant shareholders have entered into a lock-up agreement pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to some exceptions, not to sell any equity shares or equity shares underlying ADSs for a period of one year after the date of our proxy statement/prospectus without the approval of Videocon d2h\u2019s Audit Committee. However, after the lock-up agreement expires, we cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of equity shares held by Videocon d2h\u2019s significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these equity shares for future sale will have on the market price of Videocon d2h ADSs. See the risk factor entitled \u201cA significant portion of Videocon d2h\u2019s shareholding is pledged as security to banks and financial institutions.\u201d\nFuture issuances of equity shares by Videocon d2h may dilute your holdings and decrease the market value of your ADSs.\nAny issuance of equity shares by Videocon d2h after the closing of the Transaction such as pursuant to Videocon\u2019s ESOP 2014, could dilute the interests of Videocon d2h shareholders and could substantially decrease the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and ADSs. Videocon d2h may issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance Videocon d2h\u2019s operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions and other transactions), to adjust Videocon d2h\u2019s ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy Videocon d2h\u2019s obligations upon the exercise of then-outstanding options or other equity-linked securities, if any, or for other reasons.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain Videocon d2h\u2019s resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, Videocon d2h will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and NASDAQ rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations will increase Videocon d2h\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on its systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that Videocon d2h file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Videocon d2h maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of Videocon d2h\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, it will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. Videocon d2h will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining Videocon d2h\u2019s growth also will require it to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join its organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVideocon d2h expects to incur significant additional annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. Videocon d2h also expects that the new rules and regulations to which it will be subject as a result of being a public company will make it more expensive for Videocon d2h to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and it may be required to accept reduced coverage for such directors and officers. Any of these factors could make it more difficult for Videocon d2h to attract and retain qualified members of its board of directors.\nVideocon d2h has no operating history as a publicly-traded company, and its inexperience could materially and adversely affect the company and its shareholders.\nVideocon d2h has no operating history as a publicly-traded company. Its board of directors and senior management team will have overall responsibility for the company\u2019s management and only a limited number of Videocon d2h\u2019s directors or members of its senior management team have prior experience in operating a public company. As a publicly-traded company, Videocon d2h will be required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy its periodic SEC reporting and NASDAQ obligations. We assure you that management\u2019s past experience will be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate the company. Failure to do so could jeopardize Videocon d2h\u2019s compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to publicly-traded companies, which could materially and adversely affect the company, its shareholders and the market price for the company\u2019s securities.\nIf Videocon d2h fails to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that Videocon d2h has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that it can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. Videocon d2h would be required to perform the annual review and evaluation of our internal controls no later than for the fiscal year ending 2020. Videocon d2h initially expects to qualify as an emerging growth company, and thus, would be exempt from the auditors\u2019 attestation requirement until such time as Videocon d2h no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company. Videocon d2h will need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable NASDAQ requirements, among other items. Establishing these internal controls will be costly and may divert the management\u2019s attention.\nEvaluation by Videocon d2h of its internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause it to be unable to report its financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject it to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NASDAQ listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in Videocon d2h and the reliability of its financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of Videocon d2h\u2019s financial statements also could suffer if it or its independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect Videocon d2h\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of its ADSs.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Videocon d2h\u2019s business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding its ADSs, the ADS stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about Videocon d2h or its business. If any of the analysts who cover Videocon d2h downgrades its ADSs or publishes inaccurate or unfavourable research about its business, its ADS price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of Videocon d2h or fail to regularly publish reports on Videocon d2h, Videocon d2h could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of its ADSs or trading volume to decline and its ADSs to be less liquid.\nVideocon d2h\u2019s ADS price may be volatile and may decline substantially from the offering price.\nEven if a trading market develops after the Transaction, the market price of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of its ADSs in spite of its operating performance. In addition, Videocon d2h\u2019s operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in its quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to holders of its ADSs, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about its industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting its business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness Videocon d2h may incur or securities it may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industry Videocon d2h operates in or individual scandals, and in response to these events the market price of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs could decrease significantly.\nVideocon d2h may be classified as a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse United States federal income tax consequences to US Holders.\nBased on the market prices of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs and the composition of Videocon d2h\u2019s income and assets, including goodwill, although not clear, Videocon d2h does not believe it was a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes for its taxable year ended March 31, 2014. However, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects and, therefore, the US Internal Revenue Service may assert that, contrary to its belief, it was a PFIC for such taxable year. Moreover, although the asset test (defined below) is required to be calculated based on the fair market value of its assets, it did not do a valuation of its assets and its belief that it was not a PFIC for its taxable year ended March 31, 2014 is, in part, based on the book value of its assets. A non-United States corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the total value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets, including cash, that produce or are held for the production of passive income, or passive assets. In addition, a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether Videocon d2h was a PFIC for that year. Because the aggregate value of its assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of its ADSs, fluctuations in the market price of the ADSs may cause Videocon d2h to become a PFIC. In addition, changes in the composition of its income or assets may cause it to become a PFIC. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that Videocon d2h will not be a PFIC for the taxable year that will end on March 31, 2015 or any future taxable year. If it was a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds an ADS or an equity share, certain adverse United States federal income tax consequences could apply to the U.S. holder. A U.S. holder of shares in a PFIC may mitigate such adverse tax consequences under the PFIC rules by making a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election to include in income its share of the corporation's income on a current basis. However, if Videocon d2h is a PFIC, you may make a qualified electing fund election with respect to Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs or equity shares only if Videocon d2h agrees to furnish you annually with certain tax information, and it currently does not intend to prepare or provide such information.\nHolders of the ADSs might not have the same voting rights as the holders of Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares and might not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise their right to vote.\nExcept as described in our proxy statement/prospectus and in the deposit agreement, holders of the ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights attaching to the equity shares evidenced by the ADSs on an individual basis. Under the deposit agreement, holders of ADSs must vote by giving voting instructions to the depositary, including instructions to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by Videocon d2h. Upon receipt of such holder\u2019s voting instructions, the depositary will vote the underlying equity shares in accordance with these instructions. Holders of ADSs will not be able to directly exercise their right to vote with respect to the underlying equity shares unless they withdraw the equity shares. Holders of ADSs may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that holders of ADSs, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote.\nThe voting rights of holders of ADSs are limited by the terms of the deposit agreement.\nA holder of the ADSs may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying equity shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Upon receipt of voting instructions of a holder of ADSs in the manner set forth in the deposit agreement, the depositary will endeavor to vote the underlying equity shares in accordance with these instructions. When a general meeting is convened, holders of ADSs may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders\u2019 meeting to permit them to withdraw their equity shares to allow them to cast their votes with respect to any specific matter. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to holders of ADSs or carry out their voting instructions in a timely manner. Videocon d2h will make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to holders of ADSs in a timely manner, but we cannot assure such holders that they will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. Furthermore, the depositary will not vote on any matter for which voting is conducted on a show of hands basis in accordance with Videocon d2h\u2019s Articles of Association and will not have an obligation to demand voting on a poll basis. The depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast, or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote and may lack recourse if their equity shares are not voted as requested.\nA holder of ADSs right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to such holder\u2019s holdings.\nVideocon d2h may, from time to time, distribute rights to its shareholders, including rights to acquire Videocon d2h securities. However, Videocon d2h cannot make rights available to holders of ADSs in the United States unless Videocon d2h registers the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. In addition, the deposit agreement provides that the depositary will not make rights available to holders of ADSs unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act or exempted from registration under the Securities Act. Videocon d2h is under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, Videocon d2h may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, ADS holders may be unable to participate in Videocon d2h\u2019s rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings. In addition, if the depositary is unable to sell rights that are not exercised or not distributed, or if the sale is not lawful or reasonably practicable, it will allow the rights to lapse, in which case holders of ADSs will receive no value for these rights.\nHolders of ADSs may be subject to limitations on transfer of their ADSs.\nADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems necessary in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books from time to time for a number of reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs to maintain an exact number of ADS holders on its books for a specified period. The depositary may also close its books in emergencies, and on weekends and public holidays. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when Videocon d2h\u2019s books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if Videocon d2h or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement.\nHolders of ADSs might not receive distributions on Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares, or any value for them at all, if it is unlawful or impracticable for Videocon d2h to make them available to such holders.\nThe depositary of the ADSs has agreed to pay holders of ADSs the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian for the ADSs receives on Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses in accordance with the deposit agreement. Holders of ADSs will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Videocon d2h equity shares that their ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it is unlawful or impracticable to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but such securities are not properly registered or distributed pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration. The depositary is not responsible for making a distribution available to any holders of ADSs if any government approval or registration is required for such distribution. Videocon d2h has no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of the ADSs, equity shares, rights or anything else to holders of the ADSs. This means that holders of ADSs might not receive the distributions that Videocon d2h makes on its equity shares or any value for them at all if it is unlawful or impracticable for Videocon d2h to make them available to you.\nRisks Related to the Company and the Transaction\nOur Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz either directly or beneficially own shares of our common stock and warrants and have obligations and interests in the Transaction that are different from, or in addition to, our public stockholders. If the Transaction is not approved, the securities held by our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz will likely become worthless.\nOur Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, as well as any additional shares purchased during or after our initial public offering, in favor of the Transaction. Accordingly, it is more likely that the requisite stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz had agreed to vote their Founder Shares in accordance with the majority of votes cast by our public stockholders. Our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 19.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.\nIn light of the amount of consideration paid, our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz will likely significantly benefit from the consummation of the Transaction, even if the Transaction causes the market price of our securities to significantly decline. Furthermore, the $7.5 million purchase price of the 15,000,000 Private Placement Warrants will be included in the working capital that is distributed to our public stockholders in the event of our dissolution and liquidation if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by July 30, 2015. These factors may influence our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz in promoting the Transaction and/or soliciting proxies for the approval of the Transaction and approval of the Warrant Amendment. The common stock and warrants held by our Initial Stockholders had an aggregate market value (without taking into account any discount that may be attributed to such securities due to their restricted nature or any exercise limitations of the Private Placement Warrants) of $86.375 million based on the closing sale prices of $9.80 and $0.45, respectively, on OTCQB on December 30, 2014. The Founder Shares are subject to lock-up agreements, and our Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz have waived any rights to receive any liquidation proceeds that may be distributed upon our liquidation in respect of the Founder Shares. Therefore, if the Transaction is not approved by our stockholders, and we are subsequently required to commence proceedings to dissolve and liquidate, the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants held directly or beneficially by the Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz will be worthless.\nIn addition, in considering the recommendation of our board of directors in the proxy statement/prospectus to vote in favor of the Transaction and the Warrant Amendment, you should also be aware that (i) it is currently anticipated that Harry E. Sloan and Jeff Sagansky, each of whom is a current member of our board of directors, will each be appointed as a director of Videocon d2h following the Transaction and will be compensated for such service in the same manner as the other directors of Videocon d2h, and (ii) if the Transaction is not approved and we have not completed an alternative business combination by July 30, 2015, the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants held by the Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz will be worthless because they are not entitled to receive any of the funds held in the Trust Account that may be distributed upon our liquidation.\nIn addition, if we dissolve and liquidate prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, Harry E. Sloan and Jeff Sagansky, pursuant to certain written agreements executed in connection with our initial public offering, will be personally liable for any successful claims made by third parties for services rendered or products sold to us and by potential target businesses who entered into written agreements, such as a letter of intent or confidentiality agreement, with us and who did not waive all of their rights to make claims against the proceeds in the Trust Account, to the extent such claims reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, in each case less franchise and income taxes payable.\nOur directors will not receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them on our behalf incident to identifying, investigating and consummating a business combination to the extent such expenses exceed the amount not required to be retained in the Trust Account, unless a business combination is consummated.\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors may have influenced their decision as members of our board of directors to approve and adopt the Contribution Agreement and the Warrant Agreement Amendment. In considering the recommendations of our board of directors to vote in favor of the Transaction and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, you should consider these interests. Additionally, the exercise of the directors\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the Contribution Agreement prior to the vote by the stockholders or warrantholders, as applicable, may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes or waivers are appropriate and in the stockholders\u2019 or warrantholders\u2019, as applicable, best interest.\nIn connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Transaction, the Sponsor, our directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase Public Shares from our public stockholders, which may influence the vote to approve the Transaction or public warrants from warrantholders, which may influence the vote to approve the Warrant Agreement Amendment.\nIn connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Transaction, the Sponsor, our directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of the Transaction, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a share purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that the Sponsor, our directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from holders of Public Shares other than the Initial Stockholders, Jay Itzkowitz and Eli Baker (the \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d) who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such public stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the Transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Transaction or to satisfy the closing condition in the Contribution Agreement that requires the Contribution Amount to be at least $200,850,000, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of the Transaction that may not otherwise have been possible. Similarly, the purchase of warrants could increase the likelihood that the Warrant Agreement Amendment is approved in circumstances in which such approval could not be otherwise obtained.\nIf a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer of redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Transaction, such shares may not be redeemed.\nWe will comply with the proxy rules when conducting redemptions in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Transaction. Despite compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive the proxy materials, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem his, her or its Public Shares. In addition, the proxy materials that we are furnishing to holders of our shares in connection with the Transaction describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem the shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, such stockholder\u2019s shares may not be redeemed.\nOur securityholders will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate their investment, therefore, our securityholders may be forced to sell their shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in the proxy statement/prospectus, and (ii) the redemption of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by April 30, 2015 (or July 30, 2015, as applicable), subject to applicable law and as further described in the proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, if we plan to redeem our shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by April 30, 2015 (or July 30, 2015, as applicable), compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a proposal to dissolve to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in the Trust Account. In that case, our public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond April 30, 2015 (or July 30, 2015, as applicable) before they receive funds from the Trust Account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the Trust Account. Accordingly, to liquidate their investment, our securityholders may be forced to sell their shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nNASDAQ recently delisted our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur units, common stock and warrants were delisted from NASDAQ as of December 8, 2014 as a result of our failure to demonstrate compliance with the NASDAQ listing requirement that listed companies have at least 300 public holders. The delisting of our securities could have significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in such common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nBecause the market price of Videocon d2h ADSs will fluctuate and because there is currently no trading market for the Videocon d2h equity shares and corresponding ADSs, our stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the consideration they will receive when the Transaction is completed, and the value may be less than what respective shareholders originally paid for their shares of our common stock.\nIf the Transaction is completed, Videocon d2h will receive the Contribution Amount from us in exchange for the issuance of equity shares of Videocon d2h, represented by ADSs. Each holder of one share of our common stock for which the holder did not validly exercise redemption rights will receive one ADS in the Transaction, subject to adjustment in accordance with the Contribution Agreement. The value of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs may vary significantly from the closing price of our equity shares on the date the Transaction was announced, on the date the parties entered into the Contribution Agreement, on the date that the proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to our stockholders and warrantholders or on the date of the special meetings of our stockholders and warrantholders to approve the Transaction and the Warrant Agreement Amendment, or thereafter. No trading market for Videocon d2h\u2019s equity shares or the ADSs representing the equity shares currently exists and, therefore, our securityholders cannot be sure of the price at which the ADSs will trade if the Transaction is completed.\nTherefore, the value of the Videocon d2h ADSs that our stockholders receive in the Transaction, either upon or after the completion of the Transaction, may be lower than what our securityholders originally paid for their corresponding securities prior to the Transaction.\nThe ability of our stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that the Transaction would be unsuccessful and that our stockholders would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem their stock.\nSince the Contribution Agreement requires the Contribution Amount to be at least $200,850,000, the probability that the Transaction with Videocon d2h will be unsuccessful is increased if a large number of our Public Shares are tendered for redemption. If the Transaction is unsuccessful, our public stockholders will not receive their pro rata portion of the Trust Account until the Trust Account is liquidated. If our public stockholders are in need of immediate liquidity, they could attempt to sell their stock in the open market; however, at such time, our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata per share amount in the Trust Account. In either situation, our stockholders may suffer a material loss on their investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with the redemption until the Company is liquidated or our stockholders are able to sell their stock in the open market.\nIf one of our stockholders chooses to redeem his, her or its shares, he, she or it may not exercise his, her or its redemption rights to cause the redemption of his, her or its shares of our common stock for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account, including any interest earned thereon, less franchise and income taxes payable, until the date that is two business days prior to the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to vote on the Transaction.\nStockholders holding shares of our common stock issued in our initial public offering, whether or not they vote against the Transaction, may elect to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of the Transaction for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account which holds the proceeds of our initial public offering as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Transaction, including interest, less franchise and income taxes payable, upon the closing of the Transaction. Any stockholder who seeks to exercise this redemption right must, with respect to the portion of shares he, she or it wishes to redeem, prior to 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on March 26, 2015 (two business days before the special meeting), (i) submit a written request to our transfer agent that we redeem such Public Shares for cash, and (ii) deliver their stock to our transfer agent physically or electronically through the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d). The address of Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent, is 17 Battery Place, New York, New York 10004, Attn: Mark Zimkind.\nIf an individual stockholder or a \u201cgroup\u201d of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 10% of our common stock, that individual or group will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 10% of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 10% of the Public Shares (the \u201cExcess Shares\u201d). However, stockholders are not restricted from voting all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against the Transaction. The inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce the influence of our stockholders over our ability to complete the Transaction, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss on their investment in us if they sell their Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete the Transaction. As a result, such stockholders would continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 10% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\nWe expect to incur significant costs associated with the Transaction, whether or not the Transaction is completed, and if we incur costs in excess of a specified amount, Videocon d2h may not be obligated to consummate the Transaction.\nWhether or not the Transaction is completed, we expect to incur significant costs associated with the Transaction, including due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting the Transaction. If the parties do not consummate the Transaction, and if time permits us to seek an alternative business combination, then the costs we will have incurred with respect to the proposed business combination with Videocon d2h will reduce the amount of cash otherwise available to complete an alternative business combination. We estimate that we will incur significant transaction costs associated with the Transaction of at least approximately $50.4 million. In addition, if the combination of deferred underwriting fees and commissions, our transaction expenses and payments to warrantholders exceed approximately $50.4 million, together with redemptions of Public Shares in excess of 7,387,387 shares, then we may not be able to meet the closing condition contained in the Contribution Agreement that the Contribution Amount is at least $200,850,000, and Videocon d2h will not be obligated to consummate the Transaction.\nVideocon d2h is required to obtain certain approvals of the MIB in respect of the Transaction and related matters. If it fails to do so, the Transaction cannot take place.\nUnder the terms of the DTH Guidelines and the DTH License Agreement, Videocon d2h is required to obtain the prior written permission of the MIB for effecting any change in its equity structure and security clearance from the MIB in respect of each of Messrs. Sloan and Sagansky (and the alternate directors for each, if any).\nIn the event that the MIB does not grant such approval, Videocon d2h will be unable to consummate the Transaction. Further, we are unable to guarantee that Videocon d2h will obtain approvals required from the MIB in the future in a timely manner, or at all, or that it will be able to comply with any further conditions imposed by the MIB while granting such permissions.\nThere are significant limitations on our right to make damage claims against Videocon d2h for the breach of any representations, warranties or covenants made by Videocon d2h in the Contribution Agreement.\nThe Contribution Agreement provides that Videocon d2h will indemnify us and our affiliated indemnitees under the Contribution Agreement from and against the entirety of any damages suffered as a result of any breach by Videocon d2h of a representation, warranty or post-closing covenant of Videocon d2h. However, there are significant limitations on our right to indemnification under the Contribution Agreement, including:\n\u00b7 We will not be entitled to indemnification with respect to the inaccuracy or non-compliance of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Videocon d2h in the Contribution Agreement or any other certificate or document delivered pursuant to the Contribution Agreement if Videocon d2h proves that we obtained actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or non-compliance from Videocon d2h prior to entering into the Contribution Agreement.\n\u00b7 Videocon d2h will have no liability with respect to any claim for breach of a representation or warranty of Videocon d2h unless we notify Videocon d2h of such a claim on or before the date that is 30 days after the earlier of the date on which Videocon d2h has made publicly available (by inclusion in a Form 6-K filed with the SEC) its audited financial statements (which are audited by a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board registered firm and are prepared under IFRS) for (i) the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 or (ii) the six-month period ended September 30, 2015, if either Harry E. Sloan or Jeff Sagansky or an alternate director or nominee director appointed on their behalf by them, served on the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Videocon d2h which approved such financial statements and such financial statements include all of the information and notes required for annual financial statements under IFRS.\n\u00b7 Other than with respect to damages relating to any intentional or fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty by Videocon d2h, Videocon d2h will have no liability with respect to any claim for breach of a representation or warranty of Videocon d2h until we and our affiliated indemnitees have suffered aggregate damages by reason of all such breaches in excess of an amount equal to 2.0% of the Contribution Amount (the \u201cBasket\u201d), after which point Videocon d2h will be obligated to indemnify us and our affiliated indemnitees from and against damages which exceed the Basket.\n\u00b7 Other than with respect to damages relating to any intentional or fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty by Videocon d2h, the aggregate maximum liability of Videocon d2h with respect to any claim for breach of a representation or warranty of Videocon d2h will be an amount equal to 12.5% of the Contribution Amount.\n\u00b7 Videocon d2h will not be liable to indemnify us or any of our affiliated indemnitees from or against any damages arising out of, relating to, or caused by the realization of any contingent liabilities expressly disclosed as such in the audited balance sheets, statements of income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows of Videocon d2h as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014 or the legal proceedings set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus.\nAs a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the rules and regulations of the SEC, Videocon d2h is exempt from a number of rules under the Exchange Act and may be permitted to file less or different information with the SEC than a company incorporated in the United States or otherwise subject to these rules.\nVideocon d2h is considered a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the Exchange Act and is therefore exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules, which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations for U.S. and other issuers. Moreover, Videocon d2h is not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or within the same time frames as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. Videocon d2h currently prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Videocon d2h will not be required to file financial statements prepared in accordance with or reconciled to U.S. GAAP so long as its financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which do not differ from IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Videocon d2h is not required to comply with Regulation FD, which imposes restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information to shareholders. In addition, Videocon d2h\u2019s officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of Videocon d2h shares. Accordingly, after the Transaction, if you continue to hold Videocon d2h ADSs, you may receive less or different information about Videocon d2h than you currently receive about us.\nVideocon d2h could lose its status as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of Videocon d2h\u2019s outstanding voting securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and one of the following is true: (i) the majority of Videocon d2h\u2019s directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of Videocon d2h\u2019s assets are located in the United States; or (iii) Videocon d2h\u2019s business is administered principally in the United States. If Videocon d2h loses its status as a foreign private issuer in the future, it will no longer be exempt from the rules described above and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and annual and quarterly financial statements as if it were a company incorporated in the United States. If this were to happen, Videocon d2h would likely incur substantial costs in fulfilling these additional regulatory requirements and members of Videocon d2h\u2019s management would likely have to divert time and resources from other responsibilities to ensuring these additional regulatory requirements are fulfilled.\nVideocon d2h has not previously operated as a foreign private issuer in the United States, and fulfilling its obligations as a foreign private issuer after the Transaction may be expensive and time consuming.\nVideocon d2h has not previously been required to prepare or file periodic and other reports with the SEC or to comply with the other requirements of U.S. federal securities laws applicable to public companies, such as Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although Videocon d2h currently maintains separate legal and compliance and internal audit functions, Videocon d2h has not previously been required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as will be required with respect to a public company with substantial operations and shares registered in the United States.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as the rules of NASDAQ, where Videocon d2h intends to apply for listing of the Videocon d2h ADSs, Videocon d2h may be required to implement additional corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and accounting rules. However, as a \u201cforeign private issuer,\u201d Videocon d2h may be exempt from some corporate governance practices, reporting requirements and accounting rules under the rules of NASDAQ and under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. For example, Videocon d2h is permitted to follow its home country corporate governance practices in lieu of NASDAQ rules with some exceptions so long as it discloses the ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by U.S. issuers under NASDAQ listing standards. As an additional example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 gives foreign private issuers certain exemptions from the requirement that each member of the foreign private issuer\u2019s audit committee be \u201cindependent.\u201d\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an audit committee member generally may not receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation from the issuer except for service as a director, and may not be an affiliate of the issuer. For foreign private issuers, an exemption is available from those requirements for an employee of the issuer, other than an executive officer, who is elected or named to the audit committee pursuant to the issuer\u2019s governing law or documents, an employee collective bargaining or similar agreement or other home country legal or listing requirements. Exemptions from the limitation on affiliates are available for a member of the audit committee who is a representative or designee of a foreign government or foreign governmental entity that is an affiliate of the issuer, provided the member is not an executive officer of the issuer, and a member who is an affiliate of the issuer or a representative of an affiliate who has only observer status on, and is not a voting member or the chair of, the audit committee; provided neither the member nor the affiliate is an executive officer of the issuer. Videocon d2h is not, however, relying on any exemption from the independence standards for any of its audit committee members.\nCompliance with obligations from which foreign private issuers are not exempt may require members of Videocon d2h\u2019s management and its finance and accounting staff to divert time and resources from other responsibilities to ensuring these additional regulatory requirements are fulfilled and may increase Videocon d2h\u2019s legal, insurance and financial compliance costs.\nThere is no guarantee that, once listed, the ADSs will continue to qualify for listing on the exchange for any period of time, and the failure to have the ADSs listed for either reason may negatively affect the value of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs.\nVideocon d2h intends to seek to have its ADSs approved for listing on NASDAQ prior to consummation of the Transaction so that as soon as practicable following the closing of the Transaction, the ADSs can begin trading, and it is a mutual condition to closing of the Transaction that the ADSs be admitted to trading only subject to official notice of the issuance of the ADSs. There are no guarantees that, once listed, the Videocon d2h ADSs will continue to qualify for listing on the exchange, and the Videocon d2h ADSs may become subject to trading and other restrictions imposed by the exchange for failure to meet certain listing standards or the ADSs may be delisted by the exchange. If the Videocon d2h ADSs are ever in the future delisted, the holders could face significant consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability for market quotations for Videocon d2h\u2019s securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity with respect to Videocon d2h\u2019s securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs;\n\u00b7 limited amount of news and analyst coverage for Videocon d2h in the United States; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nShareholders may decide to sell our common stock and Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs, which could cause a decline in their market prices.\nSome holders of our common stock may be disinclined to own shares of a company that is not a U.S. company. This or other factors could result in the sale of shares of our common stock prior to the parties consummating the Transaction (in addition to exercises by our stockholders of their redemption rights) or the sale of Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs after completion of the Transaction. In addition, the market price of our common stock and Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs may be adversely affected by arbitrage activities occurring prior to completion of the Transaction. These sales, or the prospects of such sales in the future, could adversely affect the market price for, and the ability to sell in the market, shares of our common stock before the Transaction is completed, and Videocon d2h\u2019s ADSs after the completion of the Transaction.\nVideocon d2h may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThe success of the Transaction will depend, in part, on Videocon d2h\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the availability of the cash currently in the Trust Account to Videocon d2h following the completion of the Transaction. To realize these anticipated benefits, Videocon d2h must successfully manage and apply such cash.\nSubsequent to the completion of the Transaction, Videocon d2h may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on Videocon d2h, this diligence may not expose all material issues that may be present inside Videocon d2h, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Videocon d2h\u2019s and our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, Videocon d2h may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Even if due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on Videocon d2h\u2019s liquidity, the fact that charges of this nature are reported could contribute to negative market perceptions about Videocon d2h or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause Videocon d2h to violate net worth or other covenants to which it may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of its obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the Transaction could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the Transaction contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nPublic stockholders or warrantholders at the time of the Transaction who purchased their units in our initial public offering and do not exercise their redemption rights may pursue rescission rights and related claims.\nOur public stockholders or warrantholders may allege that some aspects of the Transaction are inconsistent with the disclosure contained in the prospectus issued by us in connection with the offer and sale in our initial public offering of units consisting of common stock and warrants. These may include: (i) the structure of the proposed business combination with Videocon d2h (including that we are not acquiring voting securities of Videocon d2h) and (ii) that our warrant agreement would be amended so that the warrants will be exchanged for cash in the amount of $1.00 at the time the Transaction is consummated. Consequently, a stockholder or warrantholder who purchased units in our initial public offering (excluding the Initial Stockholders, Eli Baker and Jay Itzkowitz) and still holds them at the time of the Transaction and who does not seek to exercise redemption rights might seek rescission of the purchase of the units such holder acquired in the initial public offering. A successful claimant for damages under federal or state law could be awarded an amount to compensate for the decrease in the value of such holder\u2019s shares caused by the alleged violation (including, possibly, punitive damages), together with interest, while retaining the shares. If stockholders or warrantholders bring successful rescission claims against us, we may not have sufficient funds following the consummation of the Transaction to pay such claims, or if claims are successfully brought against Videocon d2h following the consummation of the Transaction, Videocon d2h\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected and, in any event, Videocon d2h may be required in connection with the defense of such claims to incur expenses and divert employee attention from other business matters.\nIf Videocon d2h or third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $9.99 per share.\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although Videocon d2h has agreed and we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business agree to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or, even if they execute such agreements, may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if our management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any other alternative.\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where our management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims that they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our shares, if we are unable to complete the Transaction or another business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with the Transaction or another business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $9.99 per share currently held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Messrs. Sloan and Sagansky have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, in each case less franchise and income taxes payable, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Messrs. Sloan and Sagansky will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked Messrs. Sloan and Sagansky to reserve for such indemnification obligations, and we cannot assure you that Messrs. Sloan and Sagansky would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of the board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after the proceeds in the Trust Account are distributed to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by our stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to its public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with its liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.", "PERMNO": 14153, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "EAGL.2"}
