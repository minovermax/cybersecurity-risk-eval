{"cik": "87050", "company": "Neonode Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below in addition to the cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing products and our entry into the hardware market may not be successful.\nOur business model has focused on licensing touch technology. In recent years, we began to manufacture and sell sensor touch components. There is no assurance that our hardware manufacturing and sales will result in market acceptance or meaningful revenues. The success of our sensor modules will depend on customer response and our management execution. The success of our sensor modules is subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf the quality and reliability of product components that we source from third-party suppliers;\n\u25cf our ability to secure product components in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf our ability to increase production capacity or volumes to meet demand;\n\u25cf our ability to identify and qualify alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain effective sales channels.\nIn addition, if demand for our products increases, we will have to invest additional resources to purchase components, hire and train employees and enhance our manufacturing processes. If we fail to increase our production capacity efficiently, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers.\nOur license revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were earned from seventeen OEM, ODM and Tier 1 customers. We earned NRE from four customers for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three customers represented approximately 61% of our consolidated net revenues. Our customer concentration may change significantly from period-to-period depending on a customer\u2019s product cycle and changes in our industry. In addition, our customer composition may change as we transition to selling sensor modules in parallel to our licensing business. The response of customers to our sensor products, loss of a major customer, a reduction in net revenues of a major customer for any reason, or a failure of a major customer to fulfill its financial or other obligations due to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and future revenue stream.\nWe are dependent on the ability of our customers to design, manufacture and sell their products that incorporate our touch technology.\nWe historically generated revenue through technology licensing agreements with companies that must design, manufacture and sell their products incorporating our touch technology. The majority of our license fees earned in 2018 and 2017 were from customer shipments of printer products. Although we have broadened our business model to selling sensors in addition to licensing our technology, we expect to continue to receive licensing revenue from current and new customers who have products in their development cycle. If our customers are not able to design, manufacture or sell their products, or are delayed in producing their products, our revenues, profitability, and liquidity, as well as our brand image, may be adversely affected.\nThe length of a customer\u2019s product development and release cycle depends on many factors outside of our control and could cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues, or revenues that vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe development and release cycle for customer products is lengthy and unpredictable. Our customers often undertake significant evaluation and design in the qualification of our products, which contributes to a lengthy product release cycle. The typical product development and release cycle is eighteen to sixty months. The development and release cycle may be longer in some cases, particularly for automotive vehicle products. There is no assurance that a customer will adopt our technology after the evaluation or design phase. The lengthy and variable development and release cycle for products may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe and our license customers rely upon component suppliers to sell products containing our technology.\nUnder our licensing model, OEMs, ODMs and Tier 1 suppliers manufacture or contract to manufacture controller chips containing our touch technology. As an alternative to sourcing controller chips on their own, our customers may opt to use customized optical controller chips designed specifically for our technology. As part of their product development process, our customers must qualify the chip components used in our products. Under our sensor model, we use controller chips supplied by ST Microelectronics or Texas Instruments in our module products. If the controller chips provided by Texas Instruments, ST Microelectronics or another supplier experience quality control problems, our technology may be disqualified by one or more of our customers and our supply chain may be disrupted. The dependence on third parties to supply controller chips with our touch technology exposes us to a number of risks including their inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, the failure to meet our customer requirements, or their failure to remain in business or adjust to market conditions. If we and our customers are unable to obtain controller chips with our touch technology, we may not be able to meet demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.\nOur license agreements typically require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be effective.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new touch technology successfully, and in a cost-effective and timely manner, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, rapidly evolving environment, and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new touch technology that our customers and end users choose to buy. If we are unsuccessful at developing new touch technologies that are appealing to our customers and end users, with acceptable functionality, quality, prices and terms, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. The development of new touch technology is very difficult and requires high levels of innovation and competence. The development process is also lengthy and costly. If we fail to anticipate our end users\u2019 needs or technological trends accurately or if we are unable to complete development in a cost effective and timely fashion, we will be unable to introduce new touch technology into the market or successfully compete with other providers. As we introduce new or enhanced touch technology or integrate new touch technology into new or existing customer products, we face risks including, among other things, disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, inability to deliver new touch technology to meet customers\u2019 demand, possible product and technology defects, and potentially unfamiliar sales and support environments. Premature announcements or leaks of new products, features, or technologies may exacerbate some of these risks. Our failure to manage the transition to newer touch technology or the integration of newer technology into new or existing customer products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result of the unpredictability in our customer product development and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is extremely difficult for us to forecast accurately. We base our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect and cause fluctuations in our operating results:\n\u25cf the announcement or introduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to upgrade and develop our infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf technical difficulties;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the touchscreen industry.\nFurther, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.\nWe have had a history of losses and may require additional capital to fund our operations, which may not be available on commercially attractive terms or at all.\nWe have experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period since our inception. These net losses resulted from a lack of substantial revenues and the significant costs incurred in the development and acceptance of our technology. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan. If our operations do not become cash flow positive, we may be forced to seek sources of capital to continue operations. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plan, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe must enhance our sales and technology development organizations.\nWe continually monitor and enhance the effectiveness and breadth of our sales efforts in order to increase market awareness and sales of our technology, especially as we expand into new market areas. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense, and we may not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting. Likewise, our efforts to improve and refine our technology require skilled engineers and programmers. Competition for professionals capable of expanding our research and development efforts is intense due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills. If we are unable to identify, hire, or retain qualified sales, marketing, and technical personnel, our ability to achieve future revenue may be adversely affected.\nWe may make acquisitions and strategic investments that are dilutive to existing shareholders, resulting in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may decide to grow our business through business combinations or other acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing touch technology offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or we may incur substantial debt, reduce our cash reserves and/or assume contingent liabilities. Further, acquisitions and strategic investments may result in material charges, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, and the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill. Any of these could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of our key personnel.\nOur senior management team consists of two executive officers. In April 2018, H\u00e5kan Persson became our new Chief Executive Officer. In February 2019, Lars Lindqvist notified our Board of Directors of his intention to resign from his position as Chief Financial Officer. To assist in the transition, Mr. Lindqvist intends to continue serving as Chief Financial Officer until mid-2019 and a search to identify a qualified candidate to fill his position permanently has been initiated. Changes in our management and the unplanned loss of the services of any member of management could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future prospects.\nOur revenues and growth are dependent on licensing fees from our intellectual property.\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our intellectual property, particularly our patents, may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations. Our pending patent applications for registration may not be allowed, or others may challenge the validity or scope of our patents. Even if our patents registrations are issued and maintained, these patents may not be of adequate scope or benefit to us or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties. We may need to expend significant resources to secure and protect our intellectual property. The loss of intellectual property rights may adversely impact our ability to generate revenues and expand our business.\nWe may not be successful in our strategic efforts around patent monetization.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to effectively utilize our intellectual property. From time to time, we explore opportunities to monetize our patents. If in the future we enter into alternative patent monetization strategies, including the sale of patents, our financial condition, revenue and results of operations could be impacted. No assurance can be given that we will enter into agreements related to our patent portfolio or that we will be successful in any strategic efforts around patent monetization.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property, we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nExisting laws, contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection for our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Effective policing of the unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is not only expensive, but time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert attention of our management from operating the business. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to, among other things, the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting our intellectual property rights. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before they do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use. The unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our technology.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property.\nAs part of our business strategy, we target customers and relationships with suppliers and original equipment manufacturers in countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies. However, many of these countries do not address misappropriation of intellectual property nor deter others from developing similar, competing technologies or intellectual property. Effective protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. In particular, the laws of some foreign countries in which we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.\nWe have an international presence in countries and must manage currency risks.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported), primarily the Swedish Krona and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Taiwan Dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues from North America, Asia, and Europe were 50%, 40%, and 10% respectively. We incur a significant portion of our expenses in Swedish Krona, including a significant portion of our research and development expenses and a substantial portion of our general and administrative expenses. As a result, appreciation of the value of the Swedish Krona relative to the other currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, could adversely affect operating results. We do not currently undertake hedging transactions to cover our currency exposure, but we may choose to hedge a portion of our currency exposure in the future as it deems appropriate.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation.\nIn the normal course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThird parties that maintain our confidential and proprietary information could experience a cybersecurity incident.\nWe rely on third parties to provide or maintain some of our information technology and related services. We do not exercise direct control over these systems. Despite the implementation of security measures at third party locations, these services are also vulnerable to security breaches or other disruptions. Despite assurances from third parties to protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, our monitoring of the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by us or by third parties may be compromised and expose us to liability for such breach.\nIf we are unable to detect material weaknesses in our internal control, our financial reporting and our Company may be adversely affected.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K for that fiscal year. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been, or will be, detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future. A material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to consider our internal controls as ineffective. If our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective, we may experience a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nIf our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq, our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected, and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired.\nOn December 27, 2017, we received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market (the \u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, for 30 consecutive days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq. To regain compliance, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on October 1, 2018. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq.\nAny delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades, and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be materially adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Furthermore, certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for those shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, and other factors.\nSome factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u25cf our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new technology;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u25cf developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf our inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u25cf concern as to the efficacy of our technology;\n\u25cf changes in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, other comparable companies, or our industry generally.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our stockholders could negatively affect our stock price.\nOn December 28, 2018, in a private placement transaction, we sold 2,940,767 shares of our common stock to existing investors including two current members of our Board of Directors and eight current employees.\nIn August 2017, we sold 975,000 shares to new investors, including two current members of our Board of Directors. We also issued warrants to purchase up to 325,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. The 2017 Warrants became exercisable on August 8, 2018, and will expire on August 8, 2020. None of the warrants have been exercised to date.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by insiders or large stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur ability to issue shares of common stock is limited currently due to the lack of sufficient shares of authorized stock.\nWe have issued or reserved substantially all our available shares of authorized common stock. Unless and until a sufficient number of options or warrants expire or the number of shares of our authorized common stock increases, our ability to obtain liquidity through equity sales may be limited. Although we anticipate proposing an increase in our authorized common stock at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, there can be no assurance that our stockholders will approve such an increase. An inability in the future to issue additional shares of common stock may adversely affect our capacity to raise additional capital, pursue strategic investments, and incentive employees.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us could adversely affect its price, and our future capital-raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which would dilute your investment and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur long-term success is dependent on us obtaining sufficient capital to fund our operations and to develop our touch technology and bringing our technology to the worldwide market to obtain sufficient sales volume to be profitable. We may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nA limited number of stockholders, including directors, hold a significant number of shares of our outstanding common stock.\nOur two largest stockholders, including the Chairman of our Board of Directors, hold approximately one-third of the shares of our outstanding voting stock. A significant number of additional shares of our common stock are beneficially owned by current and previous members of our management and our Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership could impact the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or our voting control.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts and other third parties choose to publish about us. We do not control these analysts or other third parties. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if one or more securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or cease publishing reports about us.", "PERMNO": 68145, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "NEON"}
