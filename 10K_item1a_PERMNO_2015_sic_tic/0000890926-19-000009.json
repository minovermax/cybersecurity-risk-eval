{"cik": "890926", "company": "RADIAN GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRadian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer\u2019s financial condition, as well as extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of a mortgage insurer\u2019s business. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe PMIERs financial requirements currently require that a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. At December 31, 2018, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and had Available Assets under the PMIERs of $3.5 billion, which resulted in an excess or \u201ccushion\u201d of $567 million over its Minimum Required Assets of $2.9 billion. Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by: (i) the product mix of our NIW and factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including our level of defaults, prepayments, the losses we incur on new or existing defaults and\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nthe credit characteristics of our mortgage insurance; (ii) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions (which is subject to initial and ongoing review by the GSEs), including the credit received for our quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance programs; and (iii) potential updates to the PMIERs, including an increase in the capital requirements under the PMIERs financial requirements.\nUnder the PMIERs financial requirements there are increased financial requirements for loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO scores, as well as for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it increases the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. Depending on the circumstances, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our revenues. Additionally, as we have experienced in the past, our insured loans may experience increased delinquencies in the future. Increases in delinquencies, including as a result of natural disasters, would subject Radian Guaranty to an increase in Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs, and therefore, could impact our compliance with the PMIERs or negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe GSEs may amend the PMIERs at any time, although the GSEs have communicated that for material changes, including material changes affecting Minimum Required Assets, they will generally provide written notice 180 days prior to the effective date. The GSEs also have broad discretion to interpret the PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets and/or Minimum Required Assets. On September 27, 2018, the GSEs issued PMIERs 2.0, which will become effective on March 31, 2019. Radian expects to comply with PMIERs 2.0 and to continue to maintain a significant excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets as of the effective date. If applied as of December 31, 2018, the changes under PMIERs 2.0 would not have resulted in a material change in Radian\u2019s Minimum Required Assets, but would have reduced Radian\u2019s PMIERs cushion. The reduction in Radian Guaranty\u2019s PMIERs cushion is primarily due to a reduction in Available Assets of approximately $215 million as a result of the elimination in PMIERS 2.0 of any credit for future premiums for insurance policies written prior to and including 2008, which is permitted under the current PMIERs. If Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets and Minimum Required Assets were calculated as if the PMIERs 2.0 requirements were in effect, Radian Guaranty\u2019s Available Assets at December 31, 2018 would have resulted in an excess or \u201ccushion\u201d of approximately $340 million, or 12%, over its Minimum Required Assets. We expect the GSEs to continue to update the PMIERs periodically in the future, including if and when the CCF is finalized.\nCompliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity. If additional cash from Radian Group is required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements, it will leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group\u2019s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn addition to the PMIERs financial requirements, the PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These increased operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and have required substantial time and effort from management and our employees, which we expect will continue.\nThe PMIERs prohibit Radian Guaranty from engaging in certain activities such as insuring loans originated or serviced by an affiliate (except under certain circumstances) and require Radian Guaranty to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include entering into various intercompany agreements and commuting or reinsuring risk, among others. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or its affiliates.\nAlthough we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as updated by PMIERs 2.0 or in the future, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of our investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business. Among other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries.\nState insurance capital requirements for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries include Risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write. Similarly, our title insurance subsidiary is required to maintain statutory premium reserves that vary by state and is subject to periodic reviews of certain financial performance ratios, and the states in which it is licensed can impose additional capital requirements based on the results of those ratios. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital, among other things, could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.\nIf Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with a state\u2019s applicable Statutory RBC Requirement, it may be prohibited from writing new business in that state until it is back in compliance or it receives a waiver of, or similar relief from, the requirement. As of December 31, 2018, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements. In states that do not have a Statutory RBC Requirement, it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if a mortgage insurer fails to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement established by another state. If Radian Guaranty were to fail to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement in one or more states, it could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which it does business. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty while it was not in compliance. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states.\nRadian Group also may be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and its affiliated insurers if additional capital is required by those subsidiaries pursuant to future changes to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. In the event the NAIC adopts changes to the Model Act, we expect that the capital requirements in states that adopt the new Model Act may increase as a result of the changes. Although the outcome of this process remains uncertain, we believe that if changes are made to the Model Act it will not result in financial requirements that require greater capital than the level currently required under the PMIERs financial requirements.\nThe mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries\u2019 premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must be approved, before their use. We may be subject to regulatory inquiries or examinations with respect to our mortgage insurance premium rates and policy forms.\nOur title insurance business is subject to extensive rate regulation by the applicable state agencies in the states in which it operates. Title insurance rates are regulated differently in various states, with some states requiring the subsidiaries to file and receive approval of rates before such rates become effective and some states promulgating the rates that can be charged. In general, premium rates are determined on the basis of historical data for claim frequency and severity as well as related production costs and other expenses.\nGiven that the premium rates for our insurance subsidiaries are highly regulated, we could lose business opportunities and fail to successfully implement our business strategies if we are unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers\u2019 demands in a timely and compliant manner.\nThe credit performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.\nAs a seller of mortgage credit protection, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the housing finance and real estate markets, including events that impact mortgage originations and the credit\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nperformance of our mortgage insurance portfolio. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including , housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors that may be derived from national and regional economic conditions. In general, a deterioration in economic conditions increases the likelihood that borrowers will be unable to satisfy their mortgage obligations. A deteriorating economy can adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.\nMortgage defaults also can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, or other events. In addition, factors impacting regional economic conditions, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions or other catastrophic events such as natural disasters could result in increased defaults due to the impact of such events on the ability of borrowers to satisfy their mortgage obligations and the value of affected homes.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic developments and the other factors cited above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force could decline and result in a decrease in our future revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 70% of our total primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies. As a result, most of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant driver of our future revenues, with a lower overall Persistency Rate generally reducing our future revenues. The factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u2022\nprevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF, which affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022\napplicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our IIF;\n\u2022\nthe credit policies of lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay off a mortgage earlier than required.\nIf these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Monthly Premium Policies (or other policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future) remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate mortgage insurance losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.\nAs part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and general non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. Following the financial crisis, mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, and the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims we have received in more recent periods has significantly decreased. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as it did in the years following the financial crisis.\nIn addition, under our 2014 Master Policy, for NIW after October 1, 2014, our rights to conduct Loss Mitigation Activity generally are more limited than under our prior master insurance policies. Radian Guaranty offers 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in our 2014 Master Policy. Further, the FHFA and the GSEs have proposed revised GSE Rescission Relief Principles to, among other things, further limit the circumstances under which mortgage insurers may rescind coverage. We are in the process of incorporating these principles into a new master policy, which we expect will be effective during the second half of 2019. We currently are in discussions with the GSEs regarding the form of this new master policy, including as it relates to these proposed principles, which if adopted, are likely to further reduce our ability to rescind insurance coverage in the future. A reduction in the Loss Mitigation rights available under our master policy could result in higher losses than would have been the case under our existing Master Policies.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved many of these disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings beyond those we are currently facing. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.\nChanges in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\nOur current business model is highly dependent on the GSEs as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. The GSEs\u2019 federal charters generally require credit enhancement for low down payment mortgage loans (i.e., a loan amount that exceeds 80% of a home\u2019s value) in order for such loans to be eligible for purchase by them. Lenders generally have used private mortgage insurance to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. As a result, low down payment mortgages purchased by the GSEs generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs.\nThe GSEs\u2019 business practices may be impacted by their results of operations, by administrative policy decisions (such as a desire to increase the competitiveness of private capital executions in the secondary mortgage market) as well as by legislative or regulatory changes. Since September 2008, the GSEs have been operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. With respect to loans purchased by the GSEs, changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our mortgage insurance business and financial performance, including changes to:\n\u2022\neligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;\n\u2022\nunderwriting standards on mortgages they purchase;\n\u2022\npolicies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe level of mortgage insurance required, including expanding the loans that are eligible for reduced insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u2022\nthe terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies they acquire, including limitations on our ability to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u2022\nthe amount of loan level price adjustments (based on risk) or guarantee fees (which may result in a higher cost to borrowers) that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nThe FHFA has called for the GSEs to transfer a meaningful portion of credit risk, known as a \u201ccredit risk transfer,\u201d to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each of the last three years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. From 2013 through June 2018 the GSEs transferred risk on over $2.5 trillion of unpaid principal balance, and we expect these credit risk transfer transactions to continue. We have been participating in these credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional information about these programs may be found in Item 1. Business, see \u201cRegulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform\u201d and \u201cMortgage Insurance-Mortgage Insurance Business Overview-Mortgage Insurance Products-Other Mortgage Insurance Products-GSE Credit Risk Transfer.\u201d\nIt is difficult to predict what other types of credit risk transfer transactions and structures may be used in the future . If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level or standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions or other\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nstructures implemented by the GSEs is uncertain and hard to predict. For example, in 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of limited pilot programs, IMAGIN and EPMI, respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to sell to the GSEs loans with LTVs greater than 80%. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the PMIERs, which may create a competitive disadvantage for private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform\u201d\nSince the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there has been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. In addition, the Trump administration and U.S. Treasury have stated that they are seeking to advance housing finance reform, particularly if the U.S. Congress does not take action to end the current conservatorship of the GSEs. Under current law, the FHFA has significant discretion with respect to the future state of the GSEs, including the ability to place the GSEs into receivership without further legislative action. The term of the most recent director of the FHFA ended in January 2019 and an acting director was appointed, pending the U.S. Senate\u2019s confirmation of the Administration\u2019s nominee to lead the FHFA. With new leadership at FHFA, we believe there may be an increased likelihood that the Administration could take action to reform the GSEs through current authorities of the director under The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and through Executive Order.\nThe future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including whether comprehensive housing reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it may ultimately take. It is difficult to predict the impact of any changes on our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform.\u201d Although we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, developments in the practices of the GSEs, including potentially new federal legislation that reduces the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminates the requirement, may diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new mortgage insurance business.\nThe amount of new business we write depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance. The volume of low down payment mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, capital requirements affecting lenders, regulatory requirements, and the health of the private securitization market;\n\u2022\nmortgage interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nhousing affordability;\n\u2022\ntax laws and policies and their impact on, among other things, deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes;\n\u2022\ndemographic trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u2022\nthe rate of home price appreciation;\n\u2022\ngovernment housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u2022\nthe practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments (based on risk), credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect the cost of mortgages and lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nIf the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and likely will be subject to increased competition, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and our financial condition.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nDuring 2018, our top 10 mortgage insurance customers (measured by NIW) were responsible for 29.1% of our primary NIW, as compared to 32.4% in 2017. If we were to lose a significant customer, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Some of our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, certain other lending customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business, which has negatively affected our level of NIW and market share with those customers. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that if there is further diversification it could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business from such customers at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors primarily include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.\nWe currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, reputation, perceived financial strength (including based on comparative financial strength credit ratings) and overall service. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, customer service, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise. We also believe that service includes our ability to offer services to customers through our Services business that complement our mortgage insurance products. For more information about our competitive environment, including pricing competition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Mortgage Insurance-Competition.\u201d\nIn developing our pricing and origination strategies, we monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to increase the long-term value of our portfolio by balancing both profitability and volume considerations. Pricing strategies continue to evolve in the mortgage insurance industry and mortgage insurers are migrating toward offering various pricing methodologies with increasing degrees of risk-based granularity. Our strategy is to consistently apply an approach to pricing that is customer-centric based on a lender\u2019s loan origination process, flexible and customizable, as well as balanced with our objectives for managing the risk and return profile of our insured portfolio. Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns and we may lose business to other competitors. There can be no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in our projected returns.\nCertain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations, may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and currently have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including in the private label securitization market or if the GSEs expand their use of, or pursue alternative forms of, credit enhancement outside of private mortgage insurance in its traditional form. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, certain of our competitors have been able to reinsure to their offshore affiliates and achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to on-shore mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW.\nWe also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, primarily on the basis of loan limits, pricing, credit guidelines, terms of our insurance policies and loss mitigation practices. These governmental entities typically do not have the\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nsame capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market, including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines, sometimes at a lower monthly cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance. The FHA may continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position. Factors that could cause the FHA to remain a significant competitor include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental policy, including decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of FHA insurance such as the current life-of-loan coverage requirement;\n\u2022\ncapital constraints of the private mortgage insurance industry;\n\u2022\nthe tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on credit risk concerns;\n\u2022\nbusiness changes by the GSEs, including underwriting changes, a reduction in loan limits or increases in the loan level price adjustments (based on risk) charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that they acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers); and\n\u2022\nthe perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers.\nOther private mortgage insurers may seek to compete for market share from the FHA or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing, which could, in turn, improve their competitive position in the industry and negatively impact our level of NIW.\nWe have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA accounted for 25% of the insurable mortgage market in 2018. We believe that the VA\u2019s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA\u2019s program.\nIn addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form, including:\n\u2022\nstructures, such as the limited pilot programs IMAGIN and EPMI launched in 2018 by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, respectively, that are commonly referred to as \u201cinvestor paid mortgage insurance\u201d in which affiliates of traditional mortgage insurers directly insure the GSEs against loss;\n\u2022\nlenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolio and self-insuring;\n\u2022\nlenders using pass-through vehicles that take on the risk of loss for loans ultimately sold to the GSEs;\n\u2022\nstructured risk transfer transactions in the capital markets;\n\u2022\nrisk sharing, risk transfer or using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nlenders originating mortgages using \u201cpiggyback\u201d structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first-lien mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV, which could become more attractive given that interest on piggyback loans remains tax deductible while the tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums has not been extended beyond the 2017 tax year; and\n\u2022\nother potential forms of credit enhancement that do not involve private mortgage insurance.\nSee \u201c-Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\u201d\nManaging the competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of factors discussed above. If we do not appropriately manage the strategic decisions required in this environment, our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Changes in the servicing industry, challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults could negatively affect the ability of servicers to effectively service the loans that we insure. Further, servicers are required to comply with more burdensome requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages than in the past, such as the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to improve servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, this, in turn, could contribute to a rise in defaults and/or claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAn extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\nHigh levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory, and as a result, the Claim Severity. Following the financial crisis, the average time that it took for us to receive a claim increased. This was, in part, due to loss mitigation protocols that were established by servicers and also to a significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states, and especially in those states that impose a judicial process for foreclosures. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the Claim Severity. While foreclosure timelines have improved in recent years, a portion of our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 consists of severely delinquent loans. Further, another period of significant economic stress and a high level of defaults could once again delay claims and result in higher levels of Claim Severity. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur future provisions for losses beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premiums are based on, among other items, the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks and our estimates of the long-term risk of claims on insured loans. Our premium rates are established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics, as well as market and economic conditions. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nIf the risk underlying a mortgage loan we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As a result, our losses can be more severe in periods of high defaults given that we generally are not permitted to establish reserves in anticipation of such defaults.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood,\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nmagnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA portion of the defaulted loans in our portfolio originated in the years prior to and including 2008 have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults.\nIf our estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian\u2019s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines in accordance with the endorsement. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide third-party contract underwriting services for both our mortgage insurance and Services customers. We provide these customers with limited indemnification rights with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may also offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation defenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.\nThe current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position.\nRadian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody\u2019s and a rating of BBB+ by S&P. While Radian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, these ratings are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, the current PMIERs and PMIERs 2.0 will not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, but if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs.\nThe GSEs currently consider financial strength ratings, among other items, to determine the amount of collateral that an insurer must post when participating in the credit risk transfer transactions currently being conducted by the GSEs. As a result, the returns that we are able to achieve when participating in these transactions are dependent, in part, on our financial strength ratings. We currently use Radian Reinsurance to participate in the GSEs\u2019 credit risk transfer transactions. Radian Reinsurance has been assigned a rating of BBB+ by S&P. Market participants with higher ratings than us generally have the ability to price more aggressively, and therefore, are better positioned than us to compete in these transactions.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-qualified mortgage loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential future growth and our ability to participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nno longer operate in their current capacity or loans purchased by the GSEs were no longer automatically deemed qualified mortgages under the QM Rule, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we hold positions has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, and if this worsens substantially it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough in recent years our portfolio yield has been increasing, interest rates and investment yields on our investments continue to be below historical averages, which has reduced the investment income we generate. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in highly-rated investments that are unlikely to increase our investment returns. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could potentially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the NAIC Model Act or PMIERs could impact our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy.\nIn addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. As of December 31, 2018, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of $714.1 million. This amount excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in October 2017, was $981.6 million as of December 31, 2018.\nRadian Group\u2019s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) the payment of $159 million principal amount of our outstanding Senior Notes due 2019; (iii) interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations; and (iv) the payment of dividends on our common stock. Radian Group\u2019s liquidity demands for the next 12 months or in future periods could also include: (i) the potential use of up to $100 million to repurchase Radian Group common stock pursuant to the existing share repurchase authorization; (ii) capital support for Radian Guaranty and our other insurance subsidiaries; (iii) repayments, repurchases or early redemptions of portions of our debt obligations; and (iv) potential investments to support our business strategy.\nIn addition to existing available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group\u2019s principal sources of cash to fund future short-term liquidity needs include payments made to Radian Group under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries. Radian Group has expense-sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on most of our outstanding senior notes. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.\nThe Services segment has not generated sufficient cash flows to pay dividends to Radian Group. Additionally, while cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay the Services segment\u2019s direct operating expenses, it has not been sufficient to satisfy its obligations to reimburse Radian Group for its allocated operating expense and interest expense under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements. We do not expect the Services segment will be able to bring its reimbursement obligations current for the\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nforeseeable future. In the event the cash flow from operations of the Services segment is not adequate to fund all of its needs, Radian Group may provide additional funds to the Services segment in the form of a capital contribution or an intercompany note. Further, in light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to our short-term liquidity needs discussed above, Radian Group\u2019s liquidity demands beyond the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the repayment of our outstanding debt obligations; and (ii) potential additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries. We expect to meet the long-term liquidity needs of Radian Group with a combination of: (i) available cash and marketable securities; (ii) private or public issuances of debt or equity securities, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all; (iii) cash received under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries; (iv) to the extent available, dividends from our subsidiaries; and (v) any amounts that Radian Guaranty is able to successfully redeem under the Surplus Note.\nAs of December 31, 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have incurred federal NOLs that could not be carried-back and utilized on a separate company tax return basis. As a result, we are not currently obligated under our tax-sharing agreement to reimburse these subsidiaries for their separate company federal NOL carryforward. However, if in a future period, one of these subsidiaries utilizes its share of federal NOL carryforwards on a separate entity basis, then Radian Group may be obligated to fund such subsidiary\u2019s share of our consolidated tax liability to the IRS. Certain subsidiaries, including Clayton, currently have federal NOLs on a separate entity basis that are available for future utilization. However, we do not expect to fund material obligations related to these subsidiary NOLs.\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity or by selling assets, any of which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. A default under our credit facility could trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it.\nRadian Group is a party to a $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders. Radian Group\u2019s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by Clayton and may in the future be guaranteed by other subsidiaries of Radian Group. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, provide certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies and pay dividends. The credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and further provides that (i) Radian Group must be rated by S&P or Moody\u2019s and (ii) Radian Guaranty must remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could (i) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (ii) enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable.\nFurther, the occurrence of an event of default under the terms of our credit facility may trigger an event of default under the terms of our senior notes. An event of default occurs under the terms of our senior notes if a default (i) in any scheduled payment of principal of other indebtedness by Radian Group or its subsidiaries of more than $100 million principal amount occurs, after giving effect to any applicable grace period or (ii) in the performance of any term or provision of any indebtedness of Radian Group or its subsidiaries in excess of $100 million principal amount that results in the acceleration of the date such indebtedness is due and payable, subject to certain limited exceptions. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the carrying value of our senior notes.\nIf the commitments of the lenders are terminated or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the credit facility when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If there were to be an event of default under our credit facility or senior notes for any reason, our cash flows, financial results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.\nWe have significant holdings of trading securities, equity securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.\nAdditionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. We rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide our products and services to our customers, and they generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with business partners with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing relationships with mortgage insurance or mortgage and real estate services providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.\nBecause we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption, or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we are in the process of implementing a major technology project to improve our operating systems, including a new platform for our mortgage insurance underwriting, policy administration, claims management and billing processes. The implementation of these technological improvements is complex, expensive, time consuming and, in certain respects, depends on the ability of third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner. If we fail to timely and successfully implement the new technology systems and business processes, or if the systems do not operate as expected, it could have an adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, including cyberattacks. As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on borrowers, consumers and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any cybersecurity or other compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage to our reputation and customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We often are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Increased scrutiny in the current regulatory environment could lead to new regulations and practices, new interpretations of existing regulations, as well as additional regulatory proceedings. Additional lawsuits, legal\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nand regulatory proceedings and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of existing and future legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nLegislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nlegislation, administrative or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;\n\u2022\nreform of the U.S. housing finance system;\n\u2022\nlegislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers;\n\u2022\nstate insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nthe application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;\n\u2022\nthe application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to our businesses;\n\u2022\nthe interpretation and application of the TRID rules requiring enhanced disclosures to consumers in connection with the origination of residential mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nnew federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the recommendation of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Treasury that federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers be developed and implemented;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of new regulations under, or the potential repeal or amendment of provisions of, the Dodd-Frank Act, including changes in the QM Rule; and\n\u2022\nthe implementation in the U.S. of the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nAny of the items discussed above could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.\nThe implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\nOver the past few decades, the Basel Committee has established international benchmarks for assessing banks\u2019 capital adequacy requirements (\u201cBasel III\u201d). Included within those benchmarks are capital standards related to residential lending and securitization activity and importantly for private mortgage insurers, the capital treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. These benchmarks are then interpreted and implemented via rulemaking by U.S. banking regulators. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations, referred to as the \u201cU.S. Basel III Rules,\u201d to implement significant elements of the Basel framework. The U.S. Basel III Rules, among other things, revise and enhance the U.S. banking agencies\u2019 general risk-based capital rules. Today, the U.S. Basel III Rules assign a 20%, 50% or 100% risk weight to loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties. Generally, under the U.S. Basel III Rules in place today, the explicit government guarantees (FHA/VA/USDA) receive a 0% risk weight, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac related loans receive a 20% risk weight. Non-government related mortgage exposures secured by a first lien on a one-to-four family residential property that are prudently underwritten and that are performing according to their original terms receive a 50% risk weighting. All other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are assigned a 100% risk weight.\nIn December 2014, the Basel Committee issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV ratio and the borrower\u2019s ability to service a mortgage, which were not previously addressed by Basel III. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance, but in March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that for purposes of the U.S. Basel III Rules, calculation of LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\ndetermining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50% risk weight. The comment period for this proposal closed in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee released a second proposal, referred to as the 2015 Basel Committee Proposal, which retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the provisions pertaining to a borrower\u2019s ability to service a mortgage. The comment period for the 2015 Basel Committee Proposal closed in March 2016. To date, federal regulators have not adopted or implemented any new regulations, including based on these proposals, that update or modify the U.S. Basel III Rules.\nThe revised and final recommendations from the Basel Committee with respect to Basel III, referred to as the 2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations, were published in December 2017, and finalized risk weighting guidelines for residential mortgage exposures. These rules recognize guarantees provided by sovereign governments (such as FHA, VA, USDA and Ginnie Mae) as off-setting the capital requirements, resulting in a 0% risk weight. While the 2017 Basel Committee III Recommendations include consideration of LTV ratios, including the impact of credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs on LTV ratios, the credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs would have higher risk weightings than the explicitly government guaranteed products, putting loans insured by private mortgage insurance at a disadvantage. It remains unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized in the U.S. in response to the most recent 2017 Basel III Committee Recommendations.\nIf the federal regulators decide to change the current U.S. Basel III Rules in response to the final 2017 Basel III Committee Recommendations in ways that increase the capital requirements of banking organizations with respect to the residential mortgages we insure or that are guaranteed by the GSEs, demand for our mortgage insurance could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business and business prospects.\nWe rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including costs associated with a loss of productivity and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new business initiatives, acquire other companies or engage in other strategic initiatives, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties.\nIn support of our growth strategy, we may make strategic investments, acquisitions or pursue other strategic initiatives that expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic investment, including any acquired business;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business, or other business or strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other strategic investment or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic investment, acquisition or other initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired.\nGlossary\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe face risks associated with our Services business.\nWe expanded our business to include our Services segment through our 2014 acquisition of Clayton and our subsequent acquisitions of Red Bell, ValuAmerica, EnTitle Direct, Independent Settlement Services and the assets of Five Bridges. Our Services business exposes us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nOur Services revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Services total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWhile Clayton is not a defendant in litigation arising out of the financial crisis involving the issuance of RMBS in connection with which it has provided services, it has in the past, and may again in the future, receive subpoenas from various parties to provide documents and information related to such litigation, and there can be no assurance that Clayton will not be subject to future claims against it, whether in connection with such litigation or otherwise. It is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from our Services business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our Services engagements are transactional in nature and may be performed in connection with securitizations, loan sales, loan purchases or other transactions. Due to the transactional nature of our business, our Services segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022\nSales of our mortgage, real estate and title services are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally, and are specifically dependent on the mortgage loan origination volumes of our customers which may fluctuate from period to period. If mortgage origination volumes decline we could experience less demand for our mortgage, real estate and title services.\n\u2022\nRed Bell is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services (\u201cMLS\u201d). Red Bell receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise were to lose access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell\u2019s ability to conduct its business.\n\u2022\nBy their nature, title claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims, the long periods of time over which claims are paid, significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. From time to time, we could experience large losses or an overall worsening of our loss payment experience in regard to the frequency or severity of claims that require us to record additional charges to our claims loss reserve. These loss events are unpredictable and could adversely affect the financial performance of our Services business.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
