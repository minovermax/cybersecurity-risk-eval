{"cik": "1627014", "company": "Black Knight, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe extent to which health epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto affect our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the industries and communities in which we and our clients, suppliers and business partners operate.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity.\nThe pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe pandemic has adversely affected the operations of our clients, suppliers and business partners. On March 18, 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\"FHFA\") announced a 60-day moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. Likewise, the FHFA also announced forbearance programs for impacted borrowers, allowing mortgage payments to be suspended for up to 12 months. Managing the many aspects of forbearance programs mandated by the FHFA, HUD and the CARES Act may present operational challenges for many servicers of mortgage loans.\nSubsequent to the CARES Act, the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\") extended the moratorium on mortgage loan foreclosures and evictions through at least June 30, 2021. In addition, many states have implemented additional guidance that extends their moratorium on mortgage loan foreclosures and evictions, and additional extensions of these moratoriums may be implemented in the future.\nWe may experience financial impacts due to a number of heightened risks, including:\n\u2022lower foreclosure-related transactional revenues in the near term due to the mortgage loan foreclosure moratorium and mortgage loan forbearance plans offered as part of the CARES Act, which may have a negative effect on revenue growth;\n\u2022clients' slow-down of implementations, which may delay revenues to future periods;\n\u2022challenges to the availability and reliability of our data, solutions and services due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of COVID-19 cases affecting our employees who may become sick and unable to work or affecting the employees of our clients or other third parties on which we depend;\n\u2022higher costs related to employee benefit plans, primarily medical costs, due to any potential increase in COVID-19 cases affecting our employees;\n\u2022an increased volume of unanticipated client, regulatory and other third party requests for information and support, or additional regulatory requirements, which could require additional resources and costs to address; and\n\u2022increased risk of data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches as opportunistic threat actors continue to identify innovative methods of stealing sensitive information by relying on the urgency associated with a COVID-19 pandemic scenario.\nThese risks may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clients and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its effect, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse effects to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s economic effect, including the availability of credit, adverse effects on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred.\nThere are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the effects on our business, our operations or the economy. However, the effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below.\nWe rely on our top clients for a significant portion of our revenues and profits, which makes us susceptible to the same macro-economic and regulatory factors that affect our clients. If these clients are negatively affected by economic or regulatory conditions or otherwise experience financial hardship or stress, or if we are unable to renew existing agreements or the terms of our relationships with these clients change, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur clients are in a relatively consolidated industry and, as a result, a small number of our clients have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The significant portion of our revenues that a limited number of our clients currently represent may increase in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues.\nMany of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our business and results of operations, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, we rely on cross-selling our products and services to our existing clients as a source of growth. The deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may be disproportionately affected by declining revenues from, or loss of, a significant client. In addition, by virtue of their significant relationships with us, these clients may be able to exert pressure on us with respect to the pricing of our services.\nThe time and expense associated with switching from our competitors' software and services to ours may limit our growth.\nThe costs for a mortgage lender or servicer to switch providers of software, data and analytics solutions and services can be significant and the process can take 12 to 18 months, or longer, to complete. As a result, potential clients may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our solutions and services, even if we offer competitive and economic advantages. If we are unable to convince these prospective clients to switch to our software and services, our ability to increase market share will be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our growth.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our client contracts, including commitments to provide high-quality technical support services. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, it may adversely affect our reputation and relationship with our clients or we could face contract terminations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur client agreements typically provide service level commitments measured on a daily and monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications, we may be contractually obligated to provide these clients with service credits or refunds or we could face contract terminations. If we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our clients or if we experience any extended service outages, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing clients. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients and we are subject to various governmental regulations, and a failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes in these regulations, including changes that may result from changes in the political landscape, could result in penalties, restrict or limit our or our clients' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations.\nMany of our clients' and our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenues.\nAs a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the FFIEC, the CFPB, the OCC, the FDIC and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.\nA portion of our Compass Analytics, LLC (\"Compass Analytics\") business provides risk management, loan sales (best execution) and general secondary marketing advisory and hedge execution services in concert with licensing Compass Analytics\u2019 mortgage loan valuation and risk management analytics to its clients. Through this business, Compass Analytics may advise clients regarding their best practices, strategic relationships and workflow, but earns no commission or compensation for\nany trade execution or volume and does not have custody of any client funds or securities. Compass Analytics offers these advisory services to mortgage loan originators and servicers, including mortgage banks, community and commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage loan insurers, government agencies, investors, Federal Home Loan Banks and real estate investment trusts. As a result, Compass Analytics is registered with and regulated by the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (\"Investment Advisers Act\"). The failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a fine or sanction or the fine or sanction imposed against us or our employees by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients.\nIn addition, our businesses are subject to an increased degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to write rules affecting the business of, supervise, conduct examinations of and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations with respect to certain \"non-depository covered persons\" determined by the CFPB to be \"larger participants\" that offer consumer financial products and services. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the OCC also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider to large financial institutions. In addition, we believe some of our largest bank clients' regulators are requiring the banks to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key service providers such as us.\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\") and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. RESPA and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estate-related businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements. The CFPB is responsible for enforcing RESPA.\nChanges to laws and regulations and regulatory oversight of our clients and us, including those that may result from changes in the political landscape, may cause us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases or otherwise limit the manner in which we conduct our business. We may also incur additional expense in keeping our software solutions services up to date as laws and regulations change, and we may not be able to pass those additional costs on to our clients. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, participants in the mortgage lending industry may develop policies pursuant to which they limit the extent to which they can rely on any one vendor or service provider. Conversely, in an environment with less stringent regulatory oversight, prospective clients may choose to retain their in-house platforms, or current service providers, or seek alternative service providers who provide services that are less compliance and quality oriented at a lower price point. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to increased or evolving laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative effect on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be consolidation in our end client market, which could reduce the use of our services by our clients.\nConsolidations among existing or potential clients could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. If our clients merge with, are acquired by or sell their servicing portfolios to other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. In addition, if potential clients merge, our ability to increase our client base may be adversely affected and the ability of our clients to exert pressure on our pricing may increase. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nParticipants in the mortgage loan industry are subject to efforts by the government to regulate the mortgage loan industry or address the mortgage loan market and current economic environment.\nThe mortgage loan industry is heavily regulated and continues to be subject to review by governmental authorities. Inquiries may include federal and state governmental review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business. Such efforts may include actions to address the housing market and the economy in general and to maintain rigorous mortgage loan servicing standards.\nAdditional state and federal government actions directed at housing and the mortgage loan industry may occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients' relationships with government-sponsored enterprises (\"GSEs\") are subject to change.\nOur clients have significant relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are GSEs tasked with working with financial institutions to provide liquidity to the mortgage loan market. The GSEs do this by purchasing loans from the lenders either for cash or in exchange for mortgage-backed securities that are backed by those loans and that, for a fee, carry the GSEs'\nguarantee of timely payment of interest and principal to investors of those mortgage-backed securities. Because our clients service the loans owned by GSEs, we provide solutions and services for many of those loans. As a result of these relationships, GSEs have been able to implement changes to our pricing structure on certain products and services we provide. GSEs or other governmental agencies may be able to exert similar pressure on the pricing of our solutions and services in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to adapt our solutions to technological changes or evolving industry standards and regulations, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade, modernize or innovate our technology are not successful, we may not be able to achieve our growth strategies and we could lose clients and have difficulty attracting new clients for our solutions.\nThe markets for our solutions are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards and regulations. Our growth strategies and future success will be significantly affected by our ability to successfully enhance our current solutions, and to develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product or service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance issues. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new solutions and services that meet these changing demands, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these solutions and services or that our new solutions and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If our efforts are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment and, if we are unable to compete effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe markets for our solutions are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial resources. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, because many of our larger existing or potential clients have historically developed their key processing applications in-house, and therefore, view their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we often compete against our existing or potential clients' in-house capabilities. As a result, gaining new clients in our servicing and origination software businesses can be difficult. For banks and other potential clients, switching from an internally designed system to an outside vendor, or from one vendor of servicing and origination software services to a new vendor, is a significant undertaking. These potential clients worry about possible disadvantages such as loss of custom functionality, increased costs and business disruption. As a result, these potential clients often resist change. There can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients' reluctance to change will be successful, and if we are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our data and information solutions may decrease.\nPublic sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue. Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for, or the price that clients are willing to pay for, our data and information solutions. To the extent that clients choose not to obtain data and information from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if we are unable to protect our rights, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our applications, solutions, including those that contain \"open source\" software, or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others or fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.\nWe use a limited amount of software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses and may continue to use such software in the future. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by the United States or other courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. We cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our solutions. In addition, many of the risks associated with using open source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our information technology applications and services develop, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022cause us to cease providing solutions that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022require us to redesign our solutions, if feasible;\n\u2022divert management's attention and resources; and\n\u2022require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.\nAny one or more of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may be liable for damages for past infringement if a court determines that our software or technologies infringe upon a third party's patent or other proprietary rights.\nWe depend on our ability to access data from external sources to maintain and grow our businesses. If we are unable to access needed data from these sources or if the prices charged for these services increase, the quality, pricing and availability of our solutions may be adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use. If a number of suppliers are no longer able or are unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs and reduced quality of our services. Moreover, some of our data suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them. Significant price increases could require us to seek other sources of data on more favorable economic terms, which may not be available at all. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international third-party service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe have sought to reduce our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the United States. Other countries may be subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the United States and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions can affect our ability to deliver our solutions on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent can decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Weakness of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currency used and higher inflation rates experienced in other countries may also reduce anticipated savings. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the United States. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced United States-based labor to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other countries could adopt new legislation or regulations that could make it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. In addition, in many foreign countries,\nparticularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") or other local anti-corruption laws. Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us or our subsidiaries, could result in substantial financial and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience system failures or service interruptions that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.\nWe depend heavily upon the computer systems and our existing technology infrastructure located in our data centers. Certain system interruptions or events beyond our control could interrupt or terminate the delivery of our solutions and services to our clients and may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees' ability to perform their responsibilities.\nThese potential interruptions include, but are not limited to, damage or interruption from hurricanes, floods, fires, power losses, telecommunications outages, cyber-based attacks, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors and similar events. Our U.S. corporate offices and one of our data centers are located in Jacksonville, Florida, which is an area that is at high risk of hurricane and flood damage. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. The servers that we use through various third-party service providers may also be vulnerable to similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays and loss of critical data. Such service providers may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, and our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nDefects in our software solutions, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions, or other difficulties could result in:\n\u2022interruption of business operations;\n\u2022delay in market acceptance;\n\u2022us, or our clients, missing a regulatory deadline;\n\u2022additional development and remediation costs;\n\u2022diversion of technical and other resources;\n\u2022loss of clients;\n\u2022negative publicity; or\n\u2022exposure to liability claims.\nAny one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability.\nWe may experience delays or difficulty in developing or implementing new, enhanced or existing software, data or hosting solutions, which may negatively affect our relationships with existing and potential clients, reduce or delay the generation of revenues or increase development and implementation costs.\nOur future financial performance depends upon the successful development, implementation and client acceptance of new, existing and enhanced versions of our software and hosting solutions. We continually seek to develop enhancements to our solutions, including updates in response to changes in applicable laws, as well as new offerings to supplement our existing solutions. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in the development and integration of new technologies, including defects or undetected errors in our software solutions, difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients or other unanticipated performance, stability and compatibility problems. Any of these problems could result in material delays in the introduction or acceptance of our solutions, increased costs, decreased client satisfaction, breach of contract claims, harm to our industry reputation and reduced or delayed revenues. If we are unable to implement existing solutions or deliver new solutions or upgrades or other enhancements to our existing solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as a significant focus of our sales efforts is on the top U.S. mortgage loan originators and servicers, larger clients may demand more complex integration, implementation services and features, which may result in implementations that take longer than we forecast or delays in these clients using our solutions. Furthermore, if implementations take longer than planned or these clients delay their use of our solutions, we may be required to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met, and we may not generate revenues from these clients as quickly as we had forecast.\nBecause our revenues from clients in the mortgage lending industry are affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a change in any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from software and hosting solutions, professional services and data solutions we provide to the mortgage loan industry and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The volume of mortgage loan origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable and reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct effect on the revenues we generate from our software solutions business and some of our data and analytics businesses.\nThe revenues we generate from our servicing software solutions primarily depend upon the total number of mortgage loans processed on MSP\u00ae, which tends to be comparatively consistent regardless of economic conditions. However, in the event that a difficult economy or other factors lead to a decline in levels of home ownership and a reduction in the number of mortgage loans outstanding and we are not able to counter the effect of those events with increased market share or higher fees, our MSP\u00ae revenues could be adversely affected. Moreover, negative economic conditions, including increased unemployment or interest rates or a downturn in other general economic factors, among other things, could adversely affect the performance and financial condition of some of our clients in many of our businesses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses.\nA weaker economy and housing market tend to increase the volume of consumer mortgage loan defaults, which can increase revenues from our applications focused on supporting default management functions. However, government regulation of the mortgage loan industry in general, and the default and foreclosure process in particular, has greatly slowed the processing of defaulted mortgage loans and has changed the way many of our clients address mortgage loans in default. A downturn in the origination market and a concurrent slowdown or change in the way mortgage loans in default are addressed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our technology and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients.\nOur business relies on large numbers of skilled employees, and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire may increase. We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. Increased competition for employees could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.\nRisks Related to Our Investment in DNB\nOur investment in DNB may expose us to certain risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have invested $492.6 million in Dun & Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cDNB\u201d). Refer to Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDNB may not be successful in developing and implementing its strategic plans to transform its businesses, including realigning management, simplifying and scaling technology, expanding and enhancing data and optimizing its client services. If the development or implementation of its plans are not successful, DNB may not produce the revenue, margins or earnings that it expects, including offsetting the impact of adverse economic conditions that may exist currently or develop in the future. DNB may also face delays or difficulties in implementing technological, organizational and operational improvements, including its plans to leverage its data insights in new functional areas and utilize existing data architecture to generate high contribution incremental revenue streams, which could adversely affect its ability to successfully compete. In addition, the costs associated with implementing such plans may be more than anticipated and DNB may not have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with its plans. The existing and future execution of its strategic and operating plans to transform its business will, to some extent, also be dependent on external factors that DNB cannot control. In addition, these strategic and operational plans need to be continually reassessed to meet the challenges and\nneeds of its business in order for DNB to remain competitive. The failure to implement and execute its strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all, realize or maintain the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with such plans, have financial resources to fund the costs associated with such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts, or sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, which may result in us not realizing our expected return on investment, or a negative return on investment.\nOur investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, through which we record our proportionate share of DNB's net earnings or loss in our consolidated financial statements. Equity-method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If our equity-method investment is not recoverable, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDNB has elected to take advantage of the \u2018\u2018controlled company\u2019\u2019 exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly listed companies, which could make their common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm their stock price.\nBecause DNB qualifies as a \u2018\u2018controlled company\u2019\u2019 under the corporate governance rules for publicly listed companies, DNB is not required to have a majority of its Board of Directors be independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE, nor is it required to have a compensation committee or a corporate governance and nominating committee comprised entirely of independent directors, and its audit committee is not required to be comprised entirely of independent directors for a period of one year following the IPO. Accordingly, should the interests of the investor consortium, including Cannae Holdings, LLC (\"Cannae\"), affiliates of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (\"THL\"), Black Knight and CC Capital Partners LLC, differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. DNB's status as a controlled company could make its common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm its stock price and, thus, the value of our investment.\nRisks Related to Information Security\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, including breaches involving third-party vendors, or if we are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, and the evolving threat landscape can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information. Cyber-based attacks, including those to extort payment in return for the release of sensitive information, are increasing. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as \"phishing\" schemes, could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. If we are unable to prevent or detect such security or privacy breaches or our third-party vendors are unable to prevent or detect such breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits and regulatory-imposed restrictions and penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our large clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients, increase our operating or litigation costs or subject us to liability under those contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory developments with respect to use of consumer data and public records could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBecause our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. We acquire, store, use and provide many types of consumer data and related services that are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent security breaches, cyber-based attacks, other unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense and loss of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data, which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Further, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they have implemented or are seeking to implement further restrictions, such as the CCPA, CPRA, NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulations and Vermont Data Broker Law, on the acquisition, dissemination or commercial use of personal information within the public and private sectors and are also contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. Privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from state to state and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the cost and complexity of compliance. Any future laws, regulations or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of our solutions and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, violations of privacy laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business.\nOur reliance on third parties subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations. In addition, we may not realize the full benefit of our third-party arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect the service levels we are able to provide our clients.\nWe rely upon third parties for various business process and technology-related products and services, including cloud-based providers. Although we have contractual provisions with our providers that specify performance requirements, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, our failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in our vendors' businesses, financial condition and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations, which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. If for any reason our relationship with any of these third parties, including cloud-based providers, were to end unexpectedly, it could require a significant amount of cost and time to transition to new third-party service providers. The failure of our providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, or could result in loss of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur policies and procedures, including those related to cybersecurity, may prove inadequate for the risks we face.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. If our solutions change and as the markets in which we operate evolve, our strategies may not always adapt to such changes. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. Other of our methods of managing risk depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures or available information indicate. In addition, management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record and verify large numbers of transactions and events, which may not be fully effective. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. If our efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our clients, and sanctions or fines from regulators.\nRisk Related to Our Structure\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board of Directors have or will have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts.\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board of Directors serve on the Board of Directors of other entities or are employed by other entities, including DNB, Trasimene Capital Management, LLC (\"Trasimene\"), FNF, THL and Cannae.\nAs a result of the foregoing, there may be circumstances where certain executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our ongoing relationships with DNB, Trasimene, FNF, THL or Cannae; (ii) the quality, pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to DNB, Trasimene or FNF, or that they provide to us; (iii) business opportunities arising for any of us, DNB, Trasimene, FNF, THL or Cannae; and (iv) conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us.\nWe have in place a code of business conduct and ethics prescribing procedures for managing conflicts of interest and our chief compliance officer and audit committee are responsible for the review, approval or ratification of any potential conflicts of interest transactions. Additionally, we expect that interested directors will abstain from decisions with respect to conflicts of interest as a matter of practice. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective, that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nRefer to Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our related party relationships and transactions.\nWe are restricted from pursuing certain potential business opportunities under the non-competition agreement.\nIn connection with the Distribution, we entered into a non-competition agreement with FNF pursuant to which we agreed to certain restrictions on the scope of the business that we may conduct for the 10-year period following the Distribution, including that we are prohibited from (i) engaging in title generation/escrow services, appraisal or default and field services work (other than technology solutions for such settlement services) without the prior written consent of FNF (subject to an exception allowing us to acquire a business engaged in such restricted services if at least 90% of such business\u2019 revenues is contributed by activities other than such restricted services) and (ii) engaging in certain transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or sale of greater than 5% of its equity interests, with a buyer that derives 10% or more of its revenues from such restricted services. Although we do not presently engage in any of these restricted services and our current business is not restricted, as a result of these restrictions, we may have to forgo certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous in compliance with our obligations under the non-competition agreement.\nIn particular, the restriction on engaging in a merger, sale of assets or sale of greater than 5% of its equity interests with a buyer that derives 10% or more of its revenues from restricted services may discourage a third party engaged in such restricted services from pursuing such a transaction with us during the 10-year period following the Distribution.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to successfully consummate acquisitions or experience delays in integrating acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOne of our strategies to grow our business is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses, technologies and services. This strategy will depend on our ability to find suitable acquisitions and may depend on financing them on acceptable terms. We may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions, and doing so may be made more difficult by our indebtedness. Raising additional capital for acquisitions through debt financing could result in increased interest expense and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital for acquisitions through equity financing, the ownership interests of existing shareholders will be diluted.\nIf we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth. Further, we may face challenges in integrating any acquired business, including our acquisition of Optimal Blue. These challenges may include eliminating redundant operations, facilities and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate cultures, integrating relationships with clients, vendors and business partners while achieving revenue synergies, cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. The Optimal Blue acquisition involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks, including potential liabilities associated with the acquired business. Difficulties in integrating Optimal Blue and our ability to manage the combined company, may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the delay or failure to realize anticipated revenue synergies and cost-related efficiencies, and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, the acquisition and integration processes may disrupt our business and divert management attention and our resources. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of an acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. In addition, we may be required to record future charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from such acquisitions.\nWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets, and an extended economic downturn or troubled mortgage market could cause these investments to become impaired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors that may indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets, including\ngoodwill, may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. However, if there is an extended economic downturn in the future, the carrying amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could have a negative effect on our financing options and liquidity position, and certain of our financing arrangements subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.2 billion of total debt outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022requiring us to use a portion of the money we earn to pay principal and interest on our debt, which could reduce the amount of money available to finance operations, acquisitions and other business activities;\n\u2022exposing us to costs and risks associated with agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, as such agreements may not offer complete protection from these risks, and subjecting us to the risk that one or more of the counterparties to these agreements may fail to satisfy their obligations under such agreements;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition, by causing us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes and possibly limiting our ability to pursue other business opportunities and implement certain business strategies;\n\u2022imposing operating and financial restrictions on our activities, including compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things, take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities; and\n\u2022exposing us to possible losses in connection with our interest rate swaps that are indexed in LIBOR as result of proposed changes to LIBOR reporting practices or the pending replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our outstanding debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Risks associated with our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur senior leadership team is critical to our continued success, and the loss of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. We have attempted to mitigate this risk by entering into long-term (two to three year) employment contracts with the members of our senior management operating team and providing long-term incentive compensation with multi-year vesting provisions. If we lose key members of our senior management operating team or are unable to effect smooth transitions from one executive to another as part of our succession plan, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and future litigation, investigations or other actions against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees.\nOn November 5, 2019, Black Knight Servicing Technologies, LLC (\u201cBKST\u201d), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Black Knight, filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial (the \u201cBlack Knight Complaint\u201d) against PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (\u201cPennyMac\u201d). Shortly after the filing of the Black Knight Complaint, on November 6, 2019, PennyMac filed an Antitrust Complaint (the \u201cPennyMac Complaint\u201d) against Black Knight. Refer to Note 14 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the PennyMac litigation matter.\nLitigation can result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we also receive requests for information from various state and federal regulatory authorities, some of which take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. Some of these regulatory inquiries may result in the assessment of fines for violations of regulations or settlements with such authorities requiring a variety of remedies.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not incur additional material costs and expenses in connection with any potential future investigations or claims, including but not limited to fines or penalties and legal costs, or be subject to other remedies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance may not cover or be sufficient for such investigations and claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. An investigation or claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, management distraction or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") could delay or prevent us from entering into a strategic transaction with a third party, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our shareholders. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022provide that directors elected prior to 2020 may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other shareholders to reconstitute our Board of Directors;\n\u2022provide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our Board of Directors or by the chairman of the Board of Directors or our chief executive officer; and\n\u2022require advance notice to be given by shareholders for any shareholder proposals or director nominees.\nBy virtue of not opting out of Section 203 of the DGCL in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \"business combination\" with an \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years after the time the shareholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions, including if, prior to such time, the board of directors approved the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested stockholder. \"Business combinations\" include mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the \"interested stockholder.\" Subject to various exceptions, an \"interested stockholder\" is a person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or within three years did own 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. These restrictions generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change of control attempts that are not approved by a company's Board of Directors.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit shareholder value by impeding a sale of us.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which your shares were acquired. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022our operating performance and the performance of our competitors and fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022global, national or local economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022announcements of positive news by us or our competitors, such as announcements of new products, services, strategic investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022announcements of negative news by us or our competitors, such as announcements of poorer than expected results of operations, data breaches or significant litigation;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors' operating results, and our and our competitors' growth rates;\n\u2022failure by us or our competitors to meet analysts' projections or guidance we or our competitors may give the market;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022the arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022the number of shares publicly traded;\n\u2022future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales, distributions or issuances by us, our officers or directors and our significant shareholders; and\n\u2022other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may cause declines in the market price of our common stock, and you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nAs we primarily operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment. We have not paid cash dividends to date and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result of our current dividend policy, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 92697, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "BKI"}
