{"cik": "1746466", "company": "Equillium, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this report, before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the factors described as well as the other information in our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d when evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investments. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company incorporated in March 2017 and our operations, to date, have consisted of organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing rights to itolizumab (EQ001), conducting preclinical research, filing three INDs, commencing clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001), conducting business development activities, and the general and administrative activities associated with being a public company. We have never completed the development of any product candidate through to marketing approval, and we have never generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise. Consequently, we have no meaningful operations upon which to evaluate our business, and predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.\nInvestment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have never generated any revenues, and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net losses were $39.1 million and $29.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $110.0 million. We expect to incur increasing levels of operating losses for the foreseeable future as we execute our plan to continue our research and development activities into later stages of clinical development, potentially expand the indications for which we conduct clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001), potentially acquire new products and/or product candidates, seek regulatory approvals of and potentially commercialize any approved product candidates, hire additional personnel and protect our intellectual property. Furthermore, in connection with the acquisition of Bioniz, we have expanded our pipeline from one product candidate to three product candidates, all at various stages of development. This expansion may accelerate the rate at which our operating losses increase as we incur costs to further the development and seek regulatory approval for these product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur increased sales and marketing expenses, with certain of such investments potentially being made in advance of an approval. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial position and working capital.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop or acquire and eventually commercialize a product with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001), obtaining marketing approval for itolizumab (EQ001), manufacturing, marketing and selling itolizumab (EQ001) if we obtain marketing approval, and satisfying post-marketing requirements, if any. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we succeed in obtaining approval for and commercializing itolizumab (EQ001), we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. In addition, as a young business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown challenges. Furthermore, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we may continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will require substantial additional funding to complete the development and any commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001) and our other product candidates. If we are unable to raise this capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or other operations.\nWe expect our expenses to increase substantially during the next few years. The development of biotechnology product candidates is capital intensive. As we conduct non-clinical research and clinical development of our product candidates, we will need substantial additional funds to maintain and expand our capabilities in a variety of areas including research, clinical development, regulatory affairs, product quality assurance, and pharmacovigilance. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for marketing, sales, manufacturing and distribution. Some of those commercialization investments may be made at-risk in advance of receiving an approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $80.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, will enable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, changing circumstances or inaccurate estimates by us may cause us to use capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. For example, our ongoing and future clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) may encounter technical, enrollment or other issues that could cause our development costs to increase more than we expect. We do not have sufficient funds to complete the clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001) through regulatory approval for our current indications, and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001).\nFuture capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of our ongoing and future clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001), including as such activities may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics;\n\u2022the number and scope of indications we decide to pursue for itolizumab (EQ001) development;\n\u2022the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of any BLA we may submit for itolizumab (EQ001);\n\u2022the costs and timing of manufacturing for itolizumab (EQ001), if approved;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of itolizumab (EQ001);\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and\n\u2022the cost associated with commercializing itolizumab (EQ001), if approved for commercial sale.\nIn July 2020, we entered into an at-the-market facility with Jefferies, or the 2020 ATM Facility, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million from time to time through Jefferies acting as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2021, we sold an aggregate of 788,685 shares of our common stock under the 2020 ATM Facility for gross proceeds of $10.4 million. There have been no sales of shares of our common stock under the 2020 ATM Facility since December 31, 2021 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, with Lincoln Park which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 65,374 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions contained within the Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nIn February 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors, whereby we sold 4,285,710 shares of common stock and issued warrants to purchase 1,285,713 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $30.0 million. The warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance at an initial exercise price of $14.00 per share and are exercisable on a cashless basis. The warrants expire on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of issuance or (ii) the 15th calendar date following the date on which we close upon an equity financing that results in not less than $25 million of gross proceeds to us at a price per share of common stock equal to or greater than $25.00, at which time, all remaining warrants will automatically exercise on a cashless basis.\nOur commercial revenues, if any, are expected to be primarily derived from sales of products, which is unlikely to happen within the next 12 months, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to rapidly evolve and have already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and conflict between Russia and Ukraine. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital. Subject to limited exceptions, we are prohibited from incurring indebtedness without the prior written consent of the lenders pursuant to the loan agreement we entered into with Oxford Finance LLC and Silicon Valley in September 2019, as amended in December 2020, April 2021 and February 2022, or the Loan Agreement. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or other operations.\nThe terms of our Loan Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the Loan Agreement providing for up to $20.0 million in term loans, which is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our current and future assets, other than our intellectual property (except rights to payment from the sale, licensing or disposition of such intellectual property). We borrowed $10.0 million upon execution of the Loan Agreement. The availability of any further credit from this Loan Agreement beyond that initial $10.0 million advancement has lapsed.\nThe Loan Agreement includes affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants regarding delivery of financial statements, maintenance of inventory, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance, protection of intellectual property rights, dispositions of property, business combinations or acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness or liens, investments and transactions with affiliates, among other customary covenants. We are also restricted from paying dividends or making other distributions or payments on our capital stock, subject to limited exceptions.\nThe Loan Agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Oxford Finance LLC, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loans under the Loan Agreement, including foreclosure against our properties securing the Loan Agreement, including our cash, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to satisfy our payment obligations under the Loan Agreement, the breach of certain of our other covenants under the Loan Agreement, or the occurrence of a material adverse change, cross defaults to other indebtedness or material agreements, judgment defaults and defaults related to failure to maintain governmental approvals failure of which to maintain could result in a material adverse effect. Further, if we are liquidated, the lenders\u2019 right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. The lenders could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse change as defined under the Loan Agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by the lenders of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Itolizumab (EQ001)\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our product candidate, itolizumab (EQ001), which is in clinical development, and we may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize, this product candidate in any of the indications for which we plan to develop it.\nOur future success will depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize itolizumab (EQ001), in any of the indications for which we initially plan to develop it, including treatment of aGVHD, lupus nephritis and uncontrolled asthma, which may never occur. We currently generate no revenues\nfrom sales of any biopharmaceutical products or otherwise, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable biopharmaceutical product.\nBefore we can market and sell itolizumab (EQ001) in the United States, we will need to manage research and development activities, commence and complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and build a commercial organization or enter into a marketing collaboration with a third party, among other things. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approval and develop sufficient commercial capabilities for itolizumab (EQ001). We have not submitted a BLA to the FDA for any product candidate. Further, itolizumab (EQ001) may not receive regulatory approval even if it is successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of itolizumab (EQ001). If itolizumab (EQ001) is approved and we fail to successfully commercialize it, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nItolizumab (EQ001) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets CD6, a target for which there are no FDA-approved therapies. This makes it difficult to predict the timing and costs of clinical development for itolizumab (EQ001). We do not know whether our approach in targeting CD6 will allow us to develop any products of commercial value.\nWe have concentrated our research and development approach on targeting CD6, and our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach to the diseases we are targeting for treatment. To date, there are no FDA-approved drugs that target CD6, and while there are a number of independent studies clinically validating CD6 as a target, other than our partner Biocon, CD6 has not traditionally been a pathway targeted by other biopharmaceutical companies. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied therapeutic approaches. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring itolizumab (EQ001) to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business.\nAdditionally, companion diagnostic tests may be developed for use with itolizumab (EQ001). We, or our collaborators, will be required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for these tests, as well as coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the approval and coverage and reimbursement we seek for our itolizumab (EQ001). Our inability to collaborate with a companion diagnostics developer could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have licensed the rights to itolizumab in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Any adverse developments that occur during any research, clinical, or commercial use of itolizumab by Biocon or third parties in other jurisdictions may affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nBiocon, its Cuban partner, CIMAB, S.A., and their licensees, over which we have no control, have the rights to develop itolizumab worldwide and commercialize itolizumab in geographies outside of the Equillium Territory. Itolizumab is approved in India for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and is marketed by Biocon as ALZUMAb. Biocon was also granted restricted emergency use approval of itolizumab by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in India. In September 2020, the DCGI granted approval of itolizumab produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, marketed in India under the brand name ALZUMAb-L, or ALZUMAb Lyophilized, for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, as well as restricted emergency use authorization for the treatment of CRS in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. We are also aware that ALZUMAb and ALZUMAb-L have been and may continue to be used in India on a compassionate use basis, off label, and/or in investigator-initiated studies.\nWe are aware of one currently active clinical study of itolizumab being conducted in Cuba in subjects with COVID-19, as well as other completed or inactive clinical studies in Cuba in Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Centro de Immunologia Molecular was granted regulatory approval in Cuba for itolizumab to be used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis as well as emergency use approval in patients with COVID-19.\nThe results of clinical studies with itolizumab conducted by Biocon or third parties as well as the ongoing adverse event reporting related to the clinical or commercial use of itolizumab supported by Biocon or third parties could impact our development plans and the potential commercial prospects for itolizumab (EQ001). Further, we do not control and are unable to validate study results reported by Biocon or third parties. Any errors or omissions in the data and public disclosures reported by Biocon or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and business plans.\nIf serious adverse events occur with patients using itolizumab as an approved therapy or during any clinical trials, exploratory studies, or other clinical uses of itolizumab conducted or supported by Biocon or third parties, regulatory authorities, including the FDA, may delay, limit or deny approval of itolizumab (EQ001), suspend our clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001), or require us to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition of marketing approval, which would increase our costs and adversely impact our business. If we receive regulatory approval for itolizumab (EQ001) and a new and serious safety issue is identified in connection with the commercial use of ALZUMAb or ALZUMAb-L or in clinical trials, exploratory studies, or other clinical uses of itolizumab conducted or supported by Biocon or third parties, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or otherwise restrict our ability to market and sell itolizumab. In addition, treating physicians may be less willing to administer our product due to concerns over such adverse events, which would limit our ability to commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) and could potentially adversely impact our ability to conduct clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001).\nWe have limited experience in clinical development and have not successfully completed late-stage clinical trials or obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate.\nWe initiated our first clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of aGVHD in the first quarter of 2019, our second clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma in the second quarter of 2019 and our third clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of lupus nephritis in the third quarter of 2019. In March 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 pivotal clinical study of itolizumab (EQ001) in patients with aGVHD. We have three active INDs with the FDA for the use of itolizumab (EQ001) in the treatment of aGVHD, lupus nephritis, and COVID-19 patients, and we have not filed an IND with the FDA for the use of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma. Because of our limited interaction with the FDA, we may not learn of certain information or data that the FDA may request until future interactions. In part because of our limited infrastructure, experience conducting clinical trials as a company and regulatory interactions, we also cannot be certain that our ongoing and future clinical trials will be completed on time, if at all, that our planned clinical trials will be initiated on time, if at all, or that our planned development programs would be acceptable to the FDA.\nAdverse safety and toxicology findings may emerge as we conduct non-clinical research or clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, because later-stage clinical trials may be conducted in broader patient populations and involve different study designs. For example, although itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb share the same primary monoclonal antibody sequence, they are manufactured in different cell lines and thus could be considered different biopharmaceutical products. Therefore, results seen in clinical trials of ALZUMAb conducted by Biocon may not be predictive of the results of our clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001). Furthermore, our future clinical trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in larger patient populations for approval by the FDA. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. In addition, only a small percentage of biologics under development result in the submission of a BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend heavily on our ability to successfully complete the above activities and any other activities required for the successful development and eventual commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001). The success of itolizumab (EQ001) will further depend on factors such as:\n\u2022completion of our ongoing and future clinical trials and preclinical studies with favorable results, including activities that may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022acceptance of INDs by the FDA for our future clinical trials, as applicable;\n\u2022timely and successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials with favorable results;\n\u2022demonstrating safety, efficacy and acceptable risk-benefit profile of itolizumab (EQ001) to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u2022receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA;\n\u2022maintaining arrangements with Biocon, our manufacturer of itolizumab (EQ001), for cell lines and drug product clinical supply and, if and when approved, for commercial supply of itolizumab (EQ001);\n\u2022establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sale of itolizumab (EQ001), if and when approved in one or more indications;\n\u2022acceptance of itolizumab (EQ001), if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for itolizumab (EQ001); and\n\u2022maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of itolizumab (EQ001), following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully obtain marketing approval and commercialize itolizumab (EQ001), which would materially harm our business.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire other medicine candidates or medicines, our business and prospects would be limited.\nOne element of our strategy is to expand our pipeline by acquiring a portfolio of other product candidates in addition to itolizumab (EQ001), through business or product candidate acquisitions such as our acquisition of Bioniz. The success of this strategy depends in large part upon the combination of our regulatory, development and commercial capabilities and expertise and our ability to identify, select and acquire product candidates for therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current pipeline, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us. Identifying, selecting and acquiring promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or license of a particular drug candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to identify, select and acquire suitable drug candidates from third parties or acquire businesses at valuations and on other terms acceptable to us, or if we are unable to raise capital required to acquire businesses or new medicines, our business and prospects will be limited.\nMoreover, any product candidate we acquire may require additional, time-consuming development or regulatory efforts prior to commercial sale or prior to expansion into other indications, including pre-clinical studies if applicable, and extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risk of failure that is inherent in pharmaceutical drug development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective or desired than other commercially available alternatives.\nIn addition, if we fail to successfully commercialize and further develop our product candidates, there is a greater likelihood that we will fail to successfully develop a pipeline of other product candidates to follow our existing medicines or be able to acquire other product candidates to expand our existing portfolio, and our business and prospects would be harmed.\nPotential natural disasters, some possibly related to the increasing effects of climate change, could damage or destroy clinical trial sites, our office spaces, laboratories, and/or warehouses, which could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nWe are vulnerable to the increasing impact of climate change and other natural disasters. Volatile changes in weather conditions, including extreme heat or cold, could increase the risk of wildfires, floods, blizzards, hurricanes and other weather-related disasters. Such extreme weather events, or other natural disasters such as earthquakes, can cause power outages and network disruptions that may result in disruption to operations and may impact our ability to continue or complete our clinical trials, which will negatively impact our operations and delay our plans to commercialize our product candidates. They could also cause significant damage to or destruction of our clinical trial sites resulting in temporary or long-term closures of these facilities. Such disasters could also result in loss or damage to office buildings, laboratories, employee and/or patient homes, employees and/or patients relocating to other parts of the country or being unwilling to travel to the clinical trial site locations, and the inability to recruit key employees and/or enroll patients. This could result in adverse impacts to the available workforce and/or patient samples, damage to or destruction of materials and/or data, or the inability to conduct clinical trials and deliver new data.\nWe have licensed itolizumab from Biocon pursuant to an exclusive license agreement, which license is conditioned upon us meeting certain diligence obligations with respect to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of\nitolizumab, and making significant milestone payments in connection with regulatory approval and commercial milestones as well as royalty payments.\nWe are party to an exclusive license agreement with Biocon, pursuant to which we initially acquired an exclusive license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit itolizumab and any pharmaceutical composition or preparation containing or comprising itolizumab in the United States and Canada and which was later amended to grant us the same exclusive license in Australia and New Zealand as well, or, collectively, the Equillium Territory. We are obligated, under this agreement, to achieve certain development milestones within specified timeframes in order to retain all of the licensed rights. Certain of such milestones are largely outside of our control. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for, and if regulatory approval is obtained, to commercialize, itolizumab in the Equillium Territory and to secure funding for the development of itolizumab in two or more indications. Further, we are obligated to make certain cash milestone payments to Biocon upon completion of certain regulatory approval and commercial milestones and are required to pay royalties to Biocon on net sales of itolizumab, if approved. Though we believe that the royalty rates and milestone payments are reasonable in light of our business plan, we will require large amounts of capital to satisfy these obligations. We may become obligated to make a milestone payment when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. In addition, if we are unable to make any payment when due or, if we fail to achieve the development milestones within the timeframes required by the license agreement, or to satisfy our general diligence obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, register and commercialize itolizumab and to secure funding for the development of itolizumab in two or more indications, Biocon may have the right to limit the scope of our license or terminate the agreement and all of our rights to develop and commercialize itolizumab.\nThe development and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation, and we may not obtain regulatory approvals for itolizumab (EQ001) in any of the indications for which we plan to develop it, or any future product candidates, on a timely basis or at all.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing, distribution, adverse event reporting, including the submission of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, and other possible activities relating to itolizumab (EQ001), currently our only product candidate, as well as any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, are subject to extensive regulation. Marketing approval of biologics in the United States requires the submission of a BLA to the FDA and we are not permitted to market any product candidate in the United States until we obtain approval from the FDA of the BLA for that product. A BLA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls.\nFDA approval of a BLA is not guaranteed, and the review and approval process is an expensive and uncertain process that may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for BLA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to treat and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Despite the time and expense associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials, failure can occur at any stage. The results of preclinical and early clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates may not be predictive of the results of our later-stage clinical trials.\nClinical trial failure may result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect, patient enrollment criteria and failure to demonstrate favorable safety or efficacy traits, and failure in clinical trials can occur at any stage. Companies in the biopharmaceutical industry frequently suffer setbacks in the advancement of clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. In addition, data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may further delay, limit or prevent marketing approval.\nThe FDA could delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they:\n\u2022may not deem our product candidate to be adequately safe and effective;\n\u2022may not agree that the data collected from clinical trials are acceptable or sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval, and may impose requirements for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022may determine that adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials represents an unacceptable level of risk;\n\u2022may determine that population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u2022may not accept clinical data from trials, which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;\n\u2022may disagree regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications;\n\u2022may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with our product candidate;\n\u2022may change approval policies or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022may not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nGenerally, public concern regarding the safety of biopharmaceutical products could delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval, result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling, or require us to undertake other activities that may entail additional costs. We have not obtained FDA approval for any product. This lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, if at all, for itolizumab (EQ001).\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of itolizumab (EQ001), our commercial prospects will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny delays in the commencement or completion, or termination or suspension, of our ongoing, planned or future clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to raise capital or generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nAny delays in the commencement or completion, or termination or suspension, of our ongoing, planned or future clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects. Before we can initiate clinical trials of our product candidates in any distinct indication, we must submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA along with other information, including information about their chemistry, manufacturing and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol, as part of an IND or similar regulatory filing. To date, we have only submitted INDs for clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of aGVHD, lupus nephritis, and COVID-19. In addition, there are open INDs for EQ101 in HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, CTCL and alopecia areata, which were originally filed by Bioniz prior to our acquisition of the EQ101 asset.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from the FDA for the sale of any of our product candidates in any indication, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of those product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. In addition, we expect to rely in part on preclinical, clinical and quality data generated by our partner, Biocon, as well as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other contracted parties for regulatory submissions for our product candidates. While we have or will have agreements governing these contracted parties\u2019 services, we have limited influence over their actual performance. If these parties do not make data available to us, or, if applicable, make regulatory submissions in a timely manner, in each case pursuant to our agreements with them, our development programs may be significantly delayed and we may need to conduct additional studies or collect additional data independently. In either case, our development costs would increase.\nThe FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies of our existing or any future product candidates before it allows us to initiate clinical trials under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development programs. Any such delays in the commencement or completion of our ongoing, planned or future clinical trials could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether our ongoing and future trials will be completed on schedule, if at all, or whether our trials will begin on time, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022impacts and risks associated with global health epidemics such as those related to COVID-19 (for example, in March 2020, as a result of impacts and risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to pause enrollment in our Phase 1b clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) in uncontrolled asthma and lupus nephritis), which enrollment was resumed in July 2020);\n\u2022the FDA disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022obtaining FDA authorizations to commence a trial or reaching a consensus with the FDA on trial design;\n\u2022any failure or delay in reaching an agreement with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022obtaining approval from one or more institutional review boards, or IRBs;\n\u2022additional nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies to support Phase 2 and 3 trials;\n\u2022IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing their approval of the trial;\n\u2022changes to clinical trial protocol;\n\u2022clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate or obtaining sufficient quantities of combination therapies for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022subjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect, or failing to return for post-treatment follow-up. As a result of impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed slower-than-expected enrollment rates in our clinical trials;\n\u2022subjects choosing an alternative treatment, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n\u2022subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u2022occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies;\n\u2022selection of clinical end points that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u2022a facility manufacturing our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA (or its own regulatory authorities if such facility is located outside the United States) to temporarily or permanently shut down or cease export of such materials due to violations of current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations or other applicable requirements, changes in export restrictions and controls, or infections or cross-contaminations during the manufacturing process;\n\u2022any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u2022third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or GCP, or other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022us, or our contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner or improperly disclosing data prematurely or otherwise in violation of a clinical trial protocol; or\n\u2022our contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or by other regulatory agencies or health authorities that have jurisdiction in countries in which the trial is being conducted. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory agencies resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a pharmaceutical, changes in governmental regulations or administrative\nactions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to comply with these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nCertain of our scientific advisors or consultants who receive compensation from us are likely to be investigators for our future clinical trials. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory agencies. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory agencies and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of itolizumab (EQ001) in one or more indications. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001), the commercial prospects of itolizumab (EQ001) will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Moreover, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approval could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to continue our ongoing or initiate our future clinical trials for itolizumab (EQ001) if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA. Multiple factors could contribute to such challenges of enrolling our clinical trials, including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have already adversely impacted enrollment across all three of our current clinical trials. In particular, enrollment in our Phase 1b clinical trial in uncontrolled asthma was slower-than-expected due to disruptions to operations at clinical trial sites in Australia related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as due to patients\u2019 high-risk status for COVID-19 and a decrease in asthma exacerbations as a result of stay-at-home and social distancing measures. In addition, some of our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as itolizumab (EQ001), and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. This is acutely relevant for our development of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma and lupus nephritis, each diseases for which there is significant competition for clinical trial subjects. Patient enrollment is also affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022impacts and risks associated with global health epidemics such as those related to COVID-19;\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators of appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022invasive procedures required to obtain evidence of the product candidate\u2019s performance during the clinical trial;\n\u2022availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation;\n\u2022eligibility criteria defined in the protocol for the trial in question;\n\u2022the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022reluctance of physicians to encourage patient participation in clinical trials;\n\u2022the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll and retain a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in\nincreased development costs, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe novel coronavirus global pandemic has adversely impacted our business, including our clinical trials, and could further impact other aspects of our business including our supply chain, personnel, and our business development activities, the magnitude and extent of which are uncertain\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, designated COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China and has since become a global pandemic. The President of the United States declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency and many states and municipalities in the United States, including California, have announced aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). As a result, we have implemented work-from-home policies for employees and have moved to a \u201cvirtual\u201d model with respect to our partner support activities. The effects of government actions and our policies and those of third parties to reduce the spread of the coronavirus may negatively impact productivity, cause disruptions to our supply chain and ongoing and future clinical trials and impair our ability to execute our business development strategy. These and other disruptions in our operations and the global economy could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to the coronavirus or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for our clinical trials. In particular, certain of our service providers involved in clinical trials are located in regions that have been subject to coronavirus-related actions and policies that limit the conduct of normal business operations. To the extent our suppliers and service providers are unable to comply with their obligations under our agreements with them or they are otherwise unable to deliver or are delayed in delivering goods and services to us due to the coronavirus, our ability to continue advancing development of our product candidates may become impaired.\nIn addition, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the coronavirus. In March 2020, as a result of impacts and risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to pause enrollment in our Phase 1b clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) in uncontrolled asthma and lupus nephritis. This decision was not based on any observed safety issues associated with itolizumab (EQ001) but rather out of an abundance of caution related to the current global pandemic and our concern for the well-being of patients and their caregivers. In July 2020, we announced that patient enrollment in both of those trials had resumed. We did not pause enrollment of patients in the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of aGVHD given the acute life-threatening severity of the disease as we believe itolizumab (EQ001) represents a potentially life-saving treatment for these severely ill patients. However, there remains a significant risk that enrollment of all of our active clinical trials and the timing of data from those trials may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment in our current and future clinical trials may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the coronavirus. Patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may also choose to not enroll, not participate in follow-up clinical visits or drop out of the trial as a precaution against contracting the coronavirus. Further, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to the coronavirus, may be adversely impacted. These events could delay our clinical trials, increase the cost of completing our clinical trials and negatively impact the integrity, reliability or robustness of the data from our clinical trials.\nThe spread of the coronavirus and actions taken to reduce its spread may also materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the coronavirus may be difficult to assess or predict, there could be a significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and financial position.\nDespite recent progress in the administration of vaccines, the extent to which the outbreak of recent variants, including Delta and Omicron, and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe, may impact our clinical trials, our supply chain, our access to capital and our business development activities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the efforts by governments and business to contain it, business closures or business disruptions and the impact on the economy and capital markets.\nAdverse side effects or other safety risks associated with our product candidates could delay or preclude approval, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon further development, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nAs is the case with pharmaceuticals generally, it is likely that there may be side effects and adverse events associated with our product candidates in our ongoing and future clinical trials as well as in clinical trials, investigator-initiated studies, or off-label usage in jurisdictions where itolizumab is available commercially.\nBased on our current limited clinical experience with itolizumab (EQ001), expected adverse events include lymphopenia, injection site reactions, infusion-/injection-related reactions (including fever and headache), and other systemic hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, erythema, and pruritus.\nThe most common adverse drug reactions that have been identified from the itolizumab (EQ001) clinical programs were injection site reactions (designated an identified risk) with subcutaneous administration and lymphopenia (designated an important identified risk). Additionally, infection has been designated as an important potential risk. Lymphopenia events were common treatment emergent adverse events reported across itolizumab (EQ001) studies. A decrease in lymphocyte count is a known pharmacodynamic marker of itolizumab (EQ001). These events were generally transient following the first dose, did not decline with continued dosing, and resolved when itolizumab (EQ001) treatment was withdrawn. Further, the declines in lymphocyte count were not associated with infection or other clinical sequelae.\nBiocon may also continue to support the use of ALZUMAb or ALZUMAb-L in their own sponsored clinical trials, off-label use, investigator-initiated trials, or third party-sponsored trials over which we have no control. Given such ongoing usage of itolizumab by Biocon or third parties, there is a risk that adverse events may impact our ability to conduct clinical development and successfully commercialize itolizumab (EQ001). Further, there is a risk that any such adverse events are not properly reported, which may also adversely impact our business.\nAlthough itolizumab (EQ001) and ALZUMAb share the same primary monoclonal antibody sequence, they are manufactured in different cell lines and thus could be considered different biopharmaceutical products. Therefore, clinical results seen with ALZUMAb may have no bearing on results, including adverse events, that may be seen with itolizumab (EQ001). Through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any meaningful change in the benefit-to-risk profile of itolizumab.\nResults of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials by us or the FDA for a number of reasons. Additionally, a material percentage of patients in our ongoing aGVHD clinical trial may die from this disease, possibly as a result of itolizumab (EQ001), which could impact development of itolizumab (EQ001). If we elect or are required to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from this product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Serious adverse events observed in clinical trials could hinder or prevent market acceptance of our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly.\nMoreover, if any of our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may elect to abandon or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, which may limit the commercial expectations for our product candidates, if approved. We may also be required to modify our study plans based on findings in our clinical trials. Many product candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development. In addition, regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations.\nIt is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, including with different dosing regimens, or as the use of our product candidates becomes more widespread following any regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by that approved product or any related products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approval of the approved product;\n\u2022we may be required to recall a product or change the way the approved product is administered to patients;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication, or issue safety alerts, \"Dear Healthcare Provider\" letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\u2022we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing or promotion of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022the approved product could become less competitive; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any of our product candidates, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterim, topline or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses, or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular biopharmaceutical product, biopharmaceutical product candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nIn the past, we have conducted clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) outside of the United States, and we plan to utilize sites outside of the United States for other clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001), including our Phase 3 pivotal study in aGVHD, as well as possibly for clinical trials of our other product candidates. The FDA may not accept data from such trials, in which case our development plans will be delayed, which could materially harm our business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Biocon completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) in healthy subjects in Australia to assess the safety and tolerability of the subcutaneous version of itolizumab (EQ001). The trial also included a separate stage to compare the pharmacokinetics of the intravenous administration of itolizumab (EQ001) to ALZUMAb and determine the absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous itolizumab (EQ001), but this stage was terminated early due to the occurrence of an initial decrease in lymphocyte counts and transient lymphopenia. We submitted this data to the FDA as part\nof our IND submissions for the conduct of clinical trials for the treatment of aGVHD and lupus nephritis. However, it is possible that the FDA will not authorize us to proceed with clinical studies in connection with any future IND submissions in other indications that have different patient populations and we may be required to conduct additional Phase 1 clinical trials, which would be costly and time consuming, and delay aspects of our development plan, which could harm our business.\nWe conducted a Phase 1b, multiple ascending dose, clinical trial of itolizumab (EQ001) in uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma at sites in Australia and New Zealand. Also, we plan to utilize sites outside of the United States in our Phase 3 pivotal study in aGVHD, as well as potentially in our clinical studies of our other product candidates. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted entirely outside the United States and not under an IND, acceptance of such study data is generally subject to certain conditions. For example, the FDA requires the clinical trial to have been conducted in accordance with GCPs, and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. In addition, when studies are conducted only at sites outside of the United States, the FDA generally does not provide advance comment on the clinical protocols for the studies, and therefore there is an additional potential risk that the FDA could determine that the study design or protocol for a non-U.S. clinical trial was inadequate, which would likely require us to conduct additional clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials outside the United States also exposes us to additional risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022additional foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022foreign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022compliance with foreign manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements;\n\u2022cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and\n\u2022diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to expand our pipeline by identifying additional indications for which to test itolizumab (EQ001) in the future. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular indication for itolizumab (EQ001) and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nOur translational biology program may initially show promise in identifying additional indications for which itolizumab (EQ001) may have therapeutic benefit, yet this may fail to yield additional clinical development opportunities for itolizumab (EQ001) for a number of reasons, including, itolizumab (EQ001) may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects, limited to no efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that it is unlikely to receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance in such additional indications. Research programs to identify additional indications for itolizumab (EQ001) require substantial technical, financial and human resources.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must prioritize our research programs and will need to focus itolizumab (EQ001) development on the potential treatment of certain indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other indications or for any future product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on itolizumab (EQ001) for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidate, we may pursue indications that are less attractive and may also relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA approves any product candidate, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and record keeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, which can be costly and time consuming. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports,\nregistration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. We must incur significant expenses and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, undesirable side effects caused by the product, problems encountered by our contracted manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, either before or after product approval, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;\n\u2022requirements to include additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022requirements to create a medication guide outlining the risks to patients;\n\u2022withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022requirements to change the way the product is administered or for us to conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u2022harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, if any product candidate receives marketing approval, the FDA could require us to adopt a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the therapy outweigh its risks, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the product or the particular product candidate at issue and could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we have any product candidate approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about biopharmaceutical products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if our product candidates receive marketing approval in any indication, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf itolizumab (EQ001) or any of our product candidates receives marketing approval in any one or more indication, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If they do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance, if approved for commercial sale in any indication, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022our ability to offer the approved product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022potential product liability claims;\n\u2022the timing of market introduction as well as competitive biopharmaceutical products;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our or any of our potential future sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022unfavorable publicity;\n\u2022sufficient third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay all, or a portion of, out-of-pocket costs associated with our products in the absence of sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, and we may have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with contracted third parties to market and sell itolizumab (EQ001) or any other approved products, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities, nor have we commercialized a product. If any of our product candidates ultimately receives regulatory approval, we may not be able to effectively market and distribute it. We may have to seek collaborators or invest significant amounts of financial and management resources to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that itolizumab (EQ001) or any of our product candidates will be approved, if at all. We may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms, or at all. In addition, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, may be lower if we rely on contracted parties for these functions than if we were to market, sell and distribute our products ourselves. We likely will have limited control over such contracted parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. Even if we determine to perform sales, marketing and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional related risks, including:\n\u2022we may not be able to attract and build an effective marketing department or sales force;\n\u2022the cost of establishing a marketing department or sales force may exceed our available financial resources and the revenue generated by any approved product candidates; and\n\u2022our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products more quickly or marketing them more successfully than us. If their product candidates are shown to be safer or more effective than ours, then our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop drugs and biologics for the treatment of immuno-inflammatory diseases. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop, or that would render any products that we may develop obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nWe are aware that other products addressing the same indications as itolizumab (EQ001), EQ101 and EQ102 are in development, and some have been approved. With regards to aGVHD, we are aware of both private and public companies with development programs, including CSL Behring LLC, ElsaLys Biotech, Xenikos B.V., Humanigen, Inc., Maat Pharma SA and AltruBio, Inc., and that Incyte has an approved product in steroid-refractory aGVHD. We are aware of a number of public companies with development programs targeting lupus nephritis including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Genentech Inc., Kezar Life Sciences, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Omeros Corporation, and that both Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline plc have approved products in this indication. There are no approved products for alopecia areata or celiac disease. Private and public companies involved in alopecia areata drug development include Concert Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer Inc., Reistone Biopharma and Arena Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Pfizer in 2022). Private and public companies with development programs targeting celiac disease, include 9 Meters Biopharma, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Zedira, Provention Bio, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Selecta Biosciences and ImmunogenX.\nMany of our competitors, such as large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies like Amgen Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we have. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. In addition, these larger companies may be able to use their greater market power to obtain more favorable distribution and sales-related agreements with third parties, which could give them a competitive advantage over us.\nFurther, as more product candidates within a particular class of biopharmaceutical products proceed through clinical development to regulatory review and approval, the amount and type of clinical data that may be required by regulatory authorities may increase or change. Consequently, the results of our clinical trials for product candidates in those classes will likely need to show a risk benefit profile that is competitive with or more favorable than those products and product candidates in order to obtain marketing approval or, if approved, a product label that is favorable for commercialization. If the risk benefit profile is not competitive with those products or product candidates, we may have developed a product that is not commercially viable, that we are not able to sell profitably or that is unable to achieve favorable pricing or reimbursement. In such circumstances, our future product revenues and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, itolizumab (EQ001) or any future programs.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of itolizumab (EQ001) are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement. If we are not successful in developing, commercializing and achieving higher levels of reimbursement than our competitors, we will not be able to compete against them and our business would be materially harmed.\nItolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA\nuntil four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf the U.S. market opportunities for itolizumab (EQ001) are smaller than we believe they are, our potential revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe only have the rights to itolizumab (EQ001) for the Equillium Territory, and we are focused on the development of itolizumab (EQ001) for immuno-inflammatory diseases, with an initial intention to develop it for the treatment of patients with aGVHD, lupus nephritis and uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma. Our projections of addressable patient populations in the Equillium Territory that have the potential to benefit from treatment with itolizumab (EQ001) are based on estimates and may prove to be incorrect. If any of our estimates are inaccurate, the market opportunities for itolizumab (EQ001) could be significantly diminished and have an adverse material impact on our business.\nWe may not ultimately realize the potential benefits of orphan drug designation for itolizumab (EQ001).\nWe received orphan drug designations for itolizumab (EQ001) for both the prevention and treatment of aGVHD. The FDA grants orphan designation to drugs that are intended to treat rare diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States or that affect more than 200,000 persons but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug. Orphan drugs do not require prescription drug user fees with a marketing application, may qualify the drug development sponsor for certain tax credits, and may be eligible for a market exclusivity period of seven years (with certain exceptions). However, orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time nor regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Even if we are awarded marketing exclusivity, the FDA can still approve another drug containing the same active ingredient and used for the same orphan indication if it determines that a subsequent drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care, and orphan exclusivity can be lost if the orphan drug manufacturer is unable to assure that a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug is available to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the initial request for designation was materially defective. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving competing drugs for the same or similar indication containing a different active ingredient. If orphan drug exclusivity is lost and we were unable to successfully enforce any remaining patents covering our eligible product candidates, we could be subject to biosimilar competition earlier than we anticipate. In addition, if a subsequent drug is approved for marketing for the same or a similar indication as itolizumab (EQ001), we may face increased competition and lose market share regardless of orphan drug exclusivity.\nFast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe have received fast track designation for itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of aGVHD and lupus nephritis. If a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. Even with fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nEven if we receive marketing approval, we may not be able to successfully commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) due to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could make it difficult for us to sell itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates profitably.\nObtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of itolizumab (EQ001) or other future products to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors, by any future laws limiting pharmaceutical prices and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. One third-party payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Obtaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded therapeutics and therapeutics administered under the supervision of a physician. Similarly, because our product candidates are physician-administered injectables, separate reimbursement for the product itself may or may not be available. Instead, the administering physician may be reimbursed for providing the treatment or procedure in which our product is used. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, and the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy and on what tier of its list of covered drugs, or formulary, it will be placed. The position on a third-party payor\u2019s formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product\nacceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Additionally, if we or our collaborators develop companion diagnostic tests for use with itolizumab (EQ001), such tests will be subject to the coverage and reimbursement process separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our itolizumab (EQ001).\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the successful commercialization of new products. Further, the adoption and implementation of any future governmental cost containment or other health reform initiative may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties\nThe manufacture of biologics is complex and Biocon, our exclusive manufacturer of itolizumab, may encounter difficulties in production, distribution and delivery of itolizumab. If Biocon encounters such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of itolizumab (EQ001) for clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval, or our ability to obtain commercial supply of our products, if approved, could be delayed or stopped.\nWe have no experience in biologic manufacturing and do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We are completely dependent on Biocon to fulfill our clinical and commercial supply of itolizumab (EQ001). In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive clinical supply agreement with Biocon and have agreed to enter into an exclusive commercial supply agreement with Biocon in the future. Biocon manufactures itolizumab (EQ001) at its FDA regulated facility in Bangalore, India. However, the process of manufacturing biologics is complex, highly-regulated and subject to multiple risks. Manufacturing biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions and higher costs. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered at the facilities of our manufacturer, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials, result in higher costs of drug product and adversely harm our business. In addition, if the facilities of our manufacturer are located outside of the United States, as is the case for itolizumab (EQ001), the production, distribution and delivery of biologics is also subject to the laws and regulations of the country. Any changes in the laws and regulations of another country could delay clinical trials, result in higher costs of drug product and adversely harm our business. Moreover, if the FDA determines that our manufacturer is not in compliance with FDA laws and regulations, including those governing cGMPs, the FDA may deny BLA approval until the deficiencies are corrected or we replace the manufacturer in our BLA with a manufacturer that is in compliance.\nIn addition, there are risks associated with large scale manufacturing for clinical trials or commercial scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with cGMPs, lot consistency and timely availability and delivery of raw materials. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates, there is no assurance that Biocon or other potential manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. Further, our contracted manufacturers may experience manufacturing or shipping difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of natural disasters, labor disputes, unstable political environments, or public health epidemics such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization, commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nScaling up a biologic manufacturing process is a difficult and uncertain task, and Biocon may not have the necessary capabilities to complete the implementation and development process of further scaling up production, transferring production to other sites, or managing its production capacity to timely deliver our supplies of itolizumab (EQ001) (or other biologics) or meet product demand. For example, in March 2020, due to the spread of the coronavirus, the Indian government restricted the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them. These export restrictions are indefinite and may be expanded. If the export restrictions are expanded to include itolizumab (EQ001), our supply of itolizumab (EQ001) may be disrupted, delayed or stopped indefinitely and our ability to continue development of itolizumab (EQ001), including our ongoing clinical trials, may be significantly impacted and may result in higher costs of drug product\nand adversely harm our business. If Biocon is unable to meet our manufacturing requirements (due to export restrictions or otherwise), it has the discretion to outsource manufacturing to a third party and the joint steering committee may determine to shift manufacturing to a third party. However, transfer of the manufacturing of biologic products to a new contract manufacturer can be lengthy and involve significant additional costs. Even if we are able to adequately validate and scale-up the manufacturing process for itolizumab (EQ001) with a contract manufacturer, we will still need to negotiate with such contract manufacturer an agreement for commercial supply and it is not certain we will be able to come to agreement on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, Biocon has certain rights to reacquire exclusive manufacturing rights for itolizumab (EQ001), even after a third party has been engaged following shortfalls by Biocon, which will may make it difficult and expensive to engage any third party manufacturer for itolizumab (EQ001) other than Biocon.\nWe rely, and intend to continue to rely, on contracted research organizations (CROs) to conduct our clinical trials and perform some of our research and preclinical studies. If these third parties do not satisfactorily carry out their contractual duties, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, our development programs may be delayed or subject to increased costs or we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval, each of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. As a result, we are and will be dependent on third parties to conduct our ongoing and future clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001) and preclinical studies, and any future preclinical studies and clinical trials of any other product candidates. The timing of the initiation and completion of these trials will therefore be partially controlled by such third parties and may result in delays to our development programs. Specifically, we expect CROs, clinical investigators and consultants to play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, we will not be able to control all aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each clinical trial is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs and other third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical trial investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or any of our CROs or clinical trial sites fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to stop and/or repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process.\nThere is no guarantee that any such CROs, clinical trial investigators or other third parties on which we rely will devote adequate time and resources to our development activities or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, adhere to our clinical protocols or meet regulatory requirements, otherwise performs in a substandard manner, or terminates its engagement with us, the timelines for our development programs may be extended or delayed or our development activities may be suspended or terminated. If our clinical trial site terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in such clinical trial unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site, which may be difficult or impossible. In addition, clinical trial investigators for our clinical trial may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of any marketing application we submit by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other biopharmaceutical product development activities that could harm our competitive position. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products.\nOur reliance on contracted parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on contracted parties to research, develop, and manufacture our product candidates, we must share trade secrets with them. The need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets\nbecome known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of confidentiality agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s independent discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAgreements with our advisors, employees, contractors and consultants may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with will likely expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration and any joint research and development programs may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements, independent development or publication of information by any of our collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may wish to acquire rights to future assets through in-licensing or may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to future product candidates, but may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter or delay our development and commercialization plans.\nThe development and potential commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates will require substantial additional capital to fund expenses. We may, in the future, decide to collaborate with biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of product candidates. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and potential parties may not view such product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If and when we collaborate on the development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the partner. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the following:\n\u2022the design or results of clinical trials;\n\u2022the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the potential market for the product candidate;\n\u2022the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients;\n\u2022the potential of competing products;\n\u2022the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology or other rights, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge; and\n\u2022industry and market conditions generally.\nThe collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under any license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms or at all with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators and changes to the strategies of the combined company. As a result, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay the potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any planned sales or marketing activities for such product candidate, or increase our expenditures and undertake development, manufacturing or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development, manufacturing or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our future product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish such collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such collaborations if, for example, development approval of a product candidate is delayed, the safety of a product candidate is questioned or sales of an approved product candidate are unsatisfactory.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights covering our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur success depends in significant part on our and Biocon\u2019s ability to establish, maintain and protect patents and other intellectual property rights with respect to our proprietary technologies, research programs, and product candidates, including itolizumab (EQ001), and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors, licensees or partners may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current and future licensors, licensees or partners will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research or inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Although we enter into confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development programs, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, independent contractors, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach these agreements and disclose such results before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection on technology relating to our research programs. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors, licensees or partners. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or partners fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or partners are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. There may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\nThe patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation, resulting in court decisions, including Supreme Court decisions, which have increased uncertainties as to the ability to enforce patent rights in the future. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates, or vice versa. We cannot be certain that the claims in our pending patent applications directed to our product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) and others, as well as technologies relating to our research programs, will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or by patent offices in foreign countries. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, patents in our portfolio may not adequately exclude third parties from practicing relevant technology or prevent others from designing around our claims. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or partners\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or partners\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or their intended uses, methods of manufacture or formulations, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. The patent examination process may require us or our licensors, licensees or partners to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or partners\u2019 pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. In the past, we have not always been able to obtain the full scope of patent protection we have initially sought in our patent applications, and as described above and as is typical for most biotechnology patent prosecution, we have been required to narrow or eliminate patent claims as part of the patent prosecution process. In addition, some patent applications that we or our licensors have filed have not resulted in issued patents because we or our licensors have abandoned those patent applications as changes in business and/or legal strategies dictated.\nWe cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art-information that was or is deemed available to a person of skill in the relevant art prior to the priority date of the claimed invention-relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, and we may be subject to a third party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may initiate litigation or opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices, or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated, may allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. The legal threshold for initiating such proceedings may be low, so that even proceedings with a low probability of success might be\ninitiated. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Our and our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or partners\u2019 patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\nBecause patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to our research programs and product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001). Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including biosimilar or generic medications.\nIf we are not able to obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for itolizumab (EQ001) or any other product candidates that we may identify, our business may be materially harmed.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA-approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension may also be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and USPTO, in the United States, and any equivalent foreign regulatory authority, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot predict:\n\u2022if and when patents may issue based on our patent applications;\n\u2022the scope of protection of any patent issuing based on our patent applications;\n\u2022whether the claims of any patent issuing based on our patent applications will provide protection against competitors;\n\u2022whether any of the patents we own or license will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u2022whether or not third parties will find ways to invalidate or circumvent our patent rights;\n\u2022whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications;\n\u2022whether the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022whether we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable;\n\u2022whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to enforce and/or defend our patent rights which will be costly whether we win or lose; and/or\n\u2022whether the patent applications that we own or in-license will result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries.\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from Biocon and termination of our license could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\nWe currently in-license certain intellectual property that is important to our business from Biocon and, in the future, we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. We rely to some extent on Biocon to file patent applications and to otherwise protect the intellectual property we license from them. We have limited control over these activities or any other intellectual property that may be related to our in-licensed intellectual property. For example, we cannot be certain that such activities by Biocon have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. We have limited control over the manner in which Biocon initiates an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of the intellectual property rights, or defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us. It is possible that our licensor\u2019s infringement proceeding or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves.\nFurthermore, in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. Further, our existing license with Biocon imposes, and future agreements may also impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we may be required to pay damages and our licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market the products covered by such licensed intellectual property and our competitors or other third parties might be able to gain access to technologies and products that are identical to ours. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. Furthermore, if any current or future licenses terminate, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties may gain the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. Disputes may also arise between us and our licensor regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including those relating to:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement;\n\u2022our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022whether we are complying with our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u2022the allocation of ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and by us and our partners.\nIn addition, intellectual property or technology license agreements, including our existing agreements, are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described below. If we or our licensor fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nBecause our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return\non our investment. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses of third-party technology that may not be available to us or are available only on commercially unreasonable terms, and which may cause us to operate our business in a more costly or otherwise adverse manner that was not anticipated.\nFrom time to time we may be required to license technologies relating to our therapeutic research programs from additional third parties to further develop or commercialize our product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) and/or others. Should we be required to obtain licenses to any third-party technology, including any such patents required to manufacture, use or sell our product candidates, such licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain any third-party license required to develop or commercialize any of our product candidates could cause us to abandon any related efforts, which could seriously harm our business and operations.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nAny future collaborations that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include that:\n\u2022collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations;\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on trial or test results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities;\n\u2022we could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that causes the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our current or future products or that results in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated, and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable current or future products;\n\u2022collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property; and\n\u2022a collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future patents. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to our therapeutic research programs or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) and/or others in any jurisdiction.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications exist in our market that are owned by third parties, and there may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of itolizumab (EQ001) that we may identify. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We do not always conduct independent reviews of pending patent applications of and patents issued to third parties. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are typically published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Certain U.S. applications that will not be filed outside the United States can remain confidential until patents issue. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or unintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived. Furthermore, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products. As such, there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which we are unaware, potentially relating to our research programs and product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) and others, or their intended uses. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products.\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party\u2019s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, including our research programs, product candidates, which include itolizumab (EQ001) and others, their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof, and could result in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to our future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell itolizumab and other potential future product candidates without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may allege that we have infringed or misappropriated their intellectual property. Litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and, even if resolved in our favor, is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. We cannot assure you that our operations do not, or will not in the future, infringe existing or future patents.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity may be difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity in court requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, and could divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management, cause development delays, and/or require us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property that relate to our current and future product candidates, including itolizumab (EQ001) and others, their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our licensor may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we or our licensor assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent that we own or have licensed is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. For example, an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation or interference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring itolizumab (EQ001) or other product candidates that we may identify to market. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, results of operations business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our issued patent relating to our research programs and product candidates, any patents that may be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other confidential information of current or former employers or competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may become subject to claims that we caused an individual to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, or that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a current or former employer or competitor.\nWhile we may litigate to defend ourselves against these claims, even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management and other employees. If our defenses to these claims fail, in addition to requiring us to pay monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our product candidates, including itolizumab (EQ001), if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the current or former employers. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to form strategic alliances or sublicense our rights to collaborators, engage with scientific advisors or hire employees or consultants, each of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending all current and future patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe legal systems of many foreign countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuities fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent and/or patent application. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our research programs and product candidates such as itolizumab (EQ001) and others as well as their respective methods of use, manufacture and formulations thereof, our competitive position would be adversely affected, as, for example, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe may rely on trade secret and proprietary know-how which can be difficult to trace and enforce and, if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we may also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position with respect to our research programs and product candidates. Elements of our product candidates, including processes for their preparation and manufacture, may involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents, and thus for these aspects we may consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third party consultants and vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical trials or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nTrade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We require our employees to enter into written employment agreements containing provisions of confidentiality and obligations to assign to us any inventions generated in the course of their employment. We and any third parties with whom we share facilities enter into written agreements that include confidentiality and intellectual property obligations to protect each party\u2019s property, potential trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and information. We further seek to protect our potential trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and information in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who are given access to them, such as our corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. With our consultants, contractors, and outside scientific collaborators, these agreements typically include invention assignment obligations. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Moreover, despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is\ndifficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nTrade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. Trade secrets will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. Though our agreements with third parties typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, collaborators, licensors, suppliers, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. Because from time to time we expect to rely on third parties in the development, manufacture, and distribution of our products and provision of our services, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. Despite employing the contractual and other security precautions described above, the need to share trade secrets increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensor may be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an owner, co-owner, inventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are involved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve these and other claims challenging inventorship and/or ownership. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatent rights are of limited duration. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective non-provisional filing date. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from biosimilar or generic products. A patent term extension based on regulatory delay may be available in the United States. However, only a single patent can be extended for each marketing approval, and any patent can be extended only once, for a single product. Moreover, the scope of protection during the period of the patent term extension does not extend to the full scope of the claim, but instead only to the scope of the product as approved. Laws governing analogous patent term extensions in foreign jurisdictions vary widely, as do laws governing the ability to obtain multiple patents from a single patent family. Additionally, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe currently have two U.S. trademark registrations for EQUILLIUM respectively covering Classes 5 and 42, and one Canadian trademark registration for EQUILLIUM covering both Classes 5 and 42. Our current or future trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or descriptive determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. During trademark\nregistration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks and trade names to third parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach of these agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022others may be able to make product candidates that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Employees, Managing Our Growth and Other Legal Matters\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our key personnel, Bruce D. Steel, who serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Connelly, Ph.D., who serves as our Chief Scientific Officer. Although we have entered into agreements with them regarding their employment, they are not for a specific term and each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time, though we are not aware of any present intention of any of these individuals to leave us.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory and operational capabilities and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 45 full-time employees. As we advance itolizumab (EQ001) in clinical development and conduct research and development of the Bioniz assets, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of clinical development, quality, regulatory affairs and, if itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates receive marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must:\n\u2022identify, recruit integrate, maintain and motivate additional qualified personnel;\n\u2022identify and lease additional facilities;\n\u2022manage our development efforts effectively, including the initiation and conduct of clinical trials for itolizumab (EQ001), EQ101, EQ102 and any future product candidates; and\n\u2022improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert financial and other resources, and a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time, to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain CROs and other contract service providers, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including assuming substantial responsibilities for the conduct of our ongoing and future clinical trials and the manufacture of itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates. We cannot assure you that the services of such contract service providers, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by our vendors or consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to properly manage our existing vendors or consultants or find other competent outside vendors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by leasing additional facilities, hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover in recent years. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biopharmaceuticals industry depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and experienced personnel with scientific, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and management skills and experience. We conduct our operations in the Greater San Diego Area and the San Francisco Bay Area regions that are home to many other biopharmaceutical companies as well as many academic and research institutions, resulting in fierce competition for qualified personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical companies. Many of the other biopharmaceutical companies against which we compete have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. Our competitors may provide higher compensation, more diverse opportunities and/or better opportunities for career advancement. Any or all of these competing factors may limit our ability to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, which could negatively affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates and to grow our business and operations as currently contemplated.\nThird-party expectations relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors. Third-party providers of ESG ratings and reports on companies have increased in number, resulting in varied and, in some cases, inconsistent standards. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, the company\u2019s efforts and impacts with respect to climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with the law, and the role of the company\u2019s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In addition to the topics typically considered in such reviews, in our industry, the public\u2019s ability to access our medicines is of particular importance.\nSome investors may use third-party ESG ratings and reports to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our ESG practices are inadequate. The criteria by which companies\u2019 ESG practices are assessed are evolving, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to\nsatisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider, some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to ESG are inadequate and choose not to invest in us.\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our desirability as an investment or business partner could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to adequately pursue or fulfill our goals and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could expose us to additional regulatory, social or other scrutiny of us, the imposition of unexpected costs, or damage to our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nOur employees, clinical trial investigators, CROs, consultants, vendors and any potential commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, clinical trial investigators, CROs, consultants, vendors and any potential commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) FDA laws and regulations or those of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information, (ii) manufacturing standards, (iii) federal and state health and data privacy, security, fraud and abuse, government price reporting, transparency reporting requirements, and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, (iv) sexual harassment and other workplace misconduct, or (v) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, as well as a disclosure program and other applicable policies and procedures, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur internal information technology systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, loss or leakage of data and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, processing) proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data (such as health-related data), intellectual property, and trade secrets (collectively, sensitive information).\nWe may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. We may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties.\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. These threats come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors, and personnel (such as through theft or misuse). Threat actors, personnel, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including for geopolitical and/or military reasons. Specifically, due to the political uncertainty and military actions involving Russia, Ukraine, and surrounding regions, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of\ncyberattacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services.\nWe and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, personnel misconduct or error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats.\nRansomware attacks, including by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.\nSimilarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners\u2019 supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems (including our products and services) or the third-party information technology systems that support us and our services. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections outside our premises.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption. A security incident or other interruption could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our products and services.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information. There can be no assurance that the security measures we and our third-party suppliers have implemented will be effective. We are not always able to detect vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems, or software (including third-party software we have installed on our systems) because such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. Efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems or software (including third-party software we have installed on our systems) may not be successful.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including the delay of development and commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our products and services, deter new customers from using our products and services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we process sensitive information, along with data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities may subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state\ndata breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nAdditionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) imposes obligations on covered businesses. These obligations include, but are not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation) and a private right of action for certain breaches. Although the CCPA exempts some data processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA may increase compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we maintain about California residents. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. Additionally, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CPRA, which could increase the risk of enforcement. Other states have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) and the United Kingdom\u2019s GDPR (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d) impose strict requirements for processing personal data. For example, under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. Further, individuals may initiate litigation related to processing of their personal data.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws, which could make it more difficult to transfer information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal data that originates in the EU or in other foreign jurisdictions). Existing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border personal data transfers may change or be invalidated. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) that the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data privacy and security, such as the United States. The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d (\u201cSCCs\u201d) that are designed to be a valid mechanism to facilitate personal data transfers out of the EEA to these jurisdictions. Currently, these SCCs are a valid mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA, but there exists some uncertainty regarding whether the SCCs will remain a valid mechanism. Additionally, the SCCs impose additional compliance burdens, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data.\nIn addition, the UK similarly restricts personal data transfers outside of those jurisdictions to countries, such as the United States, that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection, and certain countries outside Europe (e.g. China) have also passed or are considering laws requiring local data residency or otherwise impeding the transfer of personal data across borders, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trial activities in Europe and elsewhere; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to such cross-border data transfer or localization laws; or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities and infrastructure in foreign jurisdictions at significant expense.\nOur obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective future legal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires significant resources and may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf.\nAlthough we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail to do so (or be perceived to have failed to have done so). Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we\nrely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party processor to comply with applicable law, regulations, or contractual obligations could result in adverse effects, including inability to or interruption in our ability to operate our business and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-related claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; orders to destroy or not use personal data; and imprisonment of company officials.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; interruptions or stoppages in our business operations (including, as relevant, clinical trials); inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or revision or restructuring of our operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had aggregate U.S. federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $86.4 million. Our U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 could expire unused. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, is generally limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the current U.S. federal income tax law.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage-point cumulative change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced one or more ownership changes in the past. In addition, we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership some of which may be outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income (if we earned net taxable income) and any other pre-ownership change tax attributes may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe conduct significant operations through our Australian wholly-owned subsidiary. If we lose our ability to operate in Australia, or if our subsidiary is unable to receive the research and development tax credit allowed by Australian regulations, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nIn January 2019, we formed a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Equillium Australia Pty Ltd, to conduct the clinical development of itolizumab (EQ001) for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma in Australia and New Zealand. Due to the geographical distance and lack of employees currently in Australia, as well as our lack of experience operating in Australia, we may not be able to efficiently or successfully monitor, develop or commercialize itolizumab (EQ001) in Australia and New Zealand, including conducting clinical trials. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the results of any clinical trials that we conduct for our product candidate in Australia and New Zealand will be accepted by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities for development and commercialization approvals.\nIn addition, current Australian tax regulations provide for a refundable research and development tax credit. If we lose our ability to operate Equillium Australia Pty Ltd in Australia, or if we are ineligible or unable to receive the research and development tax credit, or the Australian government significantly reduces or eliminates the tax credit, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. export control and economic sanctions, our business, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. Our company must comply with these laws and regulations. The antibody sequence for itolizumab (EQ001) is derived from Cuban-origin intellectual property and thus we believe this to be a pharmaceutical of Cuban origin, which would make the import, development and commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001)\nsubject to these laws, sanctions and regulations. We currently rely on a general license issued by OFAC under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, or CACR, relating to Cuban-origin pharmaceuticals to import and conduct clinical trials relating to itolizumab (EQ001). In the absence of the OFAC general license, all of our development and potential commercialization activities for itolizumab (EQ001) would be prohibited under the CACR, and we would be required to request a specific license from OFAC authorizing such activities, which OFAC could deny.\nWe submitted to OFAC, and subsequently amended and supplemented, a request for interpretive guidance confirming the applicability of the general license to itolizumab (EQ001), or in its absence, a specific license authorization from OFAC authorizing activities relating to the commercialization of itolizumab (EQ001), or the Submission. We simultaneously requested that OFAC treat the Submission as a voluntary disclosure if OFAC concluded that our determination that the general license applies to itolizumab (EQ001) was in error.\nIn November 2019, OFAC notified us that after careful consideration, which included consultation with the FDA, OFAC determined that itolizumab (EQ001) falls within the definition of \u201cCuban-origin pharmaceutical\u201d and, as such, the general licenses at section 515.547(b) and (c) of the CACR authorize the conduct of clinical trials for itolizumab (EQ001) for the purpose of seeking approval for the drug from the FDA. Thus, no further authorization is required from OFAC at this time for our ongoing and future clinical trials of itolizumab (EQ001).\nEven though OFAC has concluded that the general license for Cuban-origin pharmaceuticals applies to itolizumab (EQ001), there can be no assurance that the general license will not be revoked or modified by OFAC in the future, or that we will remain in compliance with the general license or other export laws and regulations. If OFAC revokes or modifies the general license, or otherwise determines that the general license does not apply to itolizumab (EQ001), and OFAC then denies our request for a specific license or delays issuance of a specific license, we will be unable to deal in, or otherwise commercialize, itolizumab (EQ001). In that case, we would be required to cease operations related to itolizumab (EQ001), which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects. In addition, in the absence of the general or specific license, the transfer, sale and/or purchase of our securities could be prohibited, and the ownership or possession of our securities could be subject to an affirmative OFAC reporting requirement relating to blocked property. Any violations of the CACR or other applicable export control and sanctions laws could subject us and certain of our employees to substantial civil or criminal penalties.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and may have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere have been, and continue to be, numerous legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access and the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nThe Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things: (i) introduced a \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d calculation for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and that are not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (ii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; (iii) established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (iv) expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (v) established Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers currently must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability; (vii) created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and (viii) established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.\nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nof 2017, or TCJA, was enacted, which included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7-2 opinion that the states and individuals challenging the constitutionality of Affordable Care Act do not have standing to challenge the law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the challenge regarding Affordable Care Act\u2019s constitutionality, but the decision ended the case. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the Affordable Care Act that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug\u2019s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations.\nAlso, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Trump administration proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act until January 1, 2026. In addition, on November 20, 2020, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinds the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, individual states in the United States are increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing\nWe expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once marketing approval is obtained.\nIf any of our services providers are characterized as employees, we would be subject to employment and tax withholding liabilities and other additional costs.\nWe rely on independent contractors to provide certain services to us. We structure our relationships with these outside services providers in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. An independent contractor is generally distinguished from an employee by his or her degree of autonomy and independence in providing services. A high degree of autonomy and independence is generally indicative of an independent contractor relationship, while a high degree of control is generally indicative of an employment relationship. Tax or other regulatory authorities may challenge our characterization of services providers as independent contractors both under existing laws and regulations and under laws and regulations adopted in the future. We are aware of a number of judicial decisions and legislative proposals that could bring about major changes in the way workers are classified, including the California legislature\u2019s recent passage of California Assembly Bill 5, which California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law in September 2019, or AB 5, and Assembly Bill 2257, or AB 2257, which went into effect in September 2020 and amended certain portions of AB 5. AB 5 and AB 2257 are often referred to collectively simply as AB 5. AB 5 purports to codify the holding of the California Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, which introduced a new test for determining worker classification that is widely viewed as expanding the scope of employee relationships and narrowing the scope of independent contractor relationships. While AB 5 exempts certain licensed health care professionals, including physicians and psychologists, not all of our independent contractors work in exempt occupations. Given AB 5\u2019s recent passage, there is little guidance from the regulatory authorities charged with its enforcement and there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding its application. In addition, AB 5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion and it is possible that other jurisdictions might enact similar laws. As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding what the state, federal and foreign worker classification regulatory landscape will look like in future years. The current economic climate indicates that the debate over worker classification will continue for the foreseeable future. If such regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our services providers are employees and not independent contractors, we would, among other things, be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay Social Security, Medicare and similar taxes, to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes, and to provide certain employee benefits. We could also be liable for unpaid past taxes and other costs and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that the service providers we characterize as independent contractors should be classified as employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to applicable foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency, government price reporting, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any future product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct research and would market, sell and distribute our products. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in\norder to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the FCA which can be enforced by private citizens, on behalf of the government, through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment or approval by the federal government, including federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have investigated pharmaceutical companies for or asserted liability under the FCA for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products, engaging in promotion for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program;\n\u2022HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and their implementing regulations, which imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022the U.S. federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;\n\u2022the Public Health Service Act, which prohibits, among other things, the introduction of a biological product into interstate commerce without an approved BLA;\n\u2022federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests, including such ownership and investment interests held by a physician\u2019s immediate family members;\n\u2022state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by any non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n\u2022state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians, other health care providers, and certain health care entities; report information related to drug pricing; and/or ensure the registration and compliance of sales personnel. In addition, we may be subject to federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nWe have entered into consulting and scientific advisory board arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, including some who could influence the use of itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates, if approved. Because of the complex and far-reaching nature of these laws, regulatory agencies may view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured, or discontinued, or for which we could be subject to other significant penalties. We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies interpret our financial relationships with providers who may influence the ordering of and use of itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates, if approved, to be in violation of applicable laws.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies, healthcare providers and other third parties, including charitable foundations, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices, including our consulting arrangements with physicians, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. Responding to investigations can be time and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other current or future governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and certain foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nU.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, or collectively Trade Laws, prohibit, among other things, companies and their employees, agents, CROs, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase over time. We expect to rely on contract service providers for research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other marketing approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022delays or other adverse impacts to our clinical trials from global health epidemics, such as those related to COVID-19;\n\u2022our ability to enroll and retain subjects in our ongoing and future clinical trials;\n\u2022results from our ongoing and future clinical trials with our current and future product candidates, and the results of the clinical trials of our competitors or of Biocon;\n\u2022adverse events observed in our clinical trials or in the clinical trials, exploratory studies, or other clinical uses of itolizumab supported by Biocon or third parties or during post-approval use of itolizumab;\n\u2022the timing of topline data from ongoing trials, including our ongoing and planned clinical trials of itolizumab;\n\u2022changes in our projected operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries of ours, our competitors\u2019, or Biocon\u2019s;\n\u2022the level of expenses related to future product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022our ability to achieve product development goals in the timeframe we announce;\n\u2022announcements of clinical trial results, regulatory developments, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us, by our competitors, or by Biocon;\n\u2022the success or failure of our efforts to acquire, license or develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a substantial proportion of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022the size of our market float; and\n\u2022any other factors discussed in this report.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and conflict in Ukraine, that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many life sciences companies. Stock prices of many biopharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and license agreements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. In July 2020, we entered into the 2020 ATM Facility with Jefferies under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million from time to time through Jefferies acting as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2021, we have sold an aggregate of 788,685 shares of our common stock under the 2020 ATM facility for gross proceeds of $10.4 million. There have been no sales of shares of our common stock under the 2020 ATM Facility since December 31, 2021 and through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of our common stock, from time to time over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement, and we issued an additional 65,374 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares under the Purchase Agreement. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nDebt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Subject to limited exceptions, our Loan Agreement also prohibits us from incurring indebtedness without the prior written consent of the lenders.\nIf we raise funds through collaboration and license agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIf there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale and the market perceives that sales will occur. As of March 18, 2022, we had 34,275,898 shares of our common stock outstanding. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements. We have registered shares of common stock that we have issued and may issue under our employee equity incentive plans, which shares may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance. Sales of our common stock by current stockholders may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, and make it more difficult for other stockholders to sell shares of our common stock.\nThe market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and the holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022permit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control);\n\u2022provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022provide that the board of directors or any individual director may only be removed with cause and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all of our then outstanding common stock;\n\u2022provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022divide our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose);\n\u2022provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, our Chief Executive Officer or by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n\u2022provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law; (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These provisions would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nThe amendment of any of these provisions, with the exception of the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and designate any rights, preferences and privileges thereto, would require approval by the holders of at least 66-2/3% of our then-outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022 any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid and several state trial courts have enforced such provisions and required that suits asserting Securities Act claims be filed in federal court, there is no guarantee that courts of appeal will affirm the enforceability of such provisions and a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with litigating Securities Act claims in state court, or both state and federal court, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAs a public company in the United States, we incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nCompanies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, must contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis remains a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be\nunreliable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline as a result.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Market or other regulatory authorities.\nFurthermore, stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, any new regulations or disclosure obligations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe or the parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, fires, other natural disasters, or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events, including public health events, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur headquarters and main research facility are located in the Greater San Diego Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes and fires. If these earthquakes, fires, other natural disasters, terrorism and similar unforeseen events beyond our control prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters or research facility, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We do not have a disaster recovery or business continuity plan in place and may incur substantial expenses as a result of the absence or limited nature of our internal or third party service provider disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events, including public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic that could impact our business. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our clinical trials, our development plans and business. For example, in March 2020, due to the spread of the coronavirus, the Indian government restricted the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them. These export restrictions are indefinite and may be expanded. If the export restrictions are expanded to include itolizumab (EQ001), our supply of itolizumab (EQ001) may be disrupted, delayed or stopped indefinitely and our ability to continue development of itolizumab (EQ001), including our ongoing clinical trials, may be significantly impacted and may result in higher costs of drug product and adversely harm our business.\nChanges in patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents relating to our research programs and product candidates. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or USPTO rules and regulations could increase the uncertainties and costs. Recent patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law on September 16, 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications, our ability to obtain future patents, and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit our commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that itolizumab (EQ001) or any future product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022delay or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial subjects;\n\u2022initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation and diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to study subjects or patients;\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, or marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022loss of revenue; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently have product liability insurance. However, the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage as itolizumab (EQ001) and any future product candidates advance through clinical trials and if we successfully commercialize any products. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, on December 22, 2017, U.S. federal income tax legislation was signed into law (H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d), informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, legislation enacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, modified certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, Congress and the Biden administration have recently proposed legislation (which has not yet been enacted) to make various tax law changes, including to increase U.S. taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals and they are subject to change, if enacted, they could have a material effect on out income tax liability. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. We do not expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or the CARES Act to have a material impact on our current projection of minimal cash taxes for the near future. However, we continue to examine the impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the CARES Act may have on\nour business in the longer term. We urge prospective investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe, and the third parties with whom we share our facilities, are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Each of our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Each of our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. We could be held liable for any resulting damages in the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use of hazardous materials by us or the third parties with whom we share our facilities, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research and development. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nWe believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing us to fail to make any related party transaction disclosures. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. In addition, we do not have a risk management program or processes or procedures for identifying and addressing risks to our business in other areas.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u2022being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022not being required to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (i.e. December 31, 2023), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, including due to limitations that are currently imposed by our Loan Agreement. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 18195, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EQ"}
