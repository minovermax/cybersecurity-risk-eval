{"cik": "1083446", "company": "Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, and may have to further reduce our costs by curtailing future operations to continue as a business.\nHistorically, we have had operating losses and our cash flow has been inadequate to support our ongoing operations. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we had a net loss of approximately $8.7 million, and as of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $37.7 million. Our ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations depends on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate recently acquired businesses and continue growing our existing operations. If we cannot continue to generate positive cash flow from operations, we will have to reduce our costs and/or try to raise working capital from other sources. These measures could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business as we presently do and execute our business model.\nGoing Concern\nAs shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have incurred net loss of approximately $8.7 million and used approximately $8.1 million in cash from operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2017, and, as of March 31, 2017 have an accumulated deficit and a stockholders\u2019 deficit attributable to ApolloMed of approximately $37.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The primary source of liquidity as of March 31, 2017 is cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.7 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that we cannot continue as a going concern.\nWe need to raise additional capital, which might not be available.\nWe require significant additional capital for general working capital and liquidity needs. If our cash flow and existing working capital are not sufficient to fund our general working capital and liquidity requirements, as well as any debt service requirements, we will have to raise additional funds by selling equity, issuing debt, borrowings, refinancing some or all of our existing debt or selling assets or subsidiaries. None of these alternatives for raising additional funds may be available, or available on acceptable terms to us, in amounts sufficient for us to meet our requirements. Our failure to obtain any required new financing may, if needed, require us to reduce or curtail certain existing operations or make us unable to continue to operate our business.\nThe Merger has not yet been consummated and the failure to consummate the Merger could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn December 21, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with NMM. Consummation of the Merger is subject to antitrust regulatory clearance and other closing conditions, as well as approval by NMM stockholders and our stockholders, none of which has yet occurred. If for any reason the Merger is not consummated, we would have significant financial obligations to NMM in connection with previous financing transactions in which we have engaged. Additionally, as we anticipate that NMM will be an important future source of working capital for us after the consummation of the Merger, we might lose such additional funding. Furthermore, there are several areas of operations in which NMM and we work together, including APAACO, which is owned 50% by NMM and 50% by us, as well as MSAs we have with certain NMM affiliates. If for any reason the Merger is not consummated, we cannot predict the effect this would have on areas where we operate together and for which we are dependent upon significant revenue.\nThe pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe pendency of the Merger could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u00b7 Our employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel; and\n\u00b7 the attention of our management may be directed towards the completion of the Merger and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, and matters related to the Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement place certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing of the Merger, including entering into a business combination with another party.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts NMM and us from taking certain specified actions with respect to the conduct of its business without the other party\u2019s consent while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or other capital structure alternatives and making other changes to our business or executing certain of its business strategies prior to the completion of the Merger, which opportunities, alternatives or other changes could be favorable to our stockholders.\nThere is no assurance when or if the Merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the benefits that we expect to obtain from the Merger and any failure to complete the Merger could harm our future business and operations.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that NMM or we will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our respective control will be satisfied or waived. In addition, NMM or we can agree at any time to terminate the Merger Agreement. NMM and we can also terminate the Merger Agreement under other specified circumstances.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the anticipated timeframe, such delay could result in additional transaction costs or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses could be adversely affected and we will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the Merger, including without limitation the following:\n\u00b7 certain costs related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed;\n\u00b7 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay NMM a termination fee of\u2009 $1.5 million;\n\u00b7 the attention of our management may have been diverted to the Merger rather than to our operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us;\n\u00b7 the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the company;\n\u00b7 reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger;\n\u00b7 the price of our stock may decline and remain volatile;\n\u00b7 we have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses which may have prevented us from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the Merger was pending; and\n\u00b7 we may be subject to litigation related to the Merger or any failure to complete the Merger.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, we might have an immediate financial need to raise additional capital to fund our business and meet our expenses, including both transactional and operational expenses.\nThe terms of debt agreements could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions and an event of default under our debt agreements could harm our business.\nAgreements for any future indebtedness would likely contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. Debt agreements often include covenants that, among other things, generally:\n\u00b7 do not allow the borrower to borrow additional amounts or additional amounts above a certain limit, or that are senior to the existing debt, without the approval of the creditor;\n\u00b7 require the borrower to obtain the consent of the creditor for acquisitions in excess of an agreed upon amount and/or grant security interests in newly-acquired companies;\n\u00b7 do not allow the borrower to dispose of assets;\n\u00b7 do not allow the borrower to liquidate, wind up or dissolve any of its subsidiaries without the creditor\u2019s approval;\n\u00b7 do not allow the borrower to create any liens on any of its assets;\n\u00b7 require the borrower not to impair any security interests that the creditor has in the borrower\u2019s assets; and\n\u00b7 require the borrower to meet, on an ongoing basis, certain financial covenants, which may include targets as to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated tangible net worth.\nNo assurances can be given that we will be able to meet any of the financial covenants in favor of a creditor, and, if we were to fail to meet any financial covenants, there would be an event of default and no assurance can be given that a creditor would waive such default, which in turn could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue our operations.\nWe are required to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the sale of a former creditor\u2019s registrable securities by December 31, 2017.\nOn March 28, 2014, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with NNA of Nevada, Inc. (\u201cNNA\u201d), an affiliate of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA (\u201cFresenius\u201d), which has been amended from time to time. Presently, we are required to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the sale of NNA\u2019s registrable securities issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement by December 31, 2017. If we fail to do so by such date, and for each month thereafter until we file the registration statement registering NNA\u2019s registrable securities, we must pay NNA liquidated damages of 1.5% of the total purchase price of the registrable securities owned by NNA, payable in shares of our common stock. This may result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nWe are required to obtain NNA\u2019s consent to the preparation and filing of any registration statement except in limited circumstances.\nWe will have to obtain the consent of NNA before filing any registration statement except in limited circumstances, and there can be no assurance that NNA will provide such a consent, if required. If NNA does not provide such a consent, or conditioned its consent on any new requirements, we may be unable to file a registration statement in the future, even if such filing is necessary to raise capital needed to operate our business.\nThe nature of our business and rapid changes in the healthcare industry makes it difficult to reliably predict future growth and operating results.\nRapidly changing Federal and state healthcare laws, and the regulations thereunder, make it difficult to anticipate the nature and amount of medical reimbursements, third party private payments and participation in certain government programs. For example, we were awarded a participation agreement under CMS\u2019 MSSP in July 2012, to operate as an ACO. ACO has received an \u201call or nothing\u201d payment under the MSSP program for services rendered in fiscal 2015, but did not receive such a payment for fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017. This makes it difficult to forecast our future earnings, cash flow and results of operations. The evolving nature of the current medical services industry increases these uncertainties.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth.\nWe may not be able to successfully grow and expand. Successful implementation of our business plan requires that we manage our growth, including potentially rapid and substantial growth, which could result in an increase in the level of responsibility for management personnel and strain on our human and capital resources. To manage growth effectively, we will be required, among other things, to continue to implement and improve our operating and financial systems and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel. If we are unable to implement and scale improvements to all our control systems in an efficient and timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available the services required to successfully execute our business plan. Failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel could further strain our human resources and impede our growth or result in ineffective growth. Moreover, the management, systems and controls currently in place or to be implemented may not be adequate for such growth, and the steps taken to hire personnel and to improve such systems and controls might not be sufficient. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, the failure to do may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate recently acquired and launched entities and may have difficulty predicting the future needs of those entities.\nIn fiscal 2015, we acquired SCHC, AKM, BCHC and HCHHA, and launched ACC and APS. In fiscal 2016, we formed Apollo Care Connect and combined the operations of AKM into those of MMG, and disposed of substantially all the assets of ACC. In fiscal 2017, we acquired BAHA and formed APAACO to operate under the NGACO Model.\nAs a result of our rapid expansion we may be unable to successfully integrate the various entities we have acquired or formed. Additionally, these entities operate in different areas of the health care industry and we cannot accurately predict how these acquired entities will perform in the future, integrate into our entire operations or result in a diversion of management focus and attention to others parts of our business.\nOur growth strategy may not prove viable and expected growth and value may not be realized.\nOur business strategy is to grow rapidly by managing a network of medical groups providing certain hospital-based services and integrated inpatient and outpatient physician networks. We also seek growth opportunities both organically and through the acquisition of target medical groups and other service providers. Identifying quality acquisition candidates is a time-consuming and costly process. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and establishing relationships with these and other candidates. If we are not successful in identifying and acquiring other entities, our ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results could be adversely affected. The process of integrating acquired entities involves significant risks, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 demands on our management team related to the significant increase in the size of our business;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices;\n\u00b7 difficulties in conforming the acquired entities\u2019 accounting policies to ours;\n\u00b7 retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting;\n\u00b7 systems, technologies, books and records, procedures and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls;\n\u00b7 procedures, and policies; and\n\u00b7 costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration of our acquisitions or the growth of such acquisitions effectively.\nAn element of our growth strategy is also the expansion of our business by developing new palliative care programs in our existing markets and in new markets. This aspect of our growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our overall growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 identify markets that meet our selection criteria for new palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 hire and retain a qualified management team to operate each of our new palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 manage a large and geographically diverse group of palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;\n\u00b7 generate a sufficient patient base in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets; or\n\u00b7 compete effectively with existing programs.\nWe may not make appropriate acquisitions, may fail to integrate them into our business, or these acquisitions could alter our current payor mix and reduce our revenue.\nOur business is significantly dependent on locating and acquiring or partnering with medical practices or individual physicians to provide health care services. As part of our growth strategy, we regularly review potential acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing such acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any such acquisitions would be. If we are not successful in finding attractive acquisition candidates that we can acquire on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot successfully complete and efficiently integrate those acquisitions that we identify, we may not be able to implement our business model, which would likely negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities or successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any suitable opportunities. In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. This competition may intensify due to the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry, which may increase our acquisition costs.\n\u00b7 We may be unable to successfully and efficiently integrate completed acquisitions, including our recently completed acquisitions and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations involves numerous short-term and long-term risks, including diversion of our management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, failure to retain payor contracts and failure of the acquired practice to be financially successful.\n\u00b7 We cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws. We may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired entities. Also, depending on the location of the acquisition, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations that may differ from those of the states in which our operations are currently conducted.\n\u00b7 We may acquire individual or group medical practices that operate with lower profit margins as compared with our current or expected profit margins or which have a different payor mix than our other practice groups, which would reduce our profit margins. Depending upon the nature of the local healthcare market, we may not be able to implement our business model in every local market that we enter, which may negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.\n\u00b7 If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders could be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. If we finance an acquisition with debt, it could result in higher leverage and interest costs. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, and we may increase our acquisition costs.\nChanges to the fair value of contingent compensation payments to be paid in connection with our acquisitions may result in significant fluctuations to our results of operations.\nIn connection with some of our recent acquisitions we are required to make certain contingent compensation payments. The fair value of such payments is re-evaluated periodically based on changes in our estimate of future operating results and changes in market discount rates. Any changes in our estimated fair value are recognized in our results of operations. Increases in the amount of contingent compensation payments were are required to make may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur management team\u2019s attention may be diverted by recent acquisitions and searches for new acquisition targets, and our business and operations may suffer adverse consequences as a result.\nMergers and acquisitions are time-intensive, requiring significant commitment of our management team\u2019s focus and resources. If our management team spends too much time focused on recent acquisitions or on potential acquisition targets, our management team may not have sufficient time to focus on our existing business and operations. This diversion of attention could have material and adverse consequences on our operations and our ability to be profitable.\nOur growth strategy incurs significant costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur growth-by-acquisition strategy involves significant costs, including financial advisory, legal and accounting fees, and may include additional costs, including costs of fairness opinions, labor costs, termination payments, contingent payments and bonuses, among others. These costs could put a strain on our available cash and cash flow, which in turn could adversely affect our overall financial condition.\nWe may be unable to scale our operations successfully.\nOur growth strategy will place significant demands on our management and financial, administrative and other resources. Operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our operations, the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe could experience significant losses under our capitation-based contracts if the medical expenses we incur exceed revenues.\nIn California, health plans typically prospectively pay an IPA a fixed PMPM amount, or capitation payment, which is often based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to IPAs, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the IPA manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that IPA. If our IPAs are able to manage care-related expenses under the capitated levels, we realize an operating profit on our capitation contracts. However, if our care-related expenses exceed projected levels, our IPAs may realize substantial operating deficits, which are not capped and could lead to substantial losses.\nOur future growth could be harmed if we lose the services of Dr. Hosseinion.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management personnel, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Warren Hosseinion, M.D., for the management of our business and implementation of our business strategy. We have entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Hosseinion and we hold a $5 million key man life insurance policy. The loss of Dr. Hosseinion\u2019s services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree. This includes that our founders, Warren Hosseinion, M.D. and Adrian Vazquez, M.D., combined currently own more than 35% of our shares and have significant influence over our operations and strategic direction.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, as a group, currently beneficially own approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors and holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, assuming they agree, have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including among other things:\n\u00b7 changes to the composition of our Board of Directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;\n\u00b7 proposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and\n\u00b7 amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.\nThis concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of our executive officers, directors and holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price.\nThis concentration of ownership is underscored by the fact that Dr. Hosseinion (who currently owns approximately 19% of our common stock) and Dr. Vazquez (who currently owns approximately 16% of our common stock) together currently own more than 35% of our common stock and exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. As stockholders, Drs. Hosseinion and Vazquez are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Their concentrated holdings of so much of our common stock may harm the value of our shares and discourage investors from investing in us. Drs. Hosseinion and Vazquez could also seek to delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that other stockholders may support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of a transaction that other stockholders may not support.\nIf our agreements or arrangements with Dr. Hosseinion or physician groups are deemed invalid under state corporate practice of medicine and similar laws, or Federal law, or are terminated as a result of changes in state law, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are various state laws, including laws in California, regulating the corporate practice of medicine which prohibits us from owning various healthcare entities. This corporate practice of medicine prohibitions are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a physician\u2019s professional judgment. These and other laws may also prevent fee-splitting, which is the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. As a result, we have structured other agreements and arrangements with these entities, such as having Dr. Hosseinion hold shares in such practices as nominee shareholder for our benefit. If these agreements and arrangements were held to be invalid under state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, a significant portion of our revenues would be affected, which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any changes to Federal or state law that prohibit such agreements or arrangements could also have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lost the services of Dr. Hosseinion for any reason, the contractual arrangements with our VIEs could be in jeopardy.\nBecause of corporate practice of medicine laws, many of our affiliated physician practice groups are either wholly-owned or primarily owned by Dr. Hosseinion as nominee shareholder for our benefit. If Dr. Hosseinion died, was incapacitated or otherwise was no longer affiliated with our company, there could be a material adverse effect on the relationship between each of those VIEs and us and, therefore, our business as a whole could be adversely affected.\nThe contractual arrangements we have with ours VIEs is not as secure as direct ownership of such entities.\nBecause of corporate practice of medicine laws, we enter into contractual arrangements to manage certain affiliated physician practice groups, which allows us to consolidate those groups with us for financial reporting purposes. If we had direct ownership of certain of our affiliated entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the boards of directors of those entities, which could effect changes at the management and operational level. Under our contractual arrangements, we may not be able to directly change the members of the boards of directors of these entities and would have to rely on the entities and the entities\u2019 equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the entities. If any of these affiliated entities or their equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements.\nAny failure by our key affiliated entities or their equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements they have with us would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also own the majority, and not all, of the equity of certain subsidiaries.\nSeveral of our affiliated physician practice groups are owned by other physicians who could die, become incapacitated or otherwise become no longer affiliated with us. Although the terms of the MSAs we have with these affiliates provide that the MSA will be binding on the successors of such affiliates\u2019 equity holders, as those successors are not parties to the MSAs, it is uncertain whether the successors in case of the death, bankruptcy or divorce of an equity holder would be subject to such MSAs.\nIn addition, although we consolidate in our financial reporting and business structure ApolloMed ACO and APS, individuals other than Dr. Hosseinion, who acts as nominee shareholder for our benefit of AMM, also own approximately 20% of the equity of ApolloMed ACO and 44% of the equity in APS. Additionally, we consolidate APAACO in our financial reporting, although we own 50% of the equity in that entity.\nOur operations are dependent on a few key payors.\nWe had four payors during the year ended March 31, 2017 that accounted for 18.8%, 13.1%, 8.5% and 6.8% of net revenues, respectively. We had three payors during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 that accounted for 29.8%, 15.7% and 9.9% of net revenues, respectively. We believe that a majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from a few payors. Each payor may immediately terminate any of our contracts or any individual credentialed physician upon the occurrence of certain events. They may also amend the material terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. Failure to maintain the contracts on favorable terms or at all, for any reason, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA decline in the number of patients we serve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLike any business, a material decline in the number of patients we serve, whether they or a third party government or private entity is paying for their healthcare, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nACOs are relatively new and undergoing changes, additionally CMS may change or discontinue the MSSP program.\nThe Company has invested resources in both applying to participate in the MSSP and in establishing initial infrastructure. The MSSP program and the rules regarding ACOs has been altered and may be further altered in the future. Any material change to the MSSP program and ACO requirements, governance and operating rules, could provide a significant financial risk for us and alter our strategic direction, thereby producing stockholder risk and uncertainty. In addition, we could be terminated from the MSSP if we do not comply with the MSSP participation requirements.\nApolloMed ACO may not generate savings through its participation in the MSSP, and revenue, if any, earned by such participation will occur, only once annually on an \u201call or nothing\u201d basis.\nApolloMed ACO participates in the MSSP sponsored by CMS. The MSSP is a relatively new program with limited history of payments to ACO participants. As a result of the uncertain nature of the MSSP program, we consider revenue, if any, under the MSSP, as contingent upon the realization of program savings as determined by CMS, and revenues are not considered earned and therefore are not recognized until notice from CMS that cash payments are to be imminently received.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will meet the conditions necessary for receipt of future payments. Furthermore, our ability to continue to generate savings for the MSSP program depends on many factors, many of which are outside our control, including, among others, how CMS elects to administer the MSSP program, how savings levels are calculated and continued political support of the MSSP program. As a result, whether future revenues will be earned by ApolloMed ACO is uncertain and will be contingent on various factors, including whether savings were determined to be achieved in 2015 or in any other period during which savings are measured.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we were awarded and received approximately a $5.4 million payment related to savings achieved from July 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013, which represented 16% of our net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2015. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, we did not receive any MSSP payment. We are eligible to be considered for an all-or-nothing payment under this program for performance year 2016 (which, if it is paid, would be paid to us in fiscal 2018). However, we do not believe that we will be eligible to receive payments for performance years beginning 2017, because of our transition to, and business focus on, the NGACO Model, in which we are participating as of January 1, 2017.\nMoreover, if amounts are payable to us under the MSSP, they will be paid on an annual basis significantly after the time they are earned. Additionally, since MSSP payments, if any, are made once annually, we would not receive such payments spread out over our fiscal year and, consequently, revenue may be materially lower in quarters when any MSSP-related payments are not received by us.\nThe success of our emphasis on the new NGACO Model is uncertain.\nTo position ourselves to participate in the NGACO Model, we have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, significant effort and resources, financial and otherwise, to the NGACO Model, and refocused away from certain other parts of our historic business and revenue streams, which will receive less emphasis in the future and could result in reduced revenue from these activities. It is unknown at this time if this strategic decision will be successful in terms of our emphasis on the NGACO Model and/or placing less emphasis on certain other parts of our core business and revenue streams.\nThe results of the NGACO Model are unknown.\nThe NGACO Model is a new CMS program that builds upon previous ACO programs, including the MSSP program. Through the NGACO Model, CMS will provide an opportunity to APAACO and other NGACOs experienced in coordinating care for populations of patients, and whose provider groups are willing to assume higher levels of financial risk and reward, to participate in this new attribution-based risk sharing model. In January 2017, CMS approved APAACO to participate in the NGACO Model and CMS and APAACO have entered into a Participation Agreement with a term of two performance years through December 31, 2018. CMS may offer to renew the Participation Agreement for an additional two performance years. Additionally, the Participation Agreement may be terminated sooner by CMS as specified therein and CMS has the flexibility to alter or change the program over this time period. The number of Medicare ACOs continues to rise in total but there are still a growing number of program types and demonstrations that could be consolidated and impact APAACO.\nThe NGACO Model program has certain political risks.\nIf the ACA is amended or repealed and replaced, or if CMMI is terminated, the NGACO Model program could be discontinued or significantly altered. In addition, CMS leadership could be changed and influenced by Congress and/or the current Administration. Additionally, CMS or CMMI may elect to combine any existing programs, including bundled payments, which could greatly alter the NGACO Model program.\nAPAACO\u2019s participation in the NGACO Model program subjects it to certain regulatory risks.\nAmong many requirements to be eligible to participate in the NGACO Model program, APAACO must have at least 10,000 assigned Medicare beneficiaries and must maintain that number throughout each performance year. Although APAACO started its 2017 performance year with more than 32,000 assigned Medicare beneficiaries, there can be no assurance that APAACO will maintain the required number of assigned Medicare beneficiaries, and, if that number were not maintained, APAACO would become ineligible for the program.\nAPAACO is subject to changing state laws and regulations.\nNGACOs are required to comply with all applicable state laws and regulations regarding provider-based risk-bearing entities. If these laws or regulations change, for example, to require a Knox-Keene license in California, which we do not have, APAACO could be required to cease its NGACO operations.\nAPAACO may experience losses due to the NGACO Model Program.\nAPAACO is responsible for savings and losses from claims. The NGACO Model uses a prospectively-set cost benchmark, which is established prior to the start of each performance year. The benchmark is based on various factors, including baseline expenditures with the baseline updated each year to reflect the NGACO\u2019s participant list for the given year. The 2017 performance year NGACO Model baseline for APAACO is based on calendar year 2014 expenditures that are then trended. Regional, population and time adjustments could potentially underestimate APAACO\u2019s actual expenditures for its Medicare Part A and Part B beneficiaries.\nIf claims cost rise from benchmark, or 2014 and/or 2017 are statistically anomalies, APAACO could experience losses due to the NGACO Model program, which could be significant prior to any adjustment in benchmarked expenditures.\nAdditionally, given that APAACO is providing care coordination but does not employ any physicians nor provide direct patient care, the degree of influence APAACO has could be limited and out of its direct control. Because of APAACO\u2019s limited influence, it is possible APAACO may not be able to influence provider and preferred provider behavior, utilization and patient costs.\nAPAACO\u2019s dependence on CMS creates uncertainty and subjects APAACO to potential liability.\nAPAACO relies on CMS for design, oversight and governance of the NGACO Model program. Accurate data, claims benchmarking and calculations, timely payments and periodic process reviews are key to program success. In addition to APAACO\u2019s administrative and care coordination operating costs, APAACO may not generate savings through its participation in the NGACO Model. Any savings generated, if at all, will be earned in arrears and uncertain in both timing and amount.\nAPAACO chose to participate in the AIPBP payment mechanism, which entails certain special risks.\nAPAACO chose to participate in the AIPBP payment mechanism, and is the only NGACO to have chosen this payment mechanism. Under the AIPBP payment mechanism, CMS will estimate the total annual Part A and Part B Medicare expenditures of APAACO\u2019s assigned Medicare beneficiaries and pay that projected amount in per beneficiary per month payments. APAACO chose \u201cRisk Arrangement A\u201d, comprising 80% risk for Part A and Part B Medicare expenditures and a shared savings and losses cap of 5%, or as a result a 4% effective shared savings and losses cap when factoring in 80% risk impact. APAACO\u2019s benchmark Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures for beneficiaries for its 2017 performance year are approximately $335 million, and under \u201cRisk Arrangement A\u201d of the AIPBP payment mechanism APAACO could therefore have profits or be liable for losses of up to 4% of such benchmarked expenditures, or approximately $13.4 million. While performance can be monitored throughout the year, end results will not be known until 2018.\nCMS has indicated that its initial financial reports to participants in the NGACO Model may not be complete.\nThe NGACO Model is new and CMS is implementing extensive reporting protocols in connection therewith. CMS has indicated that it does not anticipate initial reports under the NGACO Model to be indicative of final results of actual risk-sharing and revenues to which we are entitled, especially for the period January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2017, which is the first quarter of the NGACO program and the fourth quarter of our 2017 fiscal year. This is because there are inherent biases in reporting the results at such an early juncture. Were that to be the case, we might not report accurately our revenues for this period, which could be subject to adjustment in a later period once we receive final results from CMS.\nAPAACO requires significant capital reserves for program participation.\nNGACOs must provide a financial guarantee to CMS. The financial guarantee must be in an amount of 2% of the NGACO\u2019s benchmark Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures. APAACO\u2019s benchmark Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures for beneficiaries for its 2017 performance year being approximately $335 million, APAACO submitted a letter of credit for $6.7 million for the 2017 program year. If APAACO reaches the maximum of its shared losses of $13.4 million, it may need to pay another $6.7 million to CMS or CMS may change or alter the risk reserve process or amount. Additionally, the incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) methodology utilized by CMS could have a negative impact on APAACO and affect working capital and capital requirements.\nAPAACO is responsible for savings and losses related to care received by its patients at Out-of-Network Providers which could negatively impact our ability to control claim costs.\nMedicare beneficiaries in a NGACO Model program are not required to receive their care from a narrow network of contracted providers and facilities, which could make it challenging for APAACO to control the financial risks of those beneficiaries. CMS notified APAACO that its Medicare beneficiaries historically have received approximately 62% of their care at non-contracted, out-of-network (\"OON\") providers. While not responsible for paying claims for OON providers, APAACO may have difficulty managing patient care and costs as compared to in-network providers. Additionally, APAACO is responsible for savings and losses of this population using OON providers, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, if APAACO is successful under its Participation Agreement with CMS in encouraging more of its patients to receive their care with contracted, in-network providers, there is the possibility that the monthly AIPBP payments will be insufficient to cover current expenditures, since the AIPBP payments will be based on historical in-network/out-of-network ratios. This could potentially result in negative cash-flow problems for APAACO, if increased payments need to be made to contracted, in-network providers, especially if CMS fails to monitor this in-network/OON ratio on a frequent periodic basis and reconciliation payments are materially delayed.\nThere is uncertainty regarding the initial design and administration of the NGACO Model program.\nDue to the newness of the NGACO Model program and the fact that APAACO is the only company participating in the AIPBP track, APAACO is subject to initial program challenges including, but not limited to, process design, data and other related program aspects. APAACO has already experienced various apparent errors in the NGACO Model program and APAACO has been working with CMS, including senior CMS management, on these issues, but the resolution and impact on APAACO remains uncertain. Moreover, there is the potential for new or additional issues to be experienced with CMS which could negatively impact APAACO. Among other things, the AIPBP claims processing methodology is complex and could create reimbursement delays to contracted APAACO providers, which could cause some providers to terminate their agreements with APAACO. For example, services provided by contracted APAACO providers with Dates of Service (\u201cDOS\u201d) from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017 were to be paid by CMS. All services provided with DOS from April 1, 2017 onward were to be paid by APAACO. However, a flaw in the claims processing system of one of CMS\u2019 contractors caused payments to contracted APAACO providers to be unpaid or to be paid at a reduced rate from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017. Various providers expressed dissatisfaction about this and several decided to terminate their agreements with APAACO. Consequently, there is the actual and potential risk of damaging goodwill with APAACO\u2019s contracted providers, which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of APAACO in particularly and our results of operations and financial condition on a consolidated basis.\nAPAACO has also experienced weaknesses in the NGACO Model program beneficiary alignment methodology. For example, some patients see more than one primary care provider (\u201cPCP\u201d) in a calendar year. CMS could attribute a patient to one PCP rather than another, which could create potential liability for APAACO. For example, when APAACO sent letters to its patients, as required by CMS, it received several calls from PCPs who did not join APAACO, but whose patients were attributed to another PCP. There could also be liability where a PCP has a capitated contract with APAACO, but the PCP\u2019s patient also sees another PCP, whether that PCP was contracted with APAACO or not. APAACO\u2019s expenditures could increase due to CMS having paid an additional PCP, or to the extent that APAACO has to pay for a PCP that is not an APAACO contracted provider.\nAIPBP operations and benchmarking calculations are complex.\nAIPBP operations and benchmarking calculations are complex and can lead to errors in the application of the NGACO Model program, which could create reimbursement delays to our providers and adversely affect APAACO\u2019s performance and results of operations. For example, APAACO has discovered a feature in the AIPBP claims files that do not allow APAACO to break down certain claims amounts by individual patient codes. This feature has created confusion for APAACO contracted providers in reconciling their payments, causing some providers to terminate their agreements with APAACO. This feature could also create uncertainty with those agreements with providers that include capitation plus carve-outs for certain procedures. APAACO has sought to address its concerns about such feature with CMS and CMS has informed APAACO that CMS\u2019 contractor is unable to remedy this situation for at least the foreseeable future.\nCMS relies on multiple third-party contractors to manage the NGACO Model program, which could hinder performance.\nIn addition to CMS reliance, CMS relies on various third parties to effect the NGACO program. This may be other departments of the U.S. government, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (\u201cCMMI\u201d). CMS relies on multiple third party contractors to manage the NGACO Model program, including claims and auditing. Due to such reliance, there is the potential for errors, delays and poor communication among the differing entities involved, which are beyond the control of APAACO. This could negatively impact APAACO\u2019s results of operations specifically and our results of operations on a consolidated basis.\nThird parties used by APAACO could hinder performance.\nAPAACO uses select third parties. This could create operational and performance risk if, for example, the third party does not perform its responsibilities properly. Additionally, APAACO has contracted with participating Part A and Part B providers and was able to contract discounted Medicare, Diagnosis-Related Group and Resource Utilization Group rates with multiple providers. However, APAACO providers could decide to change or discontinue these contractual rates or to terminate their agreements with APAACO.\nRisk-sharing arrangements that MMG has with health plans and hospitals could result in their costs exceeding the corresponding revenues, which could reduce or eliminate any shared risk profitability. MMG also has a key contract with Prospect Medical Group and its management service organization, which if terminated could materially affect our business.\nUnder risk-sharing arrangements into which MMG has entered, MMG is responsible for a portion of the cost of hospital services or other services that are not capitated. These risk-sharing arrangements may require MMG to assume a portion of any loss sustained from such arrangements, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. The terms of the particular risk-sharing arrangement allocate responsibility to the respective parties when the cost of services exceeds the related revenue, which results in a deficit, or permit the parties to share in any surplus amounts when actual costs are less than the related revenue. The amount of non-capitated medical and hospital costs in any period could be affected by factors beyond the control of MMG, such as changes in treatment protocols, new technologies, longer lengths of stay by the patient, and inflation. To the extent that such non-capitated medical and hospital costs are higher than anticipated, revenue may not be sufficient to cover the risk-sharing deficits the health plans and MMG are responsible for, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf MMG is not able to satisfy DMHC requirements, MMG could become subject to sanctions and its ability to do business in California could be limited or terminated.\nThe DMHC has instituted financial solvency regulations. The regulations are intended to provide a formal mechanism for monitoring the financial solvency of a risk-bearing organization (\u201cRBO\u201d) in California, including capitated physician groups, such as MMG. Under DMHC regulations, our affiliated physician groups are required to, among other things:\n\u00b7 Maintain, at all times, a minimum \u201ccash-to-claims ratio\u201d (where \u201ccash-to-claims ratio\u201d means the organization\u2019s cash, marketable securities, and certain qualified receivables, divided by the organization\u2019s total unpaid claims liability). The regulations currently require a cash-to-claims ratio of 0.75; and\n\u00b7 Submit periodic reports to the DMHC containing various data and attestations regarding performance and financial solvency, including incurred but not reported calculations and documentation, and attestations as to whether or not the organization was in compliance with the Knox-Keene Act requirements related to claims payment timeliness, had maintained positive tangible net equity (i.e. at least $1.00), and had maintained positive working capital (i.e. at least $1.00).\nIn the event that a physician organization is not in compliance with any of the above criteria, the organization would be required to describe in a report submitted to the DMHC the reasons for non-compliance and actions to be taken to bring the organization into compliance. Additionally, under these regulations, the DMHC can make public some of the information contained in the reports, including, but not limited to, whether or not a particular physician organization met each of the criteria. In the event our affiliated physician groups are not able to meet certain of the financial solvency requirements, and fail to meet subsequent corrective action plans, our affiliated physician groups could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or removal of, its ability to do business in California.\nMMG is currently attempting to confirm that it is in compliance with certain financial requirements of the DMHC.\nOur IPA, MMG, was not in compliance with certain DMHC financial requirements, including tangible net equity (\u201cTNE\u201d). We have increased our intercompany line of credit to MMG to provide additional capital in attempt to comply partially with the DMHC\u2019s requirements. Through a plan of remediation that we presented to the DMHC and which plan it approved, we must contribute additional funds, cut costs, increase revenue or a combination of the above, which we have done. As a result of the foregoing actions we took, MMG had positive TNE as of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and has maintained positive TNE to date. Since DMHC requirements are that an RBO should have positive TNE for one full quarter to be taken off a corrective action plan (\u201cCAP\u201d), we believe that MMG is currently in compliance with DMHC requirements. The DMHC is currently reviewing filings we have made to confirm this compliance. However, there can be no assurance that MMG will remain in compliance with DMHC requirements. To the extent that we are required to contribute additional capital to MMG in the future, we would have less available cash to use on other parts of our business.\nEconomic conditions or changing consumer preferences could adversely impact our business.\nA downturn in economic conditions in one or more of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Historically, state budget limitations have resulted in reduced state spending. Given that Medicaid is a significant component of state budgets, an economic downturn would put continued cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in California. In addition, an economic downturn and/or sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing Federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by the government as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we attempt to stay informed of government and customer trends, any sustained failure to identify and respond to trends could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to adapt to a changing market and continued development of additional services.\nAlthough we expect to provide a broad and competitive range of services, there can be no assurance of acceptance by the marketplace. Our ability to procure new contracts may be dependent upon the continuing results achieved at the current facilities, upon pricing and operational considerations, and the potential need for continuing improvement to existing services. Moreover, the markets for such services may not develop as expected nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in our marketing of any such services.\nCompetition for physicians is intense, and we may not be able to hire and retain qualified physicians to provide services.\nWe are dependent on our affiliated physicians to provide services and generate revenue. We compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and other practice groups, for the services of clinicians. The limited number of residents entering the job market each year and the limited number of other licensed providers seeking to change employers makes it challenging to meet our hiring needs and may require us to contract locum tenens physicians or to increase physician compensation in a manner that decreases our profit margins. The limited number of residents and other licensed providers also impacts our ability to recruit new physicians with the expertise necessary to provide services within our business and our ability to renew contracts with existing physicians on acceptable terms. If we do not do so, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected. Even though our physician turnover rate has remained stable over at least the last three years, if the turnover rate were to increase significantly, our growth could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, unlike some of our competitors who sometimes pay additional compensation to physicians who agree to provide services exclusively to that competitor, our IPAs have historically not entered into such exclusivity agreements and have allowed our affiliated physicians to affiliate with multiple IPAs. This practice may place us at a competitive disadvantage regarding the hiring and retention of physicians relative to those competitors who do enter into such exclusivity agreements.\nThe healthcare industry continues to experience shortages in qualified service employees and management personnel, and we may be unable to hire qualified employees.\nWe compete with other healthcare providers for our employees, both clinical associates and management personnel. As the demand for health services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Furthermore, the competition for this segment of the labor market has created turnover as many seek to take advantage of the supply of available positions, many of which offer new and more attractive wage and benefit packages. In addition to the wage pressures described above, the cost of training new employees amid the turnover rates may cause added pressure on our operating margins. Lastly, the market for qualified nurses and therapists is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our palliative, home health and hospice operations, which are particularly dependent on nurses for patient care.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive.\nThere are many other companies and individuals currently providing health care services, many of which have been in business longer than we have been, and/or have substantially more financial and personnel resources than we have. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of inpatient healthcare for patients and physicians. Other companies could enter the market in the future and divert some or all of our business. On a national basis, our competitors include, but are not limited to, Team Health, EmCare, DaVita and Heritage, each of which has greater financial and other resources available to them. We also compete with physician groups and privately-owned health care companies in each of our local markets. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions, which would have an adverse impact on our growth strategy. Since there are virtually no capital expenditures required to enter the industry, there are few financial barriers to entry. Individual physicians, physician groups and companies in other healthcare industry segments, including hospitals with which we have contracts, and some of which have greater financial, marketing and staffing resources, may become competitors in providing health care services, and this competition may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive, particularly in California, where all of our operations, providers and patients are located.\nAdditionally, as we have expanded into palliative, home health and hospice care through APS, we face competitors that have traditionally concentrated in this segment and that may have greater resources and specialized expertise than we have. In many areas in which our palliative, home health and hospice care programs are located, we compete with a large number of organizations, including:\n\u00b7 community-based home health and hospice providers;\n\u00b7 national and regional companies;\n\u00b7 hospital-based home health agencies, hospice and palliative care programs; and\n\u00b7 nursing homes.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully with these competitors in palliative, home health and hospice care, and may expend significant resources without success.\nWe rely on referrals from third parties for our services.\nOur business relies in part on referrals from third parties for our services. We receive referrals from community medical providers, emergency departments, payors, and hospitals in the same manner as other medical professionals receive patient referrals. We do not provide compensation or other remuneration to our referral sources for referring patients to us. A decrease in these referrals due to competition, concerns about the quality of our services and other factors could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and adversely impact our financial condition. Similarly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain preferred provider status with significant third-party payors in the communities where we operate. If we are unable to maintain our referral base or our preferred provider status with significant third-party payors, it may negatively impact our revenues and our financial performance.\nHospitals and other inpatient and post-acute care facilities may terminate their agreements with us or reduce the fees they pay us.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, we derived approximately 49% of our net revenue for physician services from contracts directly with hospitals, other inpatient and post-acute care facilities. Our current partner facilities may decide not to renew our contracts, introduce unfavorable terms, or reduce fees paid to us. Any of these events may impact the ability of our physician practice groups to operate at such facilities, which would negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the hospitals where our affiliated physicians provide services may have their medical staff closed to non-contracted physicians.\nIn general, our affiliated physicians may only provide services in a hospital where they have certain credentials, called privileges, which are granted by the medical staff and controlled by the legally binding medical staff bylaws of the hospital. The medical staff decides who will receive privileges and the medical staff of the hospitals where we currently provide services or wish to provide services could decide that non-contracted physicians can no longer receive privileges to practice there. Such a decision would limit our ability to furnish services in a hospital, decrease the number of our affiliated physicians who could provide services or preclude us from entering new hospitals. In addition, hospitals may attempt to enter into exclusive contracts for physician services, which would reduce access to certain populations of patients within the hospital.\nWe may have difficulty collecting payments from third-party payors in a timely manner.\nWe derive significant revenue from third-party payors, and delays in payment or audits leading to refunds to payors may adversely impact our net revenue. We assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed payments. In particular, we rely on some key governmental payors. Governmental payors typically pay on a more extended payment cycle, which could result in our incurring expenses prior to receiving corresponding revenue. In the current healthcare environment, payors are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare, including proposals to revise coverage and reimbursement policies. We may experience difficulties in collecting revenue because third-party payors may seek to reduce or delay payment to which we believe we are entitled. If we are not paid fully and in a timely manner for such services or there is a finding that we were incorrectly paid, our revenues, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDecreases in payor rates could adversely affect us.\nDecreases in payor rates, either prospectively or retroactively, could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue, cash flow and results of operations. For example, during fiscal 2016, Health Net, Inc. reduced payor rates to their payees, including us, retroactive to July 1, 2015 and LA Care reduced payor rates to their payees, including us, retroactive to January 1, 2016.\nOur business model depends on numerous complex management information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could undermine our ability to receive ACO payments and otherwise materially harm our operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nWe depend on a complex, specialized, integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for our billing operations. We may be unable to enhance our existing management information systems or implement new management information systems where necessary. Additionally, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications or expenses in implementing, integrating and operating our systems. Our management information systems may require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist us in creating and implementing these systems. Our failure to successfully implement and maintain all of our systems could undermine our ability to receive MSSP payments and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our failure to successfully operate our billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nIn the recent past, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, which we have remediated. However, we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be not recur or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could lead to a decline in our stock price, or result in action against us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In the recent past, we have identified a number of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses could have allowed the reporting of inaccurate or incomplete information regarding our business in our public filings and have required us to devote substantial resources to mitigating and resolving the weaknesses we have identified. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will not recur or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.\nAdditionally, we intend to continue to grow our business, in part, through the acquisition of new entities and the consummation of the Merger. If and when we acquire such existing entities, or consummate the Merger, our due diligence may fail to discover defects or deficiencies in the design and operations of the internal controls over financial reporting of such entities, or defects or deficiencies in the internal controls over financial reporting may arise when we try to integrate the operations of these newly acquired companies with our own. We can provide no assurances that we will not experience such issues in future acquisitions, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nThe requirements of remaining a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these requirements are time-consuming and expensive, creating pressure on our financial resources and, accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time we may be required to write-off intangible assets, such as goodwill, due to impairment.\nOur intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Under current accounting standards, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and we may be subject to impairment losses as circumstances change after an acquisition. If we record an impairment loss related to our goodwill, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded.\nWe currently derive 100% of our revenues in California and are vulnerable to changes in California healthcare laws and regulations.\nOur business and operations are located in one state, California. Any material changes by California with respect to strategy, taxation and economics of healthcare delivery, reimbursements, financial requirements or other aspects of regulation of the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA prolonged disruption of the capital and/or credit markets may adversely affect our future access to capital, our cost of capital and our ability to continue operations.\nWe have relied substantially on the capital and credit markets for liquidity and to execute our business strategies, which includes a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Volatility and disruption of the U.S. capital and credit markets may adversely affect our access to capital and/or increase our cost of capital. Should current economic and market conditions deteriorate, our ability to finance our ongoing operations and our expansion may be adversely affected, we may be unable to raise necessary funds, our cost of debt or equity capital may increase significantly if we are able to raise capital, and future access to capital markets may be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to use a significant amount of cash on hand and/or raise capital if we are required to repay the holder of our $4,990,000 convertible note.\nOn March 30, 3017, we issued a Convertible Promissory Note to Alliance Apex, LLC (\u201cAlliance\u201d) for $4.99 million (the \u201cAlliance Note\u201d). The Alliance Note is due and payable to Alliance on (i) December 31, 2017, or (ii) the date on which the Merger is terminated, whichever occurs first (\u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Upon the closing, on or before the Maturity Date, of the Merger, the Alliance Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest, shall automatically be converted (a \u201cMandatory Conversion\u201d) into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and other similar recapitalization transactions that occur after the date of the Alliance Note. If the Merger is not consummated, we will be obligated to repay the Alliance Note, which would require a significant amount of cash on hand or the need to raise capital to pay off or refinance the Alliance Note. There can be no assurance that is such event arose, we would have sufficient cash on hand to repay the Alliance Note or could raise capital on favorable terms, or at all, to repay the Alliance Note.\t\nUncertain or adverse economic conditions may have a negative impact on our industry, business, results of operations or financial position.\nUncertain or adverse economic conditions could have a negative effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations and/or financial position. These conditions could have a negative impact on our industry. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material adverse effect on our business as a result of future economic conditions or that the actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve or other governmental and regulatory bodies, for the purpose of stimulating the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect. Additionally, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, our customers or our financial condition, results of operations or the price of our securities. Potential consequences of the foregoing include:\n\u00b7 our ability to issue equity and/or borrow capital on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could limit our ability to access capital;\n\u00b7 potential increased costs of borrowing capital if interest rates rise;\n\u00b7 adverse terms imposed on us by any equity investor;\n\u00b7 the possible impairment of some or all of the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n\u00b7 the possibility that any then-existing lenders could refuse to fund any commitment to us or could fail, and we may not be able to replace or refinance the financing commitment of any such lender on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nActual or perceived difficulties in the global capital and credit markets have adversely affected, and uncertain or adverse economic conditions may negatively affect, our business. Ongoing uncertain economic conditions may affect our financial performance or our ability to forecast our business with accuracy.\nOur operations and performance depend primarily on California and U.S. economic conditions and their impact on purchases of, or capitated rates for, our delivery of healthcare services. As a result of the global financial crisis that began in 2008, which was experienced on a broad and extensive scope and scale, and the last recession in the United States, general economic conditions deteriorated significantly, and, although the markets have improved significantly, the overall economic recovery since that time has been uneven. Declines in consumer and business confidence and private as well as government spending during and since the last recession, together with significant reductions in the availability and increases in the cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit markets, as well as government budgeting, have adversely affected the business and economic environment in which we operate and can affect the profitability of our business. Our business is significantly exposed to risks associated with government spending and private payor reimbursement rates. Economic conditions may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We believe that this general economic uncertainty may continue in future periods, as our patients, private payors and government payors alter their purchasing activities in response to the new economic reality, and, among other things, our patients may change or scale back healthcare spending, and private and government payors could reduce reimbursement rates, which we have experienced. Additional consequences of such adverse effects could include the delay or cancellation of consumer spending for discretionary and non-reimbursed healthcare. Future disruption of the credit markets, increases in interest rates and/or sluggish economic growth in future periods could adversely affect our patients\u2019 spending habits, private payors\u2019 access to capital (which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses) and governmental budgetary processes, and, in turn, could result in reduced revenue to us. The continuation or recurrence of any of these conditions may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. This uncertainty may also affect our ability to prepare accurate financial forecasts or meet specific forecasted results. If we are unable to adequately respond to or forecast further changes in demand for healthcare services, our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of our agreements with hospitals and medical groups are relatively short term or may be terminated without cause by providing advance notice, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, operations and future business plans.\nMany of our hospitalist and other operating agreements are relatively short term or may be terminated without cause by providing advance notice. If these agreements are terminated before the end of their terms, at the end of their term or are not renewed, we would lose the revenue generated by those agreements. Any such terminations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and future business plans.\nMany of our agreements with hospitals and medical groups include prohibitions against our hiring physicians or patients or competing with the hospital or medical group, which limits our ability to implement our business plan in certain areas.\nBecause many of our hospitalist and other operating agreements include prohibitions on our hiring physicians or patients or competing with the hospital or medical group, our ability to hire physicians, attract patients or conduct business in certain areas may be limited in some cases.\nIf there is a change in accounting principles or the interpretation thereof by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) affecting consolidation of VIEs, it could impact our consolidation of total revenues derived from such affiliated physician groups.\nOur financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and various non-owned affiliated physician groups that are VIEs, which consolidation is effectuated in accordance with applicable accounting rules. In the event of a change in accounting principles promulgated by FASB or in FASB\u2019s interpretation of its principles, or if there were an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court or a change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with such physician groups, we may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the total revenues of such organizations.\nAccounting rules require that under some circumstances the VIE consolidation model be applied when a reporting enterprise holds a variable interest (e.g., equity interests, debt obligations, certain management and service contracts) in a legal entity. Under this model, an enterprise must assess the entity in which it holds a variable interest to determine whether it meets the criteria to be consolidated as a VIE. If the entity is a VIE, the consolidation framework next identifies the party, if one exists, that possesses a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires that party to consolidate as the primary beneficiary. An enterprise\u2019s determination of whether it has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires that a qualitative determination be made, and is not solely based on voting rights.\nIf an enterprise determines the entity in which it holds a variable interest is not subject to the VIE guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 810, the enterprise should apply the traditional voting control model (also outlined in ASC 810) which focuses on voting rights. In our case, the VIE consolidation model applies to our controlled, but not owned, physician affiliated entities. Our determination regarding the consolidation of our affiliates could be challenged, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nThe healthcare industry is complex and intensely regulated at the federal, state, and local levels and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations.\nAs a company involved in providing healthcare services, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. There are significant costs involved in complying with these laws and regulations. Moreover, if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal damages, fines, sanctions or penalties, including exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We may also be required to change our method of operations. These consequences could be the result of current conduct or even conduct that occurred a number of years ago. We also could incur significant costs merely if we become the subject of an investigation or legal proceeding alleging a violation of these laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether a federal, state or local government will determine that we are not operating in accordance with law, or whether, when or how the laws will change in the future and impact our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more significant healthcare laws and regulations that affect us:\n\u00b7 federal laws, including the federal False Claims Act, that provide for penalties against entities and individuals which knowingly or recklessly make claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs, as well as third-party payors, that contain or are based upon false or fraudulent information;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cAnti-Kickback Statute,\u201d that prohibits the knowing and willful offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral or recommendation of patients for items and services covered, in or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law or physician self-referral law, that (subject to limited exceptions) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to an entity for the provision of specific \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of such physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity, and prohibits the entity from billing for services arising out of such prohibited referrals;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act that provides for criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose known overpayments;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act that provides for civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers who fail to repay known overpayments within 60 days of identification or the date any corresponding cost report was due, if applicable, and also allows improper retention of known overpayments to serve as a basis for False Claims Act violations;\n\u00b7 state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, which typically are not limited to relationships involving governmental payors;\n\u00b7 provisions of, and regulations relating to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) that provide penalties for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a health-care benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 provisions of HIPAA and HITECH limiting how covered entities, business associates and business associate sub-contractors may use and disclose PHI and the security measures that must be taken in connection with protecting that information and related systems, as well as similar or more stringent state laws;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws that provide penalties for providers for billing and receiving payment from a governmental healthcare program for services unless the services are medically necessary and reasonable, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;\n\u00b7 federal laws that provide for administrative sanctions, including civil monetary penalties for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federal healthcare programs, payments by hospitals to physicians for reducing or limiting services to Medicare or Medicaid patients, or employing or contracting with individuals or entities who/which are excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to enroll in the Medicare and Medicaid programs before submitting any claims for services, to promptly report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs, and to re-enroll in these programs when changes in direct or indirect ownership occur or in response to revalidation requests from Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 state laws that prohibit general business entities from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians;\n\u00b7 laws in some states that prohibit non-domiciled entities from owning and operating medical practices in their states;\n\u00b7 provisions of the Social Security Act (emanating from the DRA) that require entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5 million or more from a single Medicaid program to provide their employees, contractors and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state false claims acts and related statutes, that establish a new Medicaid Integrity Program designed to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse, and that increase financial incentives for both states and individuals to bring fraud and abuse claims against healthcare companies; and\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and regulations restricting the techniques that may be used to collect past due accounts from consumers, such as our patients, for services provided to the consumer.\nWe cannot predict the effect that the ACA and its implementation, amendment, or repeal and replacement, may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe continued implementation of provisions of the ACA, the adoption of new regulations thereunder and ongoing legal challenges create an uncertain environment for how the ACA may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHowever, some of the reductions in Medicare spending, such as negative adjustments to the Medicare hospital inpatient and outpatient prospective payment system market basket updates and the incorporation of productivity adjustments to the Medicare program\u2019s annual inflation updates, became effective starting in 2010. Although the expansion of health insurance coverage should increase revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals, many of these provisions of the ACA, as currently provided, will continue to become effective beyond 2017, and the impact of such expansion may be gradual and may not offset scheduled decreases in reimbursement.\nOn June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, including the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provisions of the ACA that generally require all individuals to obtain healthcare insurance or pay a penalty. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the provision of the ACA that authorized the HHS Secretary to penalize states that choose not to participate in the expansion of the Medicaid program by removing all of their existing Medicaid funding was unconstitutional. In response to the ruling, a number of U.S. governors opposed their state\u2019s participation in the expanded Medicaid program, which resulted in the ACA not providing coverage to some low-income persons in those states. In addition, several bills have been, and are continuing to be, introduced in Congress to amend all or significant provisions of the ACA, or repeal and replace the ACA with another law.\nThe ACA changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. The net effect of the ACA on our business is subject to numerous variables, including the law\u2019s complexity, lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation or possible amendment, as well as the uncertainty as to the extent to which states will choose to participate in the expanded Medicaid program.\nThe Health Care Reform Acts mandated changes specific to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the Health Care Reform Acts mandated the creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal year 2014 that will be phased-in over a four-year period, and a reduction in the outlier cap. In addition, the Health Care Reform Acts require the HHS Secretary to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. They also require the HHS Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with specific conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Health Care Reform Acts further direct the HHS Secretary to rebase payments for home health, which will result in a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning in 2014 that is being phased-in over a four-year period. The HHS Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate cost and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress. Beginning October 1, 2012, the annual market basket rate increase for hospice providers was reduced by a formula that caused payment rates to be lower than in the prior year.\nThe impact that changes in healthcare laws could have on us is uncertain but could be material.\nDespite the enactment of the ACA and its being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court as constitutional, continuing legal and political challenges to specific parts of the ACA have added uncertainty about the current state of healthcare laws in the United States. This uncertainty has intensified following the 2016 President election and the publicly announced intention of the leadership of the majority in the 115th Congress to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the ACA, related Health Care Reform Acts and possibly other healthcare laws, and of the Administration to seek to have regulators amend or rescind certain regulations thereunder.\nIt is impossible to know what impact such efforts, assuming they are successful, will have on us. However, any changes in healthcare laws or regulations that reduce, curtail or eliminate payments, government-subsidized programs, government-sponsored programs, and/or the expansion of Medicare or Medicaid, among other actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nJust as the fate of the ACA is uncertain, so is the future of ACOs, which were established under the ACA to improve care and reduce costs. We operate an ACO and have been approved by CMS to operate an ACO under the NGACO Model. Under the MSSP and NGACO programs and pursuant to the Participation Agreement we have entered into with CMS for our NGACO Model, our ACO operations will always be subject to the nation\u2019s healthcare laws, as amended, repealed or replaced from time to time.\nIt is impossible to know what impact such \u2018repeal and replace\u201d or similar efforts, assuming they are successful, will have on us. However, any changes in healthcare laws or regulations that reduce, curtail or eliminate payments, reimbursements, government-subsidized programs, government-sponsored programs, and/or the expansion of Medicare or Medicaid, among other actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProviders in the healthcare industry are sometimes the subject of federal and state investigations, as well as payor audits.\nDue to our participation in government and private healthcare programs, we are sometimes involved in inquiries, reviews, audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. Federal and state government agencies have active civil and criminal enforcement efforts that include investigations of healthcare companies, and their executives and managers. Under some circumstances, these investigations can also be initiated by private individuals under whistleblower provisions which may be incentivized by the possibility for private recoveries. The Deficit Reduction Act revised federal law to further encourage these federal, state and individually-initiated investigations against healthcare companies.\nResponding to these audit and enforcement activities can be costly and disruptive to our business operations, even when the allegations are without merit. If we are subject to an audit or investigation and a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed, we may be required to repay these agencies or private payors, or we may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payment for the services we provide. We also may be subject to other financial sanctions or be required to modify our operations.\nControls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.\nControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization review\u201d, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our operations. Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost on a post-discharge basis. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. The ACA potentially expands the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use, and, as a result, efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations and other third-party payors. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by third party payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nLaws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require a corporate restructuring.\nSome states have laws that prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in some arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. California is one of the states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine.\nIn California, we operate by maintaining contracts with our affiliated physician groups which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide physician services. Under these arrangements, we provide management services, receive a management fee for providing non-medical management services, do not represent that we offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the affiliated physician groups.\nIn addition to the above management arrangements, we have some contractual rights relating to the transfer of equity interests in some of our affiliated physician groups to a nominee shareholder designated by us, through physician shareholder agreements, with Dr. Hosseinion, the controlling equity holder of such affiliated physician groups. However, such equity interests cannot be transferred to or held by us or by any non-professional organization. Accordingly, we do not directly own any equity interests in any physician groups in California. In the event that any of these affiliated physician groups fails to comply with the management arrangement or any management arrangement is terminated and/or we are unable to enforce its contractual rights over the orderly transfer of equity interests in its affiliated physician groups, or California law is interpreted to invalidate these arrangements, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur palliative care business is subject to rules, prohibitions, regulations and reimbursement requirements that differ from those that govern our primary home health and hospice operations.\nWe continue to develop our palliative care services, which is a type of care focused upon relieving pain and suffering in patients who do not quality for, or who have not yet elected, hospice services. The continued development of this business line exposes us to additional risks, in part because the business line requires us to comply with additional Federal and state laws and regulations that differ from those that govern our home health and hospice business. This line of business requires compliance with different Federal and state requirements governing licensure, enrollment, documentation, prescribing, coding, billing and collection of coinsurance and deductibles, among other requirements. Additionally, some states have prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, which generally prohibit business entities from owning or controlling medical practices or may limit the ability of clinical professionals to share professional service income with non-professional or business interests. Reimbursement for palliative care and house calls services is generally conditioned on our clinical professionals providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service itself and the medical necessity for the service. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information, or the incorrect selection of codes for the level and type of service provided, could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. Further, compliance with applicable regulations may cause us to incur expenses that we have not anticipated, and if we are unable to comply with these additional legal requirements, we may incur liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur palliative care business line is subject to new licensing requirements, which will require us to expend resources to comply with the changing requirements.\nIn October 2013, California enacted the Home Care Services Consumer Protection Act. The act establishes a licensing program for home care organizations, and requires background checks, basic training and tuberculosis screening for the aides that are employed by home care organizations. Home care organizations and aides had until January 1, 2015 to comply with the new licensing and background check requirements. Because we operate in California, the requirements of the act are expected to impose additional costs on us.\nWe do not have a limited Knox-Keene license.\nWe do not hold a limited Knox-Keene license, which is a managed care plan license in California. If the DMHC were to determine that we have been inappropriately taking risk for institutional and professional services as a result of our various hospital and physician arrangements without having a limited Knox-Keene license, we may be required to obtain a limited Knox-Keene license to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by the failure of our affiliated physicians to appropriately document services they provide.\nWe rely upon our affiliated physicians to appropriately and accurately complete necessary medical record documentation and assign appropriate reimbursement codes for their services. Reimbursement to us is conditioned upon, in part, our affiliated physicians providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided and the medical necessity for the services. If our affiliated physicians have provided incorrect or incomplete documentation or selected inaccurate reimbursement codes, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors and result in recoupments or refund demands, affecting revenue already received.\nChanges associated with reimbursement by third-party payors for the Company\u2019s services may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe medical services industry is undergoing significant changes with government and other third-party payors that are taking measures to reduce reimbursement rates or, in some cases, denying reimbursement altogether. There is no assurance that government or other third-party payors will continue to pay for the services provided by our affiliated medical groups. Furthermore, there has been, and continues to be, a great deal of discussion and debate about the repeal and replacement of existing government reimbursement programs, such as the ACA. As a result, the future of healthcare reimbursement programs is uncertain, making long-term business planning difficult and imprecise. The failure of government or other third party payors to cover adequately the medical services provided by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with federal and state privacy and information security laws is expensive, and we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches.\nWe must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and confidentiality of patient health information (\u201cPHI\u201d), including HIPAA and HITECH. As part of our medical record keeping, third-party billing, and other services, we collect and maintain PHI in paper and electronic format. Therefore, new privacy or security laws, whether implemented pursuant to federal or state action, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle healthcare-related data and communicate with payors. In addition, compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us. Despite our efforts to prevent security and privacy breaches, they may still occur. If any non-compliance with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI results in privacy or security breaches, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or even criminal sanctions.\nAs a result of the expanded scope of HIPAA through HITECH, we may incur significant costs in order to minimize the amount of \u201cunsecured PHI\u201d we handle and retain or to implement improved administrative, technical or physical safeguards to protect PHI. We may incur significant costs in order to demonstrate and document whether there is a low probability that PHI has been compromised in order to overcome the presumption that an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI results in a reportable breach. We may incur significant costs to notify the relevant individuals, government entities and, in some cases, the media, in the event of a breach and to provide appropriate remediation and monitoring to mitigate the possible damage done by any such breach.\nProviders must be properly enrolled in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, before they can receive reimbursement for providing services, and there may be delays in the enrollment process.\nEach time a new affiliated physician joins us, we must enroll the affiliated physician under our applicable group identification number for Medicare and Medicaid programs and for certain managed care and private insurance programs before we can receive reimbursement for services the physician renders to beneficiaries of those programs. The estimated time to receive approval for the enrollment is sometimes difficult to predict and, in recent years, the Medicare program carriers often have not issued these numbers to our affiliated physicians in a timely manner. These practices result in delayed reimbursement that may adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe may face malpractice and other lawsuits that may not be covered by insurance.\nMalpractice lawsuits are common in the healthcare industry. The medical malpractice legal environment varies greatly by state. The status of tort reform, availability of non-economic damages or the presence or absence of other statutes, such as elder abuse or vulnerable adult statutes, influence the incidence and severity of malpractice litigation. We may also be subject to other types of lawsuits which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Many states have joint and several liabilities for all healthcare providers who deliver care to a patient and are at least partially liable. As a result, if one healthcare provider is found liable for medical malpractice for the provision of care to a particular patient, all other healthcare providers who furnished care to that same patient, including possibly our affiliated physicians, may also share in the liability, which may be substantial.\nWe currently maintain malpractice liability insurance coverage to cover professional liability and other claims for certain hospitalists and clinic physicians. All of our physicians are required to carry first dollar coverage with limits of coverage equal to $1,000,000 for all claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3,000,000 per year. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us, our affiliated professional organizations or our affiliated physicians, and we cannot provide assurance that any future liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our professional liability insurance coverage generally must be renewed annually and may not continue to be available to us in future years at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.\nWe have established reserves for potential medical liabilities losses which are subject to inherent uncertainties and a deficiency in the established reserves may lead to a reduction in our net income.\nWe establish reserves for estimates of IBNR due to contracted physicians, hospitals, and other professional providers and risk-pool liabilities. IBNR estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of health care services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. Many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. Such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation. The inherent difficulty in interpreting contracts and the estimated level of necessary reserves could result in significant fluctuations in our estimates from period to period. It is possible that actual losses and related expenses may differ, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If subsequent claims exceed our estimated reserves, we may be required to increase reserves, which would lead to a reduction in our assets or net income.\nLitigation expenses may be material.\nThe defense of litigation, including fees of legal counsel, expert witnesses and related costs, is expensive and difficult to forecast accurately. In general, such costs are unrecoverable even if we ultimately prevail in litigation and could represent a significant portion of our limited capital resources. To defend lawsuits, it is also necessary for us to divert officers and other employees from their normal business functions to gather evidence, give testimony and otherwise support litigation efforts. We expect to experience higher than normal litigation costs until the lawsuits by our competitor are decided.\nIf we lose any material litigation, we could face material judgments or awards against us. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of the proceedings in which we are involved now or in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe may also in the future find it necessary to file lawsuits to recover damages or protect our interests. The cost of such litigation could also be significant and unrecoverable, which may also deter us from aggressively pursuing even legitimate claims.\nWe may be subject to litigation related to the agreements that our IPAs enter into with primary care physicians.\nIt is common in the medical services industry for primary care physicians to be affiliated with multiple IPAs. Our IPAs often enter into agreements with physicians who are also affiliated with our competitors. However, some of our competitors at times enter into agreements with physicians that require the physician to provide services exclusively to that competitor. Our IPAs often have no knowledge, and no way of knowing, whether a physician seeking to affiliate with us is subject to an exclusivity agreement unless the physician informs us of that agreement. Our IPAs rely on the physicians seeking to affiliate with us to determine whether they are able to enter into the proposed agreement. Competitors have initiated lawsuits against us based in part on interference with such exclusivity agreements, and may do so in the future. An adverse outcome in one or more of such lawsuits could adversely affect our business, assets, cash flow and financial condition.\nChanges in the rates or methods of Medicare reimbursements may adversely affect our operations.\nIn order to participate in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. These programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, meaning that generally we cannot increase our revenue by increasing the amount we charge for our services. To the extent that our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare reimbursement for various services. In April of 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) was signed into law, which made numerous changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and other healthcare related programs. These changes include new systems for establishing the annual updates to payment rates for physicians\u2019 services in Medicare. Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by MACRA and any changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at or having the effect of reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare, TRICARE (which provides civilian health benefits for U.S Armed Forces military personnel, military retirees, and their dependents) and other government healthcare programs.\nOur business also could be adversely affected by reductions in, or limitations of, reimbursement amounts or rates under these government programs, reductions in funding of these programs or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs.\nOverall payments made by Medicare for hospice services are subject to cap amounts. Total Medicare payments to us for hospice services are compared to the cap amount for the hospice cap period, which runs from November 1 of one year through October 31 of the next year. CMS generally announces the cap amount in the month of July or August in the cap period and not at the beginning of the cap period. Accordingly, we must estimate the cap amount for the cap period before CMS announces the cap amount. If our estimate exceeds the later announced cap amount, we may suffer losses. CMS can also make retroactive adjustments to cap amounts announced for prior cap periods, in which case payments to us in excess of the cap amount must be returned to Medicare. A second hospice cap amount limits the number of days of inpatient care to not more than 20 percent of total patient care days within the cap period.\nIn addition, the Health Care Reform Acts includes several provisions that could adversely impact hospice providers, including a provision to reduce the annual market basket update for hospice providers by a productivity adjustment. We cannot predict whether any healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented, or whether the Health Care Reform Acts or other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system will adversely affect our revenues. Further, due to budgetary concerns, several states have considered or are considering reducing or eliminating the Medicaid hospice benefit. Reductions or changes in Medicare or Medicaid funding could significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and our profitability.\nIf we inadvertently employ or contract with an excluded person, we may face government sanctions.\nIndividuals and entities can be excluded from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violating certain laws and regulations, or for other reasons such as the loss of a license in any state, even if the individual retains other licensure. This means that they (and all others) are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, and if the excluded individual is a physician, all services ordered (not just provided) by such physician are also non-covered and non-payable. Entities which employ or contract with excluded individuals are prohibited from billing the Medicare or Medicaid programs for the excluded individual\u2019s services, and are subject to civil monetary penalties if they do. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) maintains a list of excluded individuals and entities. Although we have instituted policies and procedures through our compliance program to minimize the risks, there can be no assurance that we will not inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or that any of our current employees or contracts will not become excluded in the future without our knowledge. If this occurs, we may be subject to substantial repayments and civil penalties, and the hospitals at which we furnish services also may be subject to repayments and sanctions, for which they may seek recovery from us.\nWe may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.\nDue to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors or the uninsured may result in a reduction in our rates of reimbursement or an increase in our uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in our net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain with private insurance, changes in those programs could increase patient responsibility amounts, resulting in a greater risk for us of uncollectible receivables. Further, our hospice related business could become subject to \u201cquality star ratings\u201d and, if sufficient quality is not achieved, reimbursement could be negatively impacted. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal and state laws may limit our effectiveness at collecting monies owed to us from patients.\nWe utilize third parties, whom we do not and cannot control, to collect from patients any co-payments and other payments for services that our physicians provide to patients. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the \u201cFDCPA\u201d) restricts the methods that third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. State laws vary with respect to debt collection practices, although most state requirements are similar to those under the FDCPA. If our collection practices or those of our collection agencies are inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to actual damages and penalties. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, including changes to laws and regulations regarding or affecting healthcare reform or the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed.\nDue to the importance of the healthcare industry in the lives of all Americans, federal, state, and local legislative bodies frequently pass legislation and promulgate regulations relating to healthcare reform or that affect the healthcare industry. As has been the trend in recent years, it is reasonable to assume that there will continue to be increased federal oversight and regulation of the healthcare industry in the future. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of any new healthcare legislation or regulations, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential new legislation or regulations on our business. It is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures, or regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities at the Federal or state level, could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of the hospitals and other facilities where our physicians provide services. It is possible that the changes to the Medicare or other governmental healthcare program reimbursements may serve as precedent to possible changes in other payors\u2019 reimbursement policies in a manner averse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursements could lead to adverse changes in Medicare and other governmental healthcare programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs to adopt certain provisions under HITECH.\nHITECH was enacted into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among the many provisions of HITECH are those relating to the implementation and use of certified electronic health records (\u201cEHR\u201d). Our patient medical records are maintained and under the custodianship of the healthcare facilities in which we operate. However, to adopt the use of EHRs utilized by these healthcare facilities, determine to adopt certain EHRs, or comply with any related provisions of HITECH, we may incur significant costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position.\nThe healthcare industry is becoming increasingly reliant on use of technology.\nThe role of technology is greatly increasing in the delivery of healthcare, which provides risk to traditional physician-driven healthcare delivery companies such as ours. We need to understand and integrate with electronic health records, databases, cloud-based billing systems and many other technology applications in the delivery of our services. Additionally, consumers are using mobile applications and care and cost research in selecting and usage of healthcare services. We rely on employees and third parties with technology knowledge and expertise and could be at risk if resources are not properly established, maintained or secured.\nWe may be exposed to cybersecurity risks.\nWhile we have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents, the nature of our business and the requirements of healthcare privacy laws such as HIPAA and HITECH, impose significant obligations on us to maintain the privacy and protection of patient medical information. Any cybersecurity incident could expose us to violations of HIPAA and/or HITECH that, even unintended, could cause significant financial exposure to us in the form of fines and costs of remediation of any such incident.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock is thinly traded, the market price of our common stock is volatile, and the value of your investment could fluctuate, and decline, significantly.\nOur stock is thinly traded. In part because of that, and for other reasons, the trading price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our results of operations, our financial situation, the announcement and consummation of certain transactions, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital and the terms on which we raise capital and trading volume. Other factors include:\n\u00b7 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 developments in the hospitalists markets;\n\u00b7 announcements of acquisitions dispositions and other corporate level transactions;\n\u00b7 announcements of financings and other capital raising transactions;\n\u00b7 sales of stock by our stockholders generally and our larger stockholders in particular;\n\u00b7 general inefficiencies of trading on junior markets or quotations systems, including the need to comply on a state-by-state basis with state \u201cblue sky\u201d securities laws for the resale of our common stock on OTC Pink; and\n\u00b7 general stock market and economic conditions.\nThere has been a limited trading market for our common stock to date.\nThere has been limited trading volume in our common stock, which is quoted on OTC Pink under the trading symbol \u201cAMEH\u201d. It is anticipated that there will continue to be a limited trading market for our common stock on OTC Pink and it is often difficult to obtain accurate price quotes for our stock on OTC Pink. A lack of an active market may impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell shares at the time they wish to sell shares or at a price that our stockholders consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of our common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using common stock as consideration.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe have issued some of our directors, officers, other employees, consultants, lenders and other third parties securities, including options, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt, that such parties may exercise or convert into shares of our common stock. Such conversions or exercises would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, resulting in dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders.\nMoreover, we may in the future issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in further dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes. For example, we will have to issue additional shares of common stock to NNA if we fail to comply with NNA\u2019s registration rights.\nThe future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are currently traded at such time.\nDelaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of us by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to our stockholders.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of us, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Delaware law imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d. These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation empowers the Board of Directors to establish and issue one or more classes of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the Board of Directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock.\nIn the past, our common stock has been subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and it could become subject to that rule again. Additionally, trading in our securities is very limited, which makes transactions in our common stock cumbersome, increases stock price volatility and may reduce the value of an investment in our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. During the last 52 weeks, our common stock has traded at both below and above $5.00 per share. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act requires:\n\u00b7 a broker or dealer to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7 a broker or dealer receives a written agreement for the transaction from the investor, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u00b7 obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u00b7 make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, among other things:\n\u00b7 sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7 that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to purchase or sell our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock or underscore our stock\u2019s volatility in the market.\nAdditionally, our common stock is relatively thinly traded and on a number of days there are no market transactions in our common stock. This could contribute to stock price volatility or supply/demand imbalances that could adversely affect the price of our common stock from time to time, making an investment in our common stock less attractive to certain investors.", "PERMNO": 17133, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "AMEH"}
