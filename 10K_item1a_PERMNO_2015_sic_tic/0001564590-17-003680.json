You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. For additional information, see \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nSince our inception in January 2006, we have incurred a significant net loss. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $404.6 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our equity securities, debt financing with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliated funds, or Capital Royalty Partners, and sales of our products. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the commercialization of our products, the scaling of our manufacturing operations and commercial organization, the research and development of our current products and products under development, and the assembly of a management team to manage our business.\nWe began commercial sales of our first commercial product, t:slim, in the third quarter of 2012. We began commercial sales of t:flex in the second quarter of 2015 and t:slim G4 in the third quarter of 2015. In October 2016, we discontinued new shipments of t:slim and launched t:slim X2, our next-generation flagship pump. Since the first quarter of 2013, we have been able to manufacture and sell our insulin pump products at a cost and in volumes sufficient to allow us to achieve a positive overall gross margin. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our gross profit was $23.6 million and $26.6 million, respectively. Although we have achieved a positive overall gross margin, we still operate at a significant net loss and expect that we will continue to do so for the next several years.\nTo implement our business strategy we need to, among other things, increase sales and gross profits of our products, maintain an appropriate customer service and support infrastructure, fund ongoing research and development activities, improve and expand our manufacturing capabilities, and obtain regulatory clearance or approval to commercialize our products currently under development. Our expenses may to continue to increase as we pursue these objectives and make investments in our business. Additional increases in our expenses without commensurate increases in sales could significantly increase our operating losses.\nThe extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain in light of a number of factors, including the timing of the launch of new products and product features by us and our competitors, market acceptance of our products and competitive products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers, and the timing of regulatory approval of new products. In addition, our implementation of the Technology Upgrade Program makes forecasting our operating results more difficult, because such forecasts depend on customer behavioral assumptions, such as the likelihood that the trade-in rights will actually be exercised and the timing of any such decisions. Any additional operating losses will have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity, and we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe currently rely on sales of insulin pumps to generate a significant portion of our revenue, and any factors that negatively impact sales of our insulin pump products may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe generate a significant majority of our revenue from the sale of our insulin pump products, which currently include our t:slim X2, t:flex and t:slim G4 products. Sales of our insulin pumps may be negatively impacted by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe potential that other technological breakthroughs for the monitoring, treatment or prevention of diabetes may render our insulin pump products obsolete or less desirable;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our insulin pump products or similar products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our Tandem Device Updater to accurately and timely provide customers with remote access to new product features and functionality as anticipated, or our failure to obtain regulatory approval for any such updates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in reimbursement rates or policies relating to insulin pumps or similar products or technologies by third-party payors, such as the decision by UnitedHealthcare during 2016 that restricted a majority of their members from accessing our pumps;\n\u25cf\nour inability to enter into contracts with third-party payors on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;\n\u25cf\nproblems arising from the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, or destruction, loss, or temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facility; and\n\u25cf\nclaims that any of our insulin pump products, or any component thereof or related supplies, infringes on patent rights or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn addition, sales of any of our current or future insulin pump products with CGM integration are subject to the continuation of our applicable agreements with DexCom, which under some circumstances are subject to termination by DexCom, with or without cause, on relatively short notice.\nFurthermore, sales of our products may be adversely impacted by negative perceptions regarding our financial stability relative to that of our competitors, and our ability to sustain our business operations on a long-term basis. These perceptions may cause people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers, as well as independent distributors and third-party payors, to question our ability to continue to sell our products, provide customer service, support our commercial organization, and fulfill our strategic objectives. These concerns may arise from a number of factors, including our recent financial results, recent changes in our stock price, our current level of indebtedness, recent or anticipated competitive product launches, the impact of the Technology Upgrade Program, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment. Any such concerns, whether actual or perceived, could cause consumers to delay the purchase of our products or to purchase competitive products.\nBecause we currently rely on sales of our insulin pump products to generate a significant majority of our revenue, any factors that negatively impact sales of these products, or result in sales of these products increasing at a lower rate than expected, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, and negatively impact our ability to successfully launch future products currently under development.\nWe operate in a very competitive industry and if we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, many of whom have greater resources than us, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, treatment techniques or technologies, or other activities of industry participants. We believe our products compete, and will continue to compete, directly with a number of traditional insulin pumps as well as other methods for the treatment of diabetes, including MDI therapy.\nOur primary competitors are major medical device companies that are either publicly traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies. For instance, Medtronic MiniMed, a division of Medtronic, Inc., has been the market leader for many years and has the majority share of the traditional insulin pump market in the United States. Other significant insulin pump suppliers in the United States include Animas Corporation, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and Insulet Corporation. However, the market for insulin pumps is currently undergoing significant changes. For instance, in late 2016, Roche Diabetes Care, a division of F. Hoffman-La Roche discontinued sales of new insulin pumps in the United States, and in early 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced that it is evaluating strategic options for its diabetes business unit, including Animas. It is too early to evaluate the potential impact of these changes on our competitive landscape. There are also newer companies entering the field.\nSome of our competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u25cf\ngreater financial and human resources for sales and marketing, product development, customer service and clinical resources;\n\u25cf\ngreater financial resources to respond to competitive pressures and regulatory uncertainty;\n\u25cf\nestablished relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors;\n\u25cf\nestablished reputation and name recognition among healthcare providers and other key opinion leaders in the diabetes industry;\n\u25cf\nin some cases, greater market share and established base of customers;\n\u25cf\nproducts supported by long-term clinical data;\n\u25cf\nlarger and more established distribution networks;\n\u25cf\ngreater ability to cross-sell products or provide incentives to healthcare providers to use their products; and\n\u25cf\nmore experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approval or clearance.\nIn some instances, our competitors offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For instance, Medtronic currently offers a traditional insulin pump that is integrated with a CGM system with a threshold suspend feature. In addition, Medtronic recently announced that it received FDA approval of a new insulin pump product with additional functionality and a new CGM system that it intends to launch during 2017. Furthermore, Insulet offers an insulin pump with a tubeless delivery system that does not utilize an infusion set. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or potential future competitors. As a result, we may fail to meet our forecasted budget, and our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe administration of the Technology Upgrade Program may result in unanticipated difficulties or costs, which may harm our financial condition or operating results.\nIn July 2016, we announced the implementation of the Technology Upgrade Program that allows eligible t:slim and t:slim G4 customers the ability to trade in their existing pump for t:slim X2, subject to the conditions specified in the program. The Technology Upgrade Program is being offered to provide our existing customers the ability to upgrade to the features and capabilities of t:slim X2. However, we do not have experience implementing and administering trade-in programs of this type and we may encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or uncertainties in administering or fulfilling our obligations under the Technology Upgrade Program. For example, it is difficult to predict the impact of the adoption of the Technology Upgrade Program on the willingness of consumers to purchase our products compared to competitive products, or the timing of any purchase decisions. If we incur unexpected difficulties, costs or uncertainties in administering the Technology Upgrade Program, or if we do not derive the anticipated benefits to our business from offering the program to our customers, the program could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Technology Upgrade Program has resulted in accounting complexities that may be difficult for investors to understand and may lead to confusion when comparing our historical and future financial results.\nThe Technology Upgrade Program has resulted in a number of accounting complexities that will make comparisons of our historical and future financial results more difficult. In particular, United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, prevent us from recognizing, at the time of sale, up to 100% of the sales and cost of sales associated with the sale of t:slim and t:slim G4 made to eligible customers during the term of the Technology Upgrade Program. Instead, depending on the type of pump sold, we are required to defer some or all of the sales and cost of sales until a later date, which will generally be the earlier of when our obligations under the Technology Upgrade Program are satisfied or when the program expires. The amount and timing of the deferred sales and cost of sales will depend on multiple factors that are based on future events that are difficult to estimate or predict, especially because we have not offered a similar trade-in program in the past. For example, we do not currently have sufficient history to reasonably estimate the likelihood that the trade-in rights will be exercised, or the timing of any trade-in decisions. Accordingly, it is very difficult for us to estimate the amount of the deferrals with any level of certainty, which makes it very difficult for us to predict our GAAP results, including revenues and operating margins.\nDespite our efforts to explain the required accounting treatment for the Technology Upgrade Program, it is possible that investors or analysts will view the accounting treatment or the resulting impact on our GAAP financial results negatively, and there may be confusion when comparing our historical and future financial results, which may cause our stock price to decline. In addition, the complexities associated with the accounting treatment, or with the Technology Upgrade Program generally, may cause investors to avoid purchasing our common stock until the impact of the program is better understood or our financial results and trends are more predictable, which also may adversely impact our stock price.\nOur ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit cost of our products by increasing production volume and manufacturing efficiency, including by reducing raw material, labor, product-training, expected warranty and manufacturing overhead costs per unit.\nWe believe that our ability to reduce the per-unit cost of our insulin pump products and related cartridges will have a significant impact on our ability to achieve profitability. Our cost of sales includes raw material procurement costs, labor costs, product-training expenses and expected warranty expenses. It also includes manufacturing overhead costs, including expenses relating to quality assurance, inventory control, facilities, equipment, information technology, and operations management. If we are unable to sustain or reduce our overall cost of sales, including through arrangements such as volume purchase discounts, negotiation of improved pricing, more efficient training programs for customers, and improved warranty performance, it will be difficult to reduce our per unit costs and our ability to achieve profitability will be constrained. The per unit cost of our products is significantly impacted by our overall production volumes, and any factors that cause our production volumes to decline, or to grow at a slower rate than we expect, would significantly impact our expected per unit costs. In addition, we may experience disruption in our manufacturing productivity or incur duplicative or incremental costs as we manage the planned relocation of our manufacturing facility over the next 12 months. Furthermore, while we currently believe our proprietary technology platform will allow us to gain efficiencies in the design and development of new products, changes in the market that require us to modify or replace our existing platform will reduce the amount of efficiency gained through our platform and increase our per unit costs. If we are unable to effectively manage our overall costs, while increasing our production volumes, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe failure of our products to achieve and maintain market acceptance could result in us achieving sales below our expectations, which would cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current business strategy is highly dependent on our insulin pump products, which currently include t:slim X2, t:flex and t:slim G4, achieving and maintaining market acceptance. In order for us to sell our products to people with insulin-dependent diabetes, we must convince them, their caregivers and healthcare providers that it is an attractive alternative to competitive products for the treatment of diabetes, including traditional insulin pump products and MDI therapies, as well as alternative insulin treatment methodologies. Market acceptance and adoption of our products depends on educating people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, about the distinct features, ease-of-use, positive lifestyle impact, and other perceived benefits of our products as compared to competitive products. If we are not successful in convincing existing and potential customers of the benefits of our products, or if we are not able to achieve the support of caregivers and healthcare providers for our insulin pump products, our sales may decline or we may fail to increase our sales in line with our forecasts.\nAchieving and maintaining market acceptance of our products could be negatively impacted by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe failure of our products to achieve wide acceptance among people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers, third-party payors and key opinion leaders in the diabetes treatment community;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of our products to provide the features and functionality that people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking in an insulin pump, and to incorporate those features into our products in a timely, cost-effective and user-friendly manner;\n\u25cf\nlack of evidence supporting the safety, ease-of-use or other perceived benefits of our products over competitive products or other currently-available insulin treatment methodologies;\n\u25cf\nperceived risks or uncertainties associated with the use of our insulin pump products or similar products or technologies generally;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of competitive products, technologies or treatment techniques and the rate of their acceptance as compared to our insulin pump products;\n\u25cf\ndiscounts, rebates and other financial incentives that our competitors may offer for competitive products that make them more attractive than our products; and\n\u25cf\nresults of clinical studies relating to our existing products or products under development or similar competitive products.\nIn addition, even if we are able to convince people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers or healthcare providers that our products compare favorably to the products and treatment alternatives offered by our competitors, negative perceptions regarding our financial stability relative to that of our competitors, and our ability to sustain our business operations on a long-term basis, especially in light of our recent financial results and the recent decline in the market price of our common stock, could cause consumers to delay the purchase of our products or to purchase competitive products.\nFurthermore, the rapid evolution of technology and treatment options within our industry may cause consumers to delay the purchase of our products in anticipation of advancements, or the perception that advancements could occur, in our products or the products offered by our competitors. For example, we believe that during the second half of 2016, consumers interested in purchasing our insulin pump products may have delayed or changed their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the release of a new product by one of our competitors. It is also possible that consumers interested in purchasing any of our future products currently under development may delay the purchase of one of our current products.\nIf our insulin pump products do not achieve and maintain widespread market acceptance, we may fail to achieve sales at or above our projected amounts. If our sales do not meet our sales projections, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and we may fail to meet our strategic objectives.\nFailure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our current products and our potential future products by third-party payors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have derived nearly all of our revenue from sales of insulin pumps and associated supplies and expect to continue to do so. A substantial portion of the purchase price of an insulin pump is typically paid for by third-party payors, including private insurance companies, preferred provider organizations and other managed care providers. Future sales of our current and future products will be limited unless our customers can rely on third-party payors to pay for all or part of the associated purchase cost. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors is essential to the acceptance of our products by customers.\nAs guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies, many third-party payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the U.S. Medicare program. Medicare periodically reviews its reimbursement practices for diabetes-related products. Medicare previously implemented a competitive bidding process for blood glucose strip reimbursement, which resulted in a significant reduction in the reimbursement rate for those products. More recently, in 2017, Medicare announced, and then shortly thereafter suspended, a competitive bidding process for insulin pumps. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the future Medicare reimbursement rate for our products. In addition, those third-party payors that do not follow the CMS guidelines may adopt different coverage and reimbursement policies for our current and future products. It is possible that some third-party payors will not offer any coverage for our current or future products. For instance, effective July 1, 2016, UnitedHealthcare designated one of our competitors as their preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers over the age of 18. We expect this decision will prevent a majority of UnitedHealthcare members from purchasing an insulin pump from us for the foreseeable future. It is possible that other third-party payors may adopt similar policies in the future, which would adversely impact our ability to sell our products.\nWe currently have contracts establishing reimbursement for our insulin pump products with approximately 150 national and regional third-party payors in the United States. While we anticipate entering into additional contracts with third-party payors and adding coverage for future products under our current agreements, we cannot guarantee that we will\nsucceed in doing so or that the reimbursement contracts that we are able to negotiate will enable us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In particular, any negative perceptions among third-party payors regarding our financial stability and our ability to continue to sell and service our products, may make it more difficult to enter into contracts for reimbursement with additional third-party payors. This may be especially true in light of our conclusion that, if we do not successfully raise additional capital, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern included in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, existing contracts with third-party payors generally can be modified or terminated by the third-party payor without cause and with little or no notice to us. Moreover, compliance with the administrative procedures or requirements of third-party payors may result in delays in processing approvals by those third-party payors for customers to obtain coverage for our products. Failure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our current and future products by third-party payors, or delays in processing approvals by those payors, could result in the loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, the healthcare industry in the United States is increasingly focused on cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with third-party payors. If third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our production costs increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nCompetitive products or other technological developments and breakthroughs for the monitoring, treatment or prevention of diabetes may render our products obsolete or less desirable.\nOur ability to achieve our strategic objectives will depend, among other things, on our ability to develop and commercialize products for the treatment of diabetes that offer distinct features and functionality, are easy-to-use, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, and are more appealing than available alternatives. Our primary competitors, as well as a number of other companies, medical researchers and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing new delivery devices, delivery technologies, sensing technologies, procedures, drugs and other therapies for the monitoring, treatment and prevention of diabetes. Any technological breakthroughs in diabetes monitoring, treatment or prevention could reduce the potential market for our products or render our products obsolete altogether, which would significantly reduce our sales or cause our sales to grow at a slower rate than we currently expect. In addition, even the perception that new products may be introduced, or that technological or treatment advancements could occur, could cause consumers to delay the purchase of our products.\nBecause the insulin-dependent diabetes market is large and growing, we anticipate that companies will continue to dedicate significant resources to developing competitive products. The frequent introduction by competitors of products that are or claim to be superior to our products may create market confusion that may make it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our products over competitive products. In addition, some of our competitors employ aggressive pricing strategies, including the use of discounts, rebates, low cost product upgrades or other financial incentives that could adversely affect sales of our products. If a competitor develops a product that competes with or is perceived to be superior to our products, or if competitors continue to utilize strategies that place downward pressure on pricing within our industry, our sales may decline, our operating margins could be reduced and we may fail to meet our projections, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, we have designed our products to resemble modern consumer electronic devices to address certain embarrassment and functionality concerns consumers have raised with respect to traditional pumps. The consumer electronics industry is itself highly competitive, and characterized by continuous new product introductions, rapid developments in technology, and subjective and changing consumer preferences. If, in the future, consumers cease to view our products as contemporary or convenient as compared to then-existing consumer electronics technology, our products may become less desirable.\nWe may face unexpected challenges in marketing, selling and training new customers on the use of our products, which could harm our ability to achieve our sales and service objectives.\nWe have only limited experience marketing and selling our products as well as training new customers on their use. In addition, the vast majority of our existing customers are individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we have only limited experience marketing and selling our products to customers with type 2 diabetes. As a result, we may face unexpected challenges marketing and selling t:flex, which is designed to meet the needs of customers with type 2 diabetes and/or higher insulin requirements.\nWe expect to derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of t:slim X2, t:flex, and t:slim G4 Pumps and pump-related supplies unless and until we receive regulatory clearance or approval for other products currently under development. As a result, our financial condition and operating results are and will continue to be highly dependent on the ability of our sales and marketing organization to adequately promote, market and sell our insulin pumps and related products, and the ability of our diabetes educators to train new customers on the use of our products. If our sales and marketing representatives or diabetes educators fail to achieve their objectives, our sales could decrease or may not increase at levels that are in line with our forecasts.\nIf we are unable to maintain our existing sales, marketing, clinical and customer service infrastructure, we may fail to increase our sales to meet our forecasts.\nA key element of our business strategy is the ability of our sales, clinical, marketing and customer service infrastructure to drive adoption of our products, which includes independent diabetes educators that train new customers on the use of our products. We have rapidly increased the number of sales, marketing, clinical and customer service personnel employed by us since the initial commercial launch of t:slim in 2012. However, we have faced considerable challenges in growing and managing these resources, including with respect to recruiting, training and assimilation of new territories and accounts. We expect to continue to face significant challenges as we manage and grow our infrastructure in the future and work to motivate and retain the individuals who make up our existing infrastructure. These challenges may be even greater in light of negative perceptions regarding our financial stability, and the recent decline in our stock price, which may make it more difficult to motivate and retain key personnel. Unexpected turnover among our sales, marketing, clinical and customer service personnel would have a negative impact on our ability to achieve our sales projections. Further, if a sales, marketing or clinical representative was to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may fail to prevent him or her from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could adversely affect our sales. Similarly, if we are not able to recruit and retain a network of diabetes educators and customer service personnel, we may not be able to successfully train and service new customers, which could delay new sales and harm our reputation.\nWe expect that the management of our sales, marketing, clinical and customer service personnel will continue to place significant burdens on our management team. If we are unable to retain our personnel in line with our strategic plans, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our existing products or products under development, or enhance the strength of our brand, either of which could result in the failure of our sales to increase in line with our projections or could even cause sales to decline.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are dependent on independent distributors who are free to market products that compete with our products. If we are unable to maintain or expand our network of independent distributors, our sales may be negatively affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to approximately 40 independent distributors represented approximately 74% of our sales. While our goal is to ultimately reduce the percentage of our sales to independent distributors over time as we enter into contracts with additional third-party payors, we believe that a meaningful percentage of our sales will continue to be to independent distributors for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that the percentage of our sales to independent distributors could even increase in the near term. For example, our dependence upon independent distributors could increase if third-party payors decide to contract with independent distributors directly in lieu of contracting with us to supply our products to their members directly. Our dependence upon independent distributors is also expected to increase following our launch of the t:lock Connector for our insulin cartridge, which we expect will result in greater sales of our infusion sets to distributors. Our dependence upon independent distributors could also increase if customers prefer to purchase all of their diabetes supplies through a single source, instead of purchasing pump-related products through us and other diabetes supplies through other suppliers. However, our conclusion that, unless we successfully raise additional capital, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, together with the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, may negatively impact one or more of our distributors\u2019 interest in continuing to do business with us. None of our independent distributors has been required to sell our products exclusively and each of them may freely sell the products of our competitors. Our distributor agreements generally have one-year initial terms with automatic one-year renewal terms, and are terminable in connection with a party\u2019s material breach. If we are unable to maintain or expand our network of independent distributors, our sales may be negatively affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our two largest independent distributors collectively comprised approximately 33% of our sales. If any of our key independent distributors were to cease to distribute our products or reduce their promotion of our products as compared to the products of our competitors, our sales could be adversely affected. In such a situation, we may need to seek alternative independent distributors or increase our reliance on our other independent distributors or our direct sales representatives, which may not prevent our sales from being adversely affected. Additionally, to the extent that we enter into additional arrangements with independent distributors to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, or other arrangements pursuant to which independent distributors may purchase product from us, the terms of the arrangements could cause our product margins to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products.\nIf the third parties on which we increasingly rely to assist us with our current and anticipated pre-clinical development or clinical trials do not perform as expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval or commercialize our products.\nAs our clinical infrastructure expands, we expect to increasingly rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct some of our current and anticipated pre-clinical investigations and clinical trials. If we are not able to contract with or reach other mutually acceptable agreements with these third parties on a timely basis or on mutually acceptable terms, or these third parties do not successfully carry out their commitments or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to agreed upon clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. In particular, we currently expect to rely on data from the IDCL Trial to support our development of t:slim X2 with TypeZero inControl AID algorithms. The IDCL Trial is being conducted entirely by third parties over which we have little or no control or influence. In the event that the IDCL Trial is not performed on a timely basis, or if the quality or accuracy of the data obtained from the IDCL Trial is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our development activities for t:slim X2 with TypeZero may be negatively impacted.\nWe are increasingly dependent on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our current and anticipated clinical trials, and the failure to successfully complete the clinical trials could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for or commercializing our products.\nAs part of our product development efforts, we expect to increasingly rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage such trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our clinical trials, especially with respect to the IDCL Trial that we intend to rely upon for the development of t:slim X2 with TypeZero. If these clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients, fail to ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may be unable to successfully complete our clinical trials, which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and commercializing our products, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our revenue depends in part on retaining a high percentage of our customer base.\nA key to maintaining and growing our revenue is the retention of a high percentage of our customers due to the potentially significant revenue generated from ongoing purchases of disposable insulin cartridges and other supplies. In addition, our pumps are designed and tested to remain effective for at least four years and a satisfied customer may consider purchasing another product from us when the time comes to replace the pump. We have developed retention programs aimed at customers, their caregivers and healthcare providers, which include training specific to our products, ongoing support by sales and clinical employees, and 24/7 technical support and customer service. If demand for our products fluctuates, including as a result of the introduction of competitive products, changes in reimbursement policies, manufacturing problems, perceived safety or reliability issues with our or our competitors\u2019 products, the failure to secure regulatory clearance or approvals, or for other reasons, our ability to attract and retain customers could be harmed. In addition, the retention of current customers may be impacted by negative perceptions regarding our financial stability relative to that of our competitors, and our ability to sustain our business operations on a long-term basis. The failure to retain a high percentage of our customers would negatively impact our revenue growth and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf important assumptions about the potential market for our products are inaccurate, or if we have failed to understand what people with insulin-dependent diabetes are seeking in an insulin pump, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about the diabetes industry in general, and the insulin-dependent diabetes market in particular, any one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or may change over time. For example, we believe that the benefits of insulin pump therapy as compared to other common insulin treatment alternatives will continue to drive growth in the market for insulin pump therapy. In addition, we believe the incidence of diabetes in the United States and worldwide is increasing. However, each of these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate and limited sources exist to compare treatment alternatives and obtain reliable market data. The actual incidence of diabetes, and the actual demand for our products or competitive products, could differ materially from our projections if our assumptions are incorrect. In addition, our strategy of focusing exclusively on the insulin-dependent diabetes market may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability.\nAnother key element of our business strategy is utilizing market research to understand what people with diabetes are seeking to improve their diabetes therapy management. This strategy underlies our entire product design, marketing and customer support approach and is the basis on which we developed our current products and are pursuing the development of new products. However, our market research is based on interviews, focus groups and online surveys involving people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers that represent only a small percentage of the overall insulin-dependent diabetes market. As a result, the responses we received may not be reflective of the broader market and may not provide us accurate insight into the desires of people with insulin-dependent diabetes. In addition, understanding the meaning and significance of the responses received during our market research necessarily requires that analysis be conducted and conclusions be drawn. We may not be able perform an analysis that yields meaningful results, or the conclusions we draw from the analysis could be misleading or incorrect. Moreover, even if our market research has allowed us to better understand the features and functionality consumers are seeking in an insulin pump to improve management of their diabetes therapy, there can be no assurance that consumers will actually purchase our products or that our competitors will not develop products with similar features.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and forecast our future sales and operating results and may face difficulties frequently encountered by companies early in their commercialization in competitive and rapidly-evolving markets.\nWe commenced operations in 2006, and began commercial sales of t:slim in the third quarter of 2012, of t:flex in the second quarter of 2015 and of t:slim G4 in the third quarter of 2015. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and forecast our future sales and operating results. More recently, our launch of t:slim X2, our adoption of the Technology Upgrade Program, the FDA approval and launch of new products by one of our competitors, and the use of aggressive pricing strategies by our competitors combine to make forecasting our future sales and operating results even more challenging. In assessing our business prospects, you should consider the various risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies early in their commercialization history in competitive and rapidly evolving markets, particularly companies that develop and sell medical devices. These risks include our ability to:\n\u25cf\nimplement and execute our business strategy;\n\u25cf\nmanage and improve the productivity of our sales, clinical and marketing infrastructure to grow sales of our existing and proposed products;\n\u25cf\nincrease awareness of our brand and build loyalty among people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers;\n\u25cf\nexpand our commercial operations, including complying with a broad range of legal requirements within a highly regulated industry;\n\u25cf\nexpand our manufacturing capabilities, including increasing production of current products efficiently while maintaining quality standards and adapting our manufacturing facilities to the production of new products;\n\u25cf\nrespond effectively to competitive pressures and developments;\n\u25cf\nenhance our existing products and develop proposed products;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain regulatory clearance or approval to enhance our existing products and commercialize proposed products;\n\u25cf\nperform clinical trials with respect to our existing products and proposed products; and\n\u25cf\nattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in various areas of our business.\nDue to our limited operating history, we may not have the institutional knowledge or experience to be able to effectively address these and other risks that may face our business. In addition, we may not be able to develop insights into trends that could emerge and negatively affect our business and may fail to respond effectively to those trends. As a result of these or other risks, we may not be able to execute key components of our business strategy, and our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\nManufacturing risks may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products, which could negatively impact our sales and operating margins.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to manufacture our current and proposed products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis so as to meet consumer demand, while adhering to product quality standards, complying with regulatory requirements and managing manufacturing costs. We are subject to numerous risks relating to our manufacturing capabilities, including:\n\u25cf\nquality or reliability defects in product components that we source from third-party suppliers;\n\u25cf\nour inability to secure product components in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities and on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nthe challenge of implementing and maintaining acceptable quality systems while experiencing rapid growth;\n\u25cf\nour failure to increase production of products to meet demand;\n\u25cf\nour inability to modify production lines to enable us to efficiently produce future products or implement changes in current products in response to consumer demand or regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nour inability to manufacture multiple products simultaneously while utilizing common manufacturing equipment; and\n\u25cf\npotential damage to or destruction of our manufacturing equipment or manufacturing facility.\nThese risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with our current products and manufacturing processes.\nAs demand for our products increases, and as the number of our commercial products expands, we will have to invest additional resources to purchase components, hire and train employees, and enhance our manufacturing processes and quality systems. Over the past year we have implemented several new pieces of equipment that are intended to improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency and we expect to implement additional equipment and procedures over the next 12-18 months. However, it is possible that we may not achieve the anticipated improvements from these investments. In addition, we recently entered into a new lease agreement for an additional facility to consolidate substantially all of our manufacturing, warehousing and other operational needs, and any transition of our current manufacturing, warehousing and other operations to a new facility is subject to additional risk and uncertainty, and may expose us to duplicative or incremental costs. Furthermore, although we expect some of our products under development to share product features and components with our current products, manufacturing of these products may require the modification of our production lines, the hiring of specialized employees, the identification of new suppliers for specific components, the implementation of additional equipment and procedures, or the development of new manufacturing technologies. Ultimately, it may not be possible for us to manufacture these products at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make these products commercially viable.\nIf we fail to increase our production capacity to meet consumer demand, while also maintaining product quality standards, complying with regulatory requirements and efficiently managing costs, our sales and operating margins could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain product components, and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of components, could harm our business.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers to supply components of our current products and of our potential future products, including our disposable cartridges. For example, we rely on plastic injection molding companies to provide plastic molded components, electronic manufacturing suppliers to provide electronic assemblies, and machining companies to provide machined mechanical components. We also purchase all of our infusion sets and pump accessories from third-party suppliers. For our business strategy to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with components in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed-upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Recently, we have implemented several business strategies intended to increase our future sales of infusion sets. Increases in any of our product sales, whether forecasted or unanticipated, could strain the ability of our suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of components in a manner that meets these various requirements.\nWe do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our suppliers and, in many cases, we make our purchases on a purchase order basis. Under most of our supply agreements, we have no obligation to buy any given quantity of components or products until we place written orders, and our suppliers have no obligation to manufacture for us or sell to us any given quantity of components or products until they accept an order. As a result, our ability to purchase adequate quantities of our components or products may be limited. Additionally, our suppliers may encounter problems that limit their ability to manufacture components or products for us, including financial difficulties or damage to their manufacturing equipment or facilities. If we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet demand on a timely basis, we could lose customer orders, our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer. Our conclusion that, unless we successfully raise additional capital, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, together with the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, may cause one or more of our suppliers to terminate their relationship with us, or claim that our financial condition causes them to demand different payment terms.\nWe generally use a small number of suppliers for our components or products. Depending on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. Moreover, in some cases, we do not have long-standing relationships with our manufacturers and may not be able to convince suppliers to continue to make components available to us unless there is demand for such components from their other customers. As a result, there is a risk that certain components could be discontinued and no longer available to us. We have in the past been, and we may in the future be, required to make significant \u201clast time\u201d purchases of component inventory that is being discontinued by the manufacturer to ensure supply continuity. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our quality control standards and applicable regulatory requirements, we cannot quickly engage additional or replacement suppliers for some of our critical components. Failure of any of our suppliers to deliver products at the level our business requires would limit our ability to meet our sales commitments, which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may also have difficulty obtaining similar components from other suppliers that are acceptable to the FDA, or other regulatory agencies, and the failure of our suppliers to comply with strictly-enforced regulatory requirements could expose us to regulatory action including warning letters, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. Such a failure by our suppliers could also require us to cease using the components, seek alternative components or technologies, and modify our products to incorporate alternative components or technologies, which could necessitate additional regulatory approvals. Any disruption of this nature, or any increased expenses associated with any such disruptions, could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or at all, which could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we cannot manufacture and sell our new infusion set connector when anticipated, or if it does not achieve market acceptance, we may not achieve our financial projections.\nWe intend to transition from the use of a standard Luer-lok connector on our proprietary disposable insulin cartridges to our new t:lock Connector. Concurrently, we intend to begin selling infusion sets that will be compatible with our t:lock Connector. We have filed for but not yet received regulatory approval to manufacture our insulin cartridges with the necessary modifications to change our infusion set connector from a standard Luer-lok to our t:lock Connector. In addition, our infusion set supplier intends to seek 510(k) clearance for its infusion sets with the companion to our t:lock Connector.\nOur anticipated 2017 sales assume that our current and future customers will begin using our new cartridges and infusion sets with our t:lock Connector in significant quantities by the end of 2017. Any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals for our new insulin cartridge with the t:lock Connector or the compatible infusion sets would negatively impact our operating results and may harm our ability to meet our financial projections or those of our financial analysts. In order to manufacture our cartridges with the t:lock Connector, we must order and validate new molding equipment. Furthermore, our supplier of infusion sets must begin manufacturing a variety of lengths and styles of infusion sets with the t:lock Connector that matches our cartridges. Failure to do so, or to do so at the necessary production volumes, may result in our inability to launch our t:lock Connector or convert customers to our t:lock Connector when anticipated.\nIn addition, our independent distributors will need to agree to purchase the compatible infusion sets from us to provide to their customers. We anticipate the transition period for our direct customers and distributors to utilize their inventory on hand before transitioning to the t:lock Connector will be 90 to 120 days following its initial launch. During this period we anticipate offering both styles of cartridges and infusion sets to facilitate the transition of customer supplies. However, due to the variability in purchasing patterns, standard Luer-lok inventory may not be consumed at the predicted rates and we may be\nrequired to offer both styles of insulin cartridges and infusion sets for a longer period than anticipated or we may be left with excess quantities of Luer-lok style insulin cartridges that we cannot sell at standard prices or at all.\nWhile the t:lock Connector was designed based on customer feedback, and while all standard Luer-lok infusion sets that we currently offer will initially be made available with the t:lock Connector, it is possible the t:lock Connector may not gain market acceptance by current or potential customers, their caregivers, or healthcare providers. Any negative market response to the t:lock Connector may impact a current customer\u2019s decision to purchase a new pump from us at the time of renewal. In addition, new potential customers may decide not to purchase our insulin pumps if they do not prefer our t:lock Connector, which may impede our ability to achieve our financial projections.\nWe currently operate primarily at a single location comprised of five buildings, and any disruption at this location could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur principal offices are presently located in five buildings in San Diego, California. Substantially all of our operations are presently conducted at this location, including our manufacturing processes, research and development activities, customer and technical support, and management and administrative functions. In addition, substantially all of our inventory of component supplies and finished goods is held at this location. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including acquiring insurance, employing back-up generators, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. However, vandalism, terrorism or a natural or other disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or our inventory of component supplies and finished goods, cause substantial delays in our operations, result in the loss of key information, and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. Regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe transition of our manufacturing operations to a new facility may result in unanticipated expenses or inefficiencies, which may increase our manufacturing and operating costs, and will require us to spend additional capital.\nWe manufacture our products at our headquarters in San Diego, California, but will be transitioning our manufacturing operations to a nearby facility that will allow for future capacity expansion. The transition to the new manufacturing facility is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2017 and be completed by the end of 2017. During the transition period we expect to experience some temporary duplication of operations to support ongoing product manufacturing, which will result in incremental costs. The transition remains subject to completion of ongoing construction, validation of newly installed equipment and our ability to receive numerous governmental approvals associated with the new facility. We may face significant challenges as we manage our proposed facility transition, such as unanticipated delays or expenses, and we will be required to make capital expenditures relating to the new facility. We also may experience unanticipated inefficiencies as we commence manufacturing operations at the new facility, particularly during the transition period. If we fail to achieve the operating efficiencies that we anticipate from the new facility, or if we incur substantial incremental costs during the transition, our manufacturing and operating costs may be greater than we anticipate.\nWe expect that the management and support of our transition to the new facility will place significant burdens on our management team, particularly in areas relating to operations, facilities and information technology. If we experience unanticipated employee turnover in any of these areas, we may not be able to effectively manage the completion of construction of the new facility or our transition and commencement of manufacturing operations when planned and we may not achieve the operating efficiencies that we anticipate from the new facility.\nIf we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may fail to effectively compete or become profitable.\nIn order to increase our sales and market share in the insulin-dependent diabetes market, we must enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to the evolving demands of people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers, as well as competitive pressures and technologies. We may not be successful in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, or marketing our proposed products when anticipated, or at all. In addition, notwithstanding our market research efforts, our future products may not be accepted by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers or third-party payors. The success of any proposed product offerings will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf\nidentify the product features and functionality that people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking in an insulin pump, and successfully incorporate those features into our products;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and introduce products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\noffer products at a price that is competitive with other products then available;\n\u25cf\nwork with third-party payors to obtain reimbursement for our products;\n\u25cf\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u25cf\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of proposed products; and\n\u25cf\nobtain the necessary regulatory approvals for proposed products.\nIf we fail to generate demand by continuing to develop products that incorporate features and functionality requested by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers or healthcare providers, or if we do not obtain regulatory clearance or approval for proposed products in time to meet market demand, we may be unable to compete and may fail to generate sales sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability. We have in the past experienced, and we may in the future experience, delays in various phases of product development and commercialization, including during research and development, manufacturing, limited release testing, marketing and customer education efforts. Any delays in our anticipated regulatory submissions or approvals, or subsequent product launches, may significantly impede our ability to successfully compete in our markets. In particular, such delays could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products, or to purchase our competitors\u2019 products. Even if we are able to successfully develop proposed products when anticipated, these products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing consumer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features, or alternative methods for the treatment of diabetes.\nThe safety and efficacy of our products is not supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our products could cause unforeseen negative effects.\nt:slim X2 and t:flex received pre-market clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. The 510(k) clearance process is shorter and typically requires the submission of less supporting documentation than other FDA approval processes and does not always require long-term clinical studies. t:slim G4 received FDA approval under a PMA. However, there are no published studies to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of t:slim G4 in a controlled setting.\nAs a result, we currently lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of our products and the benefits they offer, that might have been generated in connection with other approval processes. For these reasons, people with insulin-dependent diabetes and healthcare providers may be slower to adopt or recommend our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, third-party payors may not be willing to provide coverage or reimbursement for our products and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. These and other factors could slow the adoption of our products and result in our sales being lower than anticipated. In addition, future studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products is not superior to treatment with competitive products. Such results could slow the adoption of our products and significantly reduce our sales, which could prevent us from achieving our forecasted sales targets or achieving or sustaining profitability.\nIf the results of clinical studies or other experience, such as our monitoring or investigation of customer complaints, indicate that our products may cause or create an unacceptable risk of unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to mandatory product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval, significant legal liability, and harm to our business reputation.\nAny alleged illness or injury associated with any of our products or product recall may negatively impact our financial results and business prospects depending on the scope, degree of publicity, reaction of our customers, healthcare professionals, and collaborators, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes overall. Even if such an allegation or product liability claim lacks merit, cannot be substantiated, is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness, injury or death could adversely affect our reputation with customers, healthcare professionals, third-party payors, and existing and potential collaborators, and could adversely affect our operating results and cause a decline in our stock price.\nWe may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships to develop proposed products and to pursue new markets, or we may amend or modify similar agreements that we already have in place. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited institutional knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success or result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products.\nAdditionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations, termination rights or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with our current or future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our current collaborators, such as DexCom and TypeZero, or any future collaborators devote to our arrangement with them or our future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and arrangements are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to have rights to the products relating to such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.\nFor example, we entered into three separate development agreements with DexCom which provide us non-exclusive licenses to integrate various generations of DexCom CGM technology with our insulin pump products. We currently offer t:slim G4 under an agreement that runs until January 4, 2018, with automatic one-year renewals. Under certain circumstances, our agreements with DexCom may be terminated by either party without cause or on short notice. Termination of any of our agreements with DexCom could require us to redesign certain current products and products under development, and attempt to integrate an alternative CGM system into our insulin pump systems, which would require significant development and regulatory activities that could result in an interruption or substantial delay in the availability of the product to our customers.\nAny significant disruptions to our information technology systems, or failures of our pumps\u2019 software to perform as we anticipate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, manufacturing and quality records, inventory management, product development tasks, research and development data, customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems, including those that support t:connect, as well as those involved in the operation of our Tandem Device Updater, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power losses, and computer system or data network failures. In addition, our currently-marketed insulin pumps, and our products currently under development contain software which could be subject to computer virus, hacker attacks or other failures. As a result of the recent FDA clearance of our Tandem Device Updater, which enables customers to remotely update software on their insulin pumps, these risks are significantly increased.\nThe failure of our or our service providers\u2019 information technology systems or our pumps\u2019 software to perform as we anticipate or our failure to effectively implement new information technology systems could disrupt our entire operation or adversely affect our software products. For example, we market our Tandem Device Updater as having the unique capability to deploy software updates to our pumps, which we anticipate may allow customers remote access to new and enhanced features. The failure of our Tandem Device Updater to provide software updates as we anticipate, including as a result of our inability to secure and maintain necessary regulatory approvals, the inability of our pumps to properly receive software updates, errors or viruses embedded within the software being transmitted, or the failure of our customers to properly utilize the system to complete the update, could result in decreased sales, increased warranty costs, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nOur rapid growth has placed, and we expect that it will continue to place, a significant strain on our management team and financial resources. For example, between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 our employee base increased by approximately 23%. In addition, during 2015 and 2016 we experienced turnover among key employees in our sales, marketing, clinical, and research and development functions, including the hiring of a new Chief Commercial Officer and a new Vice President of Engineering. Our failure to manage growth effectively could cause us to misallocate management or financial resources, negatively impact our ability to attract and retain key employees, and result in losses or weaknesses in our infrastructure, which could materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, our anticipated growth and the projected evolution of our product portfolio will increase the demands placed on our suppliers, resulting in an increased need for us to manage our suppliers and monitor for quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe depend on the knowledge and skills of our senior management and other key employees, and if we are unable to retain and motivate them or recruit additional qualified personnel, our business may suffer.\nWe have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management, as well as certain key employees. For example, our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other key members of management, have experience successfully scaling an early stage medical device company to achieve profitability. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management and key employees, and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management and key employees in our industry is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our personnel or attract new, qualified personnel. This may be especially true during periods in which we face challenges such as financial difficulty or a reduced stock price. The loss of the services of certain members of our senior management or key employees could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic objectives, or divert management\u2019s attention to seeking qualified replacements. Each member of senior management as well as our key employees may terminate employment without notice and without cause or good reason. The members of our senior management are not subject to non-competition agreements. Accordingly, the adverse effect resulting from the loss of certain members of senior management could be compounded by our inability to prevent them from competing with us.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, promulgated patient privacy rules under HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we, or any of our service providers, are found to be in violation of the promulgated patient privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of complementary products or technologies, and the failure to successfully manage acquisitions, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Potential acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nproblems assimilating the acquired products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; and\n\u25cf\nincreased legal and accounting costs relating to the acquisitions or to compliance with regulatory matters.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired products or technologies into our business. Our potential inability to integrate any acquired products or technologies effectively may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future. If these funds are not available to us, we will not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $55.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which included $2.0 million of restricted cash. At the date our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 were issued, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through December 31, 2017 without additional financing and therefore, we concluded there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements were issued. As a result, the audit report and opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, the continued growth of our business, including the expansion of our customer care infrastructure to support our growing base of customers, additional research and development activities, and the transition to our new manufacturing facility, will continue to increase our expenses and capital needs. In addition, the amount of our future product sales is difficult to predict and actual sales may not be in line with our forecasts. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe revenue generated by sales of our insulin pump products and pump-related supplies, and any other future products that we may develop and commercialize;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with maintaining an appropriate sales, clinical and marketing infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nthe gross profits we realize from the sales we generate and the expenses we incur in maintaining and expanding our manufacturing infrastructure, including opening our new manufacturing location and adding additional manufacturing equipment and capacity;\n\u25cf\nthe cost associated with developing and commercializing our proposed products or technologies, including any costs to administer the Technology Upgrade Program;\n\u25cf\nthe costs associated with maintaining and expanding our customer care infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearance or approval for our current or future products;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of ongoing compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nexpenses we incur in connection with potential litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u25cf\nour compliance with the covenants in our Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement with Capital Royalty Partners II, L.P. and its affiliate funds, or Capital Royalty Partners, as amended, which we refer to as the Term Loan Agreement;\n\u25cf\nanticipated or unanticipated capital expenditures; and\n\u25cf\nunanticipated general and administrative expenses.\nAs a result of these and other factors, management currently believes that it will be necessary for us to raise additional funding in the form of an equity financing from the sale of common stock. We may in the future seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock or we may elect to borrow additional amounts under new credit lines or from other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, we may incur significant financing costs, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnership arrangements or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential future products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital, we may not be able to maintain our existing sales, marketing, clinical and customer care infrastructure, enhance our current products or develop new products, take advantage of future opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, changes in supplier relationships, or unanticipated changes in customer demand, or satisfy covenants in our existing indebtedness. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThere has been and may continue to be meaningful variability in our operating results from quarter to quarter, as well as within each quarter, especially around the time of anticipated new product introductions. Our operating results, and the variability of these operating results, will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to increase sales and gross profit of our insulin pump products and pump-related supplies, and to commercialize and sell our future products, and the number of our products sold in each quarter;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our products by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers and third-party payors;\n\u25cf\nthe financial and accounting impacts of the Technology Upgrade Program;\n\u25cf\nthe pricing of our products and competitive products, including the use of discounts, rebates or other financial incentives by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of third-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to maintain our existing infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of, and the timing of the payment for, insurance deductibles required to be paid by our customers and potential customers under their existing insurance plans;\n\u25cf\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u25cf\nour ability to simultaneously manufacture multiple products that meet quality and reliability requirements;\n\u25cf\nseasonality and other factors affecting the timing of purchases of our products;\n\u25cf\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing and future products;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of components that meet our requirements;\n\u25cf\nregulatory clearance or approvals affecting our products or those of our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing of revenue and expense recognition associated with our product sales pursuant to applicable accounting standards.\nAs a result of our recent product launches, and due to the complexities of the industry in which we operate, it will continue to be difficult for us to forecast demand for our products with any degree of certainty, which means it will be difficult for us to forecast our sales. For example, in the period leading up to the commercial launch of t:slim X2, we believe there were an increasing number of customers anticipating its availability who delayed their purchasing decisions until they could include t:slim X2 in their decision-making process.\nIn addition, our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expand our business. Accordingly, we may experience substantial variability in our operating results from quarter to quarter. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectation of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially as has occurred over the past several months. Further, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe have concluded that we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through December 31, 2017 and, as a result, the audit report and opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm includes an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe audit report and opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This explanatory paragraph arises from management\u2019s conclusion that our cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to fund our operations through December 31, 2017 without additional financing. Our financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, and does not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to increase our sales and gross profits, our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, and our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from obligations that become due in the ordinary course of business. Management currently believes that it will be necessary for us to raise additional funding in the form of an equity financing from the sale of common stock. However, reports issued by independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s expressing substantial doubt about a company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern are generally viewed unfavorably by current and prospective investors, as well as by analysts and creditors. As a result, this report may make it more difficult for us to raise the additional financing necessary to continue to operate our business. In addition, this report may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and meet our sales forecasts, which may further impede our ability to raise additional financing.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient revenues from the sale of our products or secure additional financing on acceptable terms, we may be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or cease operations altogether. We may also be unable to satisfy covenants in our existing indebtedness if we are unable to secure additional equity financing.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our Term Loan Agreement with Capital Royalty Partners.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $81.1 million aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement with Capital Royalty Partners. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves at the time a scheduled payment becomes due and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. The amount of our cash reserves and our financial and operating performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest on our existing or future indebtedness.\nIf our cash balances or cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or license our assets, sell or reduce our operations, seek additional capital on unfavorable terms, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our recent and projected financial results, the explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm, and general concerns among potential investors and creditors about our financial well-being may make taking such actions on commercially reasonable terms especially difficult. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility, and our potential inability to comply with such covenants puts us at risk of triggering an event of default under the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements or enter into various specified transactions. We may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of Capital Royalty Partners or terminate the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including minimum revenue and cash balance requirements, and financial reporting requirements. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under the Term Loan Agreement. Further, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement.\nThe terms of the Term Loan Agreement also require that we deliver audited financial statements that include an unqualified audit report to Capital Royalty Partners. The audit report and opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph that describes conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This explanatory paragraph in our auditor\u2019s report constitutes a potential event of default under the Term Loan Agreement. As a result, on March 7, 2017, we entered into Waiver and Amendment No. 4 to Term Loan Agreement, or the Fourth Amendment, which includes a limited waiver of a potential event of default that could have resulted from the inclusion of the explanatory paragraph in our auditor\u2019s report. The Fourth Amendment also imposes additional restrictive and financial covenants on us, which may increase our risk of triggering defaults under the Term Loan Agreement. In particular, the Fourth Amendment provides that we must complete a financing in which our gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities is at least $30.0 million no later than January 15, 2018.\nIn the event of a future default triggered by any violations of the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement, including the new covenants in the Fourth Amendment, we will need to obtain additional waivers from Capital Royalty Partners to avoid being in default. If we are unable to obtain additional waivers of those events of default, or amendments to the Term Loan Agreement that would allow us to be in compliance with the terms of the agreement, an event of default would result. In the event of our default under of the Term Loan Agreement, including if we fail to complete a $30.0 million equity financing by January 15, 2018, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated and our capital resources may not be sufficient to meet those obligations. Further, if we are unable to repay our indebtedness and Capital Royalty Partners institutes foreclosure proceedings against our assets, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, and in such a scenario, the values that we receive for our assets could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain.\nWe rely primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary technologies. As of December 31, 2016, our patent portfolio consisted of approximately 50 issued U.S. patents and 50 pending U.S. patent applications. Of these, our issued U.S. patents expire between approximately 2021 and 2035. We also have and are seeking patent protection for our proprietary technologies in other countries throughout the world. In addition, we have one pending U.S. trademark application as well as 23 trademark registrations, including 10 U.S. trademark registrations and 13 foreign trademark registrations.\nWe have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes. If we fail to file a patent application timely in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Further, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all. The rights granted to us under our patents, and the rights we are seeking to have granted in our pending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage. In addition, those rights could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors, or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer the same or similar products or technologies. Even if we are successful in receiving patent protection for certain products and processes, our competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes which are comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. Due to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if patents are granted outside of the United States, effective enforcement in those countries may not be available.\nWe rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our current or future trademark applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all. Third parties also may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote additional resources to marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe have entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers, employees, temporary employees and consultants regarding our intellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of those agreements, we may not be provided with meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nIf a competitor infringes upon one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents, trademarks and other rights may be difficult and time consuming. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change and constant evolution and, consequently, patent positions in our industry can be uncertain. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources or incentive to defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, pursuing litigation may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent litigation, and from time to time, we may be subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, or require us to pay damages.\nOur success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of third parties. Significant litigation regarding patent rights exists in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our products. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent issuances, and the complexities of the technology involved increase the risk of patent litigation.\nFrom time to time, we may receive communications from third parties alleging our infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property dispute or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nstop selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we are allegedly infringing;\n\u25cf\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; or\n\u25cf\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the diabetes market increases, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, or our employees, have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including those that are our direct competitors or could potentially become our direct competitors. In some cases, those employees joined our company recently. We may be subject to claims that we, or our employees, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to allegations that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we successfully defend against these claims, litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. We cannot guarantee that this type of litigation will not continue, and any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize proposed products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, testing and sale of medical devices. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition, injury or death to customers. The risk of one or more product liability claims or lawsuits may be even greater following our January 2014 voluntary recall of cartridges used with t:slim. In addition, the misuse of our products or the failure of customers to adhere to operating guidelines could cause significant harm to customers, including death, which could result in product liability claims. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, with or without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies. Even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy, these policies typically have substantial deductibles for which we are responsible. Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase of our product liability insurance premiums. Insurance coverage varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to protect again potential product liability claims could prevent or limit our commercialization of current products or products currently under development.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nThe medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies. The regulations are very complex and are subject to rapid change and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit our ability to carry on or expand our operations or result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and other U.S. governmental agencies regulate numerous elements of our business, including:\n\u25cf\nproduct design and development;\n\u25cf\npre-clinical and clinical testing and trials;\n\u25cf\nproduct safety;\n\u25cf\nestablishment registration and product listing;\n\u25cf\nlabeling and storage;\n\u25cf\nmarketing, manufacturing, sales and distribution;\n\u25cf\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u25cf\nservicing and post-market surveillance;\n\u25cf\nadvertising and promotion; and\n\u25cf\nrecalls and field safety corrective actions.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. We received approval of our PMA for t:slim G4 in September 2015. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all for our proposed products.\nWe initially received pre-market clearance for t:slim under Section 510(k) of the FDCA in November 2011. We obtained 510(k) clearances for t:connect and t:flex in February 2013 and January 2015, respectively. From time to time, we may make modifications to these products that may require a new 510(k). We have received 510(k) clearance for various modifications to t:slim and its associated cartridge. For instance, in July 2016, we received 510(k) clearance to reduce the age in our indications for use of t:slim to age six. We may pursue 510(k) clearance for additional modifications to t:slim X2 and t:flex in the future. In addition, in July 2016, we received 510(k) clearance for the first use of our Tandem Device Updater. If the FDA requires us to go through a more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline or to not increase in line with our forecasts. We anticipate that our products currently under development will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain PMA approval process.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of one of our devices for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nour inability to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for their intended users;\n\u25cf\nthe data from our clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval; and\n\u25cf\nfailure of the manufacturing process or facilities we use to meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared or approved products on a timely basis.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, warning letters, recalls of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals, and the suspension or withdrawal of existing approvals by the FDA or other regulators. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, we may evaluate international expansion opportunities in the future. If we expand our operations outside of the United States, we will become subject to various additional regulatory and legal requirements under the applicable laws and regulations of the international markets we enter. These additional regulatory requirements may involve significant costs and expenditures and, if we are not able to comply with any such requirements, our international expansion and business could be significantly harmed.\nModifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMAs, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary for changes that we have made to our products. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMAs for modifications to our previously cleared or approved products, for which we concluded that new clearances or approvals were not necessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurther, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of and potential changes to the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to modify our previously cleared products, either by imposing stricter requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations, this could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe and our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may impose inspections or audits at any time. If we or our suppliers have significant non-compliance issues or if any corrective action plan that we or our suppliers propose in response to observed deficiencies is not sufficient, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nA recall of our products, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant negative impact on us.\nThe FDA has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us, one of our distributors or any of our other third-party suppliers could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, under the FDA\u2019s Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nAny adverse event involving any products that we distribute could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and other U.S. federal and state anti-referral laws, could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state physician referral laws, such as the federal \u201cStark Law,\u201d that prohibit a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement;\n\u25cf\nfederal criminal laws enacted as part of HIPAA that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections; and\n\u25cf\nforeign and U.S. state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nFurther, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or, collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. An individual or entity can now be found guilty under the PPACA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that claims submitted in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute automatically constitute false claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Possible sanctions for violation of these laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of those prohibitions. Any violation of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, we may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any of these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether or not retroactive.\nWe may be liable if we engage in the promotion of the off-label use of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition against the promotion of the off-label use of our products. Healthcare providers may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims, which are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may result in downward pressure on the price of and decrease reimbursement for medical devices, and make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of our products.\nRecent political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The sales of our products depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. Both the federal and state governments in the United States continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. This legislation and regulation may result in decreased reimbursement for medical devices, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical devices. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate sales.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for our proposed products would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFederal and state governments in the United States have enacted legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s healthcare system. While the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the PPACA:\n\u25cf\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;\n\u25cf\nimplements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u25cf\ncreates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. Most recently, on August 2, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which commenced in 2013. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of the PPACA and other healthcare reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products. In the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for our products. At this time, we cannot predict which, if any, additional healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they, or the PPACA, may have on our business and operations, and any of these impacts may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the healthcare reform laws.\nBeginning in 2013 through the end of 2015, the PPACA imposed, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Congress suspended this tax on December 18, 2015 for two years, for sales of devices during the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. We do not believe that our products were subject to this tax (prior to its suspension) based on the retail exemption under applicable Treasury Regulations. However, the availability of this exemption is subject to interpretation by the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with our analysis. The future of the medical device tax (and the PPACA generally) is uncertain. If the tax is not repealed and the two-year suspension of the tax is not extended beyond 2017, future products that we manufacture, produce or import may be subject to this tax (unless the retail exemption or other applicable exemption applies). The financial impact this tax may have on our business is unclear and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by it.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nBecause of their significant stock ownership, certain of our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will be able to exert control over our company and our significant corporate decisions.\nBased on an aggregate of 31,095,598 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016, our executive officers and directors, and their affiliates owned, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThe interests of the aforementioned stockholders might not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our capital stock. This concentration of ownership may reduce the value of our common stock by, among other things:\n\u25cf\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company;\n\u25cf\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n\u25cf\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could reduce our stock price and prevent our stockholders from replacing or removing our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to our common stock, which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nprovide for the adoption of a staggered board of directors whereby the board is divided into three classes each of which has a different three-year term;\n\u25cf\nprovide that the number of directors shall be fixed by the board;\n\u25cf\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies;\n\u25cf\nprovide for the removal of a director only with cause and then by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares;\n\u25cf\nprohibit stockholders from calling special stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\nprohibit stockholders from acting by written consent without holding a meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nrequire the vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares to approve amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue 5,000,000 shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, and the issuance of such shares in the future may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $283.5 million, not considering the limitation discussed below. The federal tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026, unless previously utilized. In general, if there is an \u201cownership change\u201d with respect to our company, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the utilization of our NOL carryforwards may be subject to substantial limitations imposed by the Code, and similar state provisions. In general, an ownership change occurs whenever there is a shift in ownership of our company by more than 50% by one or more 5% stockholders over a specified time period.\nAlthough we have not completed an update of our Section 382 analysis subsequent to December 31, 2013, the offering that we conducted in March of 2015, either separately or together with any future equity financing, may have caused or could cause an ownership change or could increase the likelihood that we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOL carryforwards to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOL carryforwards.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, we are precluded from paying any cash dividends. Accordingly, investors may have to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Investors may not receive a gain on their investment when they sell their shares of our common stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nThe requirements of being a public company have increased our costs and will continue to strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increased demand on our systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Recent legislation permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d to implement many of these requirements over a period of up to five years after becoming subject to the requirements. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses.\nIn order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to help us comply with these requirements, in the future we may need to hire more employees or utilize external consultants in order to further support our efforts, which will increase our expenses.\nRegulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nThe SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and annually report to the SEC whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We continue to investigate the use of conflict materials, if any, within our supply chain.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we do not know whether the reduced disclosure requirements and relief from certain other significant obligations that are applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d These exemptions include the following:\n\u25cf\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf\nless extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25cf\nexemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe intend to take advantage of these exemptions but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, which could result in a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made to our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years from our November 2013 initial public offering. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nThe price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cTNDM.\u201d Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results, including the financial and accounting impacts of the Technology Upgrade Program;\n\u25cf\nour actual or perceived need for additional capital to fund our operations;\n\u25cf\nperceptions about the market acceptance of our products and the recognition of our brand;\n\u25cf\nperceptions about our financial stability relative to our competitors and our ability to sustain our business operations long term;\n\u25cf\nthe reaction of investors to our conclusion that if we do not successfully raise additional capital there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of proposed products, or announcements of significant contracts, licenses or acquisitions, by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nlegislative, political or regulatory developments;\n\u25cf\nissuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u25cf\nsale of shares of our common stock by us or members of our management; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of shares of our common stock could materially reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of our shares intend to sell such shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock, which would impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We had outstanding 31,095,598 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately 11,985,636 shares are restricted securities that may be sold only in accordance with the resale restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase 8,228,387 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 990,031 shares of common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale. As of December 31, 2016, there was also 562,282 shares and 78,459 shares of our common stock reserved for future grant or issuance under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, and our 2013 Employee Stock Purchas Plan, or our ESPP, respectively.\nCertain holders of shares of common stock have the right, subject to various conditions and limitations, to include their shares in registration statements relating to our securities. In addition, these holders are entitled to piggyback registration rights with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of shares of our common stock. Shares of common stock registered under these registration statements can be freely sold in the public market. In the event registration rights are exercised and a large number of shares of common stock are sold in the public market, those sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional securities if we need to raise more capital. In particular, management currently believes that it will be necessary for us to raise additional funding in the form of an equity financing from the sale of common stock. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14325, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "TNDM"}
