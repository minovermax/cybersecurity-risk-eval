{"cik": "708821", "company": "PAR TECHNOLOGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A\nRisk Factors.\nOur business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur yearly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of our revenue recognition and our ability to accurately forecast sales, including subscription software sales and renewals.\nOur revenues and other results of operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future as our business model continues to evolve from hardware and related services to a management technology solutions provider, including offering and delivering our software as a service - SaaS. As revenues from our cloud offerings increase, we may experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our SaaS offerings and our traditional on-premises software and hardware sales. The SaaS delivery model is subscription based; accordingly, SaaS revenues are generally recognized ratably over the life of the subscription. In contrast, revenue from our on-premises software and hardware sales is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery. Accordingly, the SaaS business model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition not associated with our traditional on-premises delivery model. A portion of our quarterly SaaS based revenue results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our SaaS business model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.\nIf our technical and maintenance support services are not satisfactory to our customers, they may not renew their services agreements or buy future products, which could adversely affect our future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur business relies on our customers\u2019 satisfaction with the technical and maintenance support services we provide to support our products. If we fail to provide technical and maintenance support services that are responsive, satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations and resolve issues that they encounter with our products, then they may not purchase additional products or services from us in the future.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nMuch of our future success depends on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management. Experienced personnel in the management technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in the skill-set we require. Moreover, we believe that a critical contributor to our success is our corporate culture and values. We must not only successfully attract and retain qualified business, technical, product development and other employees that contribute to our business, we must attract and retain qualified employees who embrace and reflect our culture and values. Our failure to do so, could adversely affect our ability to innovate, to rapidly and effectively change and introduce new products, and to provide timely and effective installation, technical and maintenance support services, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThe price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our actual operating performance.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Although our stock has been listed on NYSE for many years, trading in our stock does not generally occur in high volumes and the market for our stock cannot always be characterized as active. Thin trading in our stock may exaggerate fluctuations in the stock\u2019s value, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market. In addition, the stock market in general is subject to fluctuations that affect the share prices and trading volumes of many companies, and these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect our common stock price in the future include but are not necessarily limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nthe performance and prospects of our major customers;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe concentrated beneficial ownership of our common stock by our founder, Dr. John W. Sammon;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated regulatory action against us;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of earnings guidance and securities analysts following us;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and the industries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty regarding domestic and international political conditions, including tax policies; and\n\u00b7\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies.\nTwo customers account for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of one of these customers, or a significant reduction, delay, or cancellation of purchases by one of these customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRevenues from our Restaurant/Retail segment constituted 65% and 62% of our total consolidated revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively; and, aggregate sales to our two largest customers, which include sales to these two customers\u2019 respective franchisees - McDonald\u2019s Corporation and Yum! Brands, Inc., which consists of the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands - constituted 25% (McDonald\u2019s) and 11% (Yum!) and 19% (McDonald\u2019s) and 10% (Yum!) of total consolidated revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no other customers that comprised greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenues during these years. A loss of McDonald\u2019s or Yum! Brands as a customer, or a significant reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders by one of these customers would reduce our revenue and operating income and would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face extensive competition in our markets, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products.\nThe markets for our POS software and hardware products are characterized by rapid technological advances, intense competition among existing and emerging competitors, evolving industry standards, emerging business, distribution and support models, disruptive technology developments, and frequent new product introductions.\nWhile we think our POS software and hardware products offer competitive, innovative features and functionality, any one of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect sales to our existing customers, as well as our ability to attract and sell to new customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and identify changes in customer needs and/or relevant technologies and to rapidly and effectively change and improve our products in response, including changes in operating systems, application software and computer and communications hardware, with which our products interoperate or their performance and functionality are otherwise affected. If we fail to anticipate and/or identify changes in customer needs and/or emerging relevant technological trends, our business, results of operations and financial conditions could suffer. Additionally, any delay in the development, marketing, or launch of new products or enhancements to our existing products could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\nOur government contracting business has been focused on niche offerings, reflecting our expertise, primarily in the areas of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, systems engineering & evaluation, satellite and telecommunications services and management technology/systems services. Many of our competitors in the Government segment are larger and have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. We also compete with smaller companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential \u201cset aside\u201d treatment, that target particular segments of the government market and may have superior capabilities in a particular segment. These companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals. Consequently, there are no assurances we will continue to win government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor, and our failure to do so, would reduce our revenue and operating income and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe consequence of our internal investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nUnder the oversight of our Audit Committee, in the first quarter of 2016, we conducted an internal investigation of our former chief financial officer\u2019s unauthorized investment activities and, we are currently conducting an internal investigation to determine whether certain import/export and sales documentation activities at our China and Singapore offices were improper and in possible violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other applicable laws, and certain of our policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nWe voluntarily notified the SEC of our investigation (and our findings and conclusions) of our former chief financial officer; and, we have voluntarily notified the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, of our investigation of the activities concerning China and Singapore, and we are fully cooperating with these agencies. If the SEC, DOJ, or other governmental agencies (including foreign governmental agencies) were to determine that violations of certain laws or regulations occurred, then we could be exposed to a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions, including injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties, modifications to our business practices, including the termination or modification of existing business relationships, the imposition of compliance programs and the retention of a monitor to oversee our future compliance. While we are currently unable to predict what actions the SEC, DOJ, or other governmental agencies (including foreign governmental agencies) might take, or what the likely outcome of any such actions might be, or estimate the range of reasonably possible fines or penalties, such actions, fines and/or penalties could be material, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. Even if an inquiry or investigation does not result in an adverse determination, our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows could still be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to correct the identified material weaknesses, and maintain appropriate internal controls, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs described in \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report during the third quarter of 2016, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We previously disclosed identified material weaknesses in our hiring and treasury procedures, which have been remedied. If we fail to correct our current material weaknesses; or, if we are unable to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC could be adversely affected, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. Any such consequence or other negative effect could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with compliance with international laws and regulations which may harm our business\nAlthough only 8% for 2016 and 14% for 2015 of our total consolidated revenues were derived from sales outside of the U.S., we have operations across the globe, and our international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our software and hardware in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including fines, penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nincreased risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries and practical difficulties and costs of enforcing rights abroad;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty around a potential reverse or renegotiation of international trade agreements and partnerships under President Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration;\n\u00b7\nsales and customer service challenges associated with operating in different countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in receiving payments from different geographies, including difficulties associated with currency fluctuations, payment cycles, transfer of funds or collecting accounts receivable, especially in emerging markets;\n\u00b7\nvariations in economic or political conditions between each country or region;\n\u00b7\neconomic uncertainty around the world and adverse effects arising from economic interdependencies across countries and regions;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty around how the United Kingdom\u2019s recent decision to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) will impact its access to the European Union Single Market, the related regulatory environment, the global economy, and the resulting impact on our business; and\n\u00b7\nincreased infrastructure and legal compliance costs.\nA portion of Government segment revenue is derived from U.S. government contracts, which contain provisions unique to public sector customers, including the U.S. government\u2019s right to modify or terminate these contracts at any time.\nIn 2016 and 2015 we derived 35% and 38%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues from contracts to provide technical expertise to government organizations and prime contractors. In any given year, the majority of our government contracting activity is associated with the U.S. Department of Defense. Contracts with the U.S. government typically provide that such contracts are terminable, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. government. If the U.S. government terminates a contract on this basis, we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and, in general, a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed. Most U.S. government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding. As such, we may perform work prior to formal authorization, or the contract prices may be adjusted for changes in scope of work. Termination or modification of a substantial number of our U.S. government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe perform work for various U.S. government agencies and departments pursuant to fixed-price, cost-plus fixed fee and time-and-material prime contracts and subcontracts. Approximately 55% of revenues derived from government contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016, was based on fixed-price or time-and- material contracts, and the balance (approximately 45% of total government revenues) was based on cost-plus fixed fee contracts. Most of our contracts are for one-year to five-year terms.\nWhile fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use for calculating the contract price are incorrect, we can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of our governmental contracts have provisions relating to cost controls, and audit rights and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize the full benefit of the contracts. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nUnder time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee. If our costs under either of these types of contracts were to exceed the contract ceiling, or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be reimbursed for 100% of our associated costs. Our inability to control our costs under either a time-and-materials contract or a cost-plus fixed fee contract could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Cost over-runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.\nA portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and identifiable and intangible assets, which are subject to a periodic impairment analysis, a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, even without a significant loss of our revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nOur goodwill was approximately $11.1 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and our intangibles were $11.0 million at December 31, 2016 and $10.9 million at December 31, 2015. Identifiable intangible assets were, primarily a result of business acquisitions and internally developed capitalized software. We test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We describe the impairment testing process and results of this testing more thoroughly in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d If we determine an impairment has occurred at any point in time, we will be required to reduce goodwill or identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. Additional information about our impairment testing is contained in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report).", "PERMNO": 61146, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "PAR"}
