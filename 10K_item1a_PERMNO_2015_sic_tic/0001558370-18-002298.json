Risk Factors\nThe Exit Facility and our liquidity upon emergence will limit our available funding for exploration and development. We may have difficulty obtaining additional credit, which could adversely affect our operations and financial position.\nHistorically, our Predecessor depended on the Prepetition Revolving Credit Facility for a portion of its capital needs. On the Emergence Date, by operation of the Plan, all outstanding obligations under Prepetition Revolving Credit Facility, the related collateral agreement and the credit agreements governing such obligations were cancelled.\nPursuant to the Plan, on the Emergence Date, the Company, as Borrower, and the other Reorganized Debtors entered into the Exit Facility, which consists of two facilities: (i) an Exit Term Loan facility resulting from the conversion of the remaining drawn amount plus accrued default interest, fees and expenses under the Debtors\u2019 Prepetition Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $74 million and (ii) the Exit Revolving Facility resulting from the conversion of the former EGC tranche of the Prepetition Revolving Credit Facility which provides for the making of revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit. On the Emergence Date, the aggregate commitments under the Exit Revolving Facility were approximately $227.8 million, all of which was utilized to maintain in effect outstanding letters of credit, including $225 million of letters of credit issued in favor of ExxonMobil to secure certain plugging and abandonment obligations.\nWe may not be able to access adequate funding in the future as there is limited remaining available borrowing capacity contemplated under the Exit Facility. There is no certainty that any new capacity will be created or that the Exit Facility may be refinanced on economically advantageous terms.\nAs a complement to the Company\u2019s capital plan, including the 2018 Capital Budget, the Company has retained Intrepid Partners LLC to assist with the consideration of possible alternatives for raising additional capital. No determination has yet been made as to the form or amount of any such additional capital, but it could be in the form of debt, convertible debt, additional common stock or a new series of non-convertible or convertible preferred stock, as well as other financing structures. There can be no assurance that any such capital-raising transaction will be consummated or, if consummated, when that transaction will occur. Furthermore, the Company intends that any such financing would be structured in such a way that it would not preclude a strategic transaction.\nIf funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, it could adversely affect (i) our ability to maintain our infrastructure, particularly in light of its maturity, high fixed costs, and required level of maintenance and repairs compared to other GoM Shelf producers, (ii) our development plans as currently anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues, results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to develop our proved undeveloped reserves within the five year period required by the SEC, and (iii) our ability to meet our other obligations, including plugging and abandonment and decommissioning obligations.\nThe securities that may be issued by the Company as part of its current capital raise activities could have a dilutive effect to stockholders of the Company.\nWith respect to the Company\u2019s current capital raise activities, no determination has yet been made as to the form that any such additional capital would take, but it could be in the form of debt, convertible debt, additional common stock or a new series of non-convertible or convertible preferred stock, as well as other financing structures. The securities, if any, that are issued in order to raise capital could have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our stockholders of the Company.\nTrading in our shares may be limited in volume, our stock price may be volatile and holders of our common stock may be unable to sell shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nSince our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ on February 28, 2017 through March 2, 2018, the closing stock price for our common stock has ranged from $4.74 per share to $35.96 per share. Because of the limited trading volume in our shares, the ability of investors to purchase or sell shares may be constrained. Furthermore, the market\nprice of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Plan, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, strategic actions by us or our competitors, changes in government regulations, arrival and departure of key personnel, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Form 10-K.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in stock offerings.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. Further, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of those investors pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. That registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on March 23, 2017. Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur, could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. For more information, please read Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-Plan of Reorganization-Equity Interests.\u201d\nWe are currently authorized to issue 100 million shares of common stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock of the Company with such designations, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as determined by the Board. As of March 2, 2018, we had outstanding approximately 33.3 million shares of common stock and 2.1 million warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2.1 million shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $43.66 per share of common stock. We have also reserved approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for future issuance to our directors, officers and employees as restricted stock, stock option or any other stock based compensation awards pursuant to Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 LTIP\u201d), and may seek to reserve additional shares in the future. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the future trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue common stock or other equity securities senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance acquisitions, to adjust our leverage ratio and to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of warrants, other equity securities or for other reasons. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuances of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or the availability of shares of common stock or such other equity securities for future sale or issuance, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nA new board of directors was appointed upon our emergence from bankruptcy, a new Chief Operating Officer began on February 2, 2017, a new President and Chief Executive Officer began on April 17, 2017, a new Chief Financial Officer began on August 24, 2017 and several directors have resigned from, or stated their intention not to stand for re-election to, the board of directors in recent months. The transition in our new board of directors and senior management team will be critical to our success.\nPursuant to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, a new board of directors was appointed on the effective date of the Plan. At emergence, the new board was made up of six directors, and none of the new directors had previously served on the Board of the Predecessor Company. On February 2, 2017, we hired Scott M. Heck and appointed him to serve as our Chief Operating Officer of the Company, on April 17, 2017, we hired Douglas E. Brooks and appointed him as our new Chief Executive Officer and President, and on August 24, 2017, we hired T.J. Thom Cepak and appointed her to serve as our Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In the last four months, George Kollitides and James W. Swent\nIII, two of our independent directors have resigned because of their other professional commitments. Additionally, Michael S. Reddin, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, notified the Company on February 17, 2018 of his decision not to stand for re-election as a director of the Company. The ability of our new directors, the new Chief Executive Officer, new Chief Operating Officer and the new Chief Financial Officer to quickly expand their knowledge of our business plans, operations and strategies and our technologies will be critical to their ability to make informed decisions about our strategy and operations. If our Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer are not sufficiently informed to make such decisions, or have different views on the direction of the Company and other issues that will determine the future of the Company, our ability to compete effectively and profitably could be adversely affected and the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nOur success depends on dedicated and skillful management and staff, whose departure could disrupt our business operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers, geoscientists and other professional staff. We depend to a large extent on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team. Any departures of key management or staff could cause disruptions in our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries believe we have provided the BOEM with all bonds or other surety in order to maintain compliance with BOEM regulations, although additional bonds could be required which may be costly and could potentially have negative impact on operating cash flows.\nTo ensure that the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells, decommission and remove platforms and pipelines, and to clear the seafloor of obstructions at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met. Historically, the BOEM and its predecessors could exempt the lessees from posting such bonds or other assurances for the performance of these decommissioning obligations. However, following the bankruptcy of another Gulf of Mexico operator in 2012, the BOEM commenced a reassessment of its offshore financial assurance program. In July 2016, the agency issued its September 2016 NTL that revised requirements for the posting of additional security to satisfy decommissioning obligations. Additionally, the September 2016 NTL eliminated the exemption from the posting of financial assurances. On January 6, 2017, the BOEM announced its January 2017 Extension. This January 2017 Extension of time applied to leases, rights-of-way and rights of use and easement for which there are co-lessees and/or predecessors in interest. On February 17, 2017, the BOEM announced that it was withdrawing orders issued in December 2016 to operators of \u201csole liability properties\u201d - leases, rights-of-way and rights of use and easement for which the holder is the only liable party - to allow additional time for review of its financial assurance program. On June 22, 2017, the BOEM extended the timeline for implementation of the September 2016 NTL indefinitely.\nWe are a lessee and operator of oil and natural gas leases on the OCS and consequently, as of December 31, 2017, we have submitted approximately $182.4 million in performance bonds in the form of general or supplemental bonds to the BOEM that may be accessed and used by the BOEM to assure our commitment to comply with our lease obligations, including decommissioning obligations. We also maintained approximately $151.7 million in performance bonds issued not to the BOEM but rather to predecessor third party assignors, including certain state regulatory bodies for certain of the wells and facilities on these leases pursuant to a contractual commitment made by us to those third parties at the time of assignment with respect to the eventual decommissioning of those wells and facilities. In addition, we may be required to provide cash collateral to third party assignors and third party sureties in connection with these performance bonds.\nThe future cost of compliance with our existing supplemental bonding requirements, including such bonding obligations as reflected in the long-term financial assurance plan (\u201cLong-Term Plan\u201d) approved and executed by the BOEM on February 25, 2016, as such plan may be revised by the amended and supplemental plan submitted to the BOEM on June 28, 2016 (the \u201cProposed Plan Amendment\u201d), or any other changes to the BOEM\u2019s current NTL supplemental bonding requirements or supplemental bonding rules applicable to us or our subsidiaries\u2019 properties could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to provide cash collateral to support the issuance of such bonds or other surety. While we and the BOEM have executed the Long-Term Plan, we have since submitted the Proposed Plan Amendment for the agency\u2019s consideration\nand approval that would revise the Long-Term Plan. We can provide no assurance that we can continue in the future to obtain bonds or other surety or that we will have sufficient operating cash flows to support such supplemental bonding requirements. If we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds as requested, the BSEE or the BOEM may have any of our operations on federal leases suspended or cancelled or otherwise impose monetary penalties, and any one or more of such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For more information about the BOEM\u2019s supplement bonding requirements, see \u201c-Known Trends and Uncertainties-BOEM Supplemental Financial Assurance and/or Bonding Requirements.\u201d\nUnanticipated decommissioning costs could materially adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe may become responsible for unanticipated increases to or acceleration of costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines. Abandonment and reclamation of facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d Should decommissioning be required that is not presently anticipated or the decommissioning be accelerated, such as can happen after a hurricane, such costs may exceed the value of reserves remaining at any particular time. We may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Please also read \u201c-We and our subsidiaries believe we have provided the BOEM with all bonds or other surety in order to maintain compliance with BOEM regulations, although additional bonds could be required which may be costly and could potentially have negative impact on operating cash flows.\u201d\nWe are limited in our ability to book proved undeveloped reserves under the SEC\u2019s rules.\nWe have included in this Form 10-K certain estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 prepared in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the SEC rules relating to reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. Current SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. For example, in connection with our most recent reserve report, we removed approximately 6 BOE of proved undeveloped reserves because of this five-year rule.\nDelays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves reduce the present value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. Please read \u201cBusiness-Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves.\u201d\nProduction periods or reserve lives for Gulf of Mexico properties may subject us to higher reserve replacement needs and may impair our ability to reduce production during periods of low oil and natural gas prices.\nHigh production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during their initial years of operation when compared to other regions in the U.S. Typically, 50% of the reserves of properties in the Gulf of Mexico are depleted within three to four years, with natural gas wells generally having a higher rate of depletion than oil wells. Due to high initial production rates, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from other producing reservoirs. The vast majority of our existing operations are in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater than those of other oil and gas companies with longer-life reserves in other producing areas. Also, our expected revenues and return on capital will depend on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods. Our need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or repay debt may limit our ability to slow or shut in production from producing wells during periods of low prices for oil and natural gas.\nUnless we replace crude oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nA large portion of our drilling activity is located in mature oil-producing areas of the GoM Shelf. Accordingly, increases in our future crude oil and natural gas production depend on our success in developing, finding or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable. If we are unable to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions on economic terms, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected. In general, production\nfrom oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves may be impaired if cash flow from operations remains limited and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. We also may not be successful in raising funds to explore for, develop or acquire additional reserves.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results and impede our growth.\nOil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, oil prices declined severely during 2015 with continued lower prices into 2016 and 2017. The WTI crude oil price per barrel for the period from October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 ranged from a high of $91.01 to a low of $26.21, and the New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) natural gas price per MMBtu for the period October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017 ranged from a high of $4.49 to a low of $1.64. As of December 31, 2017, the spot market price for WTI was $60.42. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u00b7\nlevel of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u00b7\nlevel of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nlevel of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, Africa and Russia;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u00b7\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of alternative fuels.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position, the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds through the capital markets.\nLower oil and gas prices and other factors may result in future ceiling test write-downs of our asset carrying values.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting at the end of each financial reporting period we compare the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (computed using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month historical price, net of applicable differentials, for each month within the previous 12-month period discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs associated with developed properties) to the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of related deferred income taxes. We refer to this comparison as a \u201cceiling test.\u201d If the net capitalized costs of these oil and natural gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows, we are required to write-down the value of our oil and natural gas properties to the amount of the discounted cash flows. Declines in oil prices may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations include the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe are required to record a liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive, non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than being structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane.\nMoreover, current operators in the Gulf of Mexico are required to commence decommissioning activities more quickly than was the case prior to the issuance of an NTL in 2010 by the Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management and Regulation (now BSEE) addressing the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron\u201d: wells, platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions with respect to an operator\u2019s lease. The idle iron NTL requires that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on active leases and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years\u2019 time, with a two-year delay of such activities available under certain circumstances. Platforms or other facilities no longer useful for operations must be removed within five years of the cessation of operations. The triggering of these plugging, abandonment and removal activities under what may be viewed as an accelerated schedule in comparison to historical decommissioning efforts may serve to increase, perhaps materially, our future plugging, abandonment and removal costs, which may translate into a need to increase our estimate of future asset retirement obligations required to meet such increased costs.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of our future net cash flows from our proved reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on average prices for the preceding 12 month period and costs in effect at the time of the estimate. Unless average commodity prices or reserves increase, the estimated discounted\nfuture net cash flows from our proved reserves would generally be expected to decrease. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nsupply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe volume, pricing and duration of any future oil and natural gas hedging contracts;\n\u00b7\nour actual operating costs in producing oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of our capital expenditures and decommissioning costs;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. Estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates will materially affect the quantities and values of our reserves. It requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions, including price and other economic conditions. In preparing such estimates, projection of production rates, timing of development expenditures and available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data are analyzed. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. This process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. If our or our independent reserve engineering firm\u2019s interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at estimates of our reserves prove to be inaccurate, the amount of oil and natural gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us. Any inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could also materially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in the reserve reports summarized in this Form 10-K. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, decommissioning liabilities and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from estimates. In addition, the estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 11% of our total proved reserves were developed non-producing. There can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be produced.\nWhile we have plans or are in the process of developing plans for exploiting and producing a majority of our proved reserves, there can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be produced. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our developed non-producing reserves will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have estimated, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nMost of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nWe own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have leases on 502 gross acres (251 net) that could potentially expire during fiscal year 2018. We have limited capital to develop leases not currently held by production, or to re-lease or replace expiring leases.\nOur drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling, therefore there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nWe are not the operator on all of our properties and therefore are not in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs, or the rate of production of the reserves on such properties.\nWe operated approximately 89% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2017. However, with respect to the remaining 11% of our proved reserves, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties or their associated costs. Dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects, and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\napproval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u00b7\nselection of technology; and\n\u00b7\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nEach of these factors and others could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nAny future unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute exploration and exploitation plans on a timely basis and within budget, and consequently could adversely affect our anticipated cash flow.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oil field services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Any future shortages or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our exploitation and exploration operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nUnlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we do not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By operating only in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast, our lack of diversification may:\n\u00b7\nsubject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\nresult in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins.\nIn addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast means that some or all of the properties could be affected should the region experience:\n\u00b7\nsevere weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory environment.\nBecause all or a number of the properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nThe properties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the acquired properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nOur business strategy includes the potential acquisition of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. The successful acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u00b7\nacceptable prices for available properties;\n\u00b7\namounts of recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;\n\u00b7\nestimates of the costs and timing of decommissioning obligations; and\n\u00b7\nestimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment of the acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we historically have not physically inspected every well, platform or pipeline. Even if we had physically inspected each of these, our inspections may not have revealed structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion offshore. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities associated with such risks. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. If an acquired property does not perform as\noriginally estimated, we may have an impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to benefit from or successfully integrate the operations of the properties or businesses we acquire.\nIntegration of the operations of the properties we acquire with our existing business is a complex, time-consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and operations in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The difficulties of combining the acquired operations include, among other things:\n\u00b7\noperating a larger organization;\n\u00b7\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u00b7\nintegrating corporate, technological and administrative functions;\n\u00b7\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\ndiverting financial resources away from existing operations;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nincurring potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nThe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, we face the risk of identifying, competing for and pursuing other acquisitions, which takes time and expense and diverts management\u2019s attention from other activities.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions, such as increased earnings, cost savings and revenue enhancements, for reasons in addition to the integration risk, including higher than expected acquisition and operating costs or other difficulties, unknown liabilities, inaccurate reserve estimates and fluctuations in market prices, including with respect to commodity prices such as for oil and natural gas.\nNew regulatory initiatives imposing more stringent environmental or safety-related requirements could cause us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which could be significant.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or the re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal or remediation requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the partnership\u2019s financial position and the drilling program\u2019s results of operations. For example, during October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. The EPA established initial attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards on November 16, 2017. In a second example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was\nfinalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes generated from exploration and production activities. With regard to safety-related requirements, the BSEE published a final rule in April 2016 mandating more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for critical well control equipment used in oil and natural gas operations on the OCS. Among other things, this final rule imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deep water and high-temperature, high-pressure drilling activities, establishment of safe drilling margins with respect to downhole mud weights that may be used during drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements to regulators. These recent regulatory initiatives, or any other future laws, rules or initiatives, which impose more stringent environmental or safety-related requirements in connection with our offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our services, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe nature of our business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nWe engage in exploration and development drilling activities in the GoM Shelf, which activities are inherently risky. These activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons. In addition to a failure to find oil or natural gas, drilling efforts can be affected by adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Therefore, the successful drilling of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, could cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells could impede our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur business involves a variety of operating risks, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nexplosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of gas, oil and formation water;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7\ncasing collapses;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses due to costs and/or liability incurred as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepairs to resume operations.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could affect our operations adversely.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties. In particular, we do not carry business interruption insurance due to its high cost. We therefore may not be able to rely on insurance coverage in the event of such natural phenomena.\nOur insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nWe maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Due to market conditions, including with respect to commodity prices such as for oil and natural gas, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies are economically unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consistent with industry practice, we are not fully insured against all risks, including business interruption and drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If storm activity in the future is severe, insurance underwriters may not offer the type and level of coverage previously insured, and costs and retentions may increase substantially. In addition, we do not have, and it is unlikely we will obtain, business interruption insurance due to its high cost. If an accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a vendor, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that could give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors include larger independent oil and gas companies that possess and employ financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel\nresources than ours. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. The competitors may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices, such as the current commodity price environment, and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. Further, our competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will impact attaining success in the industry. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nMarket conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to oil and natural gas markets, delay production or increase our costs.\nMarket conditions (including with respect to commodity prices such as for oil and natural gas), the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the remote location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production. The availability of a ready market for oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities. We may be required to shut in wells or delay production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity. Restrictions on our ability to sell our oil and natural gas may have several other adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production. In the event that we encounter restrictions in our ability to tie our production to a gathering system, we may face considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues. In some cases, our wells may be tied back to platforms owned by parties with no economic interests in these wells. There can be no assurance that owners of such platforms will continue to operate the platforms. If the owners cease to operate the platforms or their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our vendors, customers and by counterparties to our price risk management arrangements. Some of our vendors, customers and counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our vendors, customers and counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. From time to time, the availability of credit is more restrictive. Additionally, many of our vendors\u2019, customers\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 equity values have substantially declined. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our vendors, customers and counterparties liquidity and ability to make payments or perform their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our vendors, customers and/or counterparties could reduce our cash flows.\nWe sell the majority of our production to four customers.\nChevron, Shell, Plains and Trafigura accounted for approximately 26%, 25%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our total oil and natural gas revenues during the 12 month period ended December 31, 2017. Our inability to continue to sell our production to Chevron, Shell, Plains or Trafigura, if not offset by sales to new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur future price risk management activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe historically have entered into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of oil and natural gas price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Historically, we have used a combination of crude oil and natural gas put, swap and collar arrangements to mitigate the volatility of future oil and natural gas prices received on our production.\nUnder any price risk management activities that we may enter in in the future, our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial decrease in our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, our price risk management activities are subject to the following risks:\n\u00b7\na counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument;\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than expected; and\n\u00b7\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received.\nDuring periods of declining commodity prices, our commodity price derivative positions may increase, which would increase our counterparty exposure.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls that, if not properly corrected, could result in us being unable to provide required financial information in a timely and reliable manner.\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe did not maintain operating effectiveness of our controls over the subsequent accounting for the effects of certain legacy purchase and sale contracts on our recorded asset retirement obligations. In periods prior to emergence from bankruptcy, the Company, in connection with certain purchase and sale agreements, transferred and/or assumed certain plugging and abandonment liabilities that were not subsequently accounted for properly within the asset retirement obligations account balance. While these errors originated during periods prior to emergence from bankruptcy, controls in place at December 31, 2017 did not identify and correct the errors.\nIf we are not able to remedy the control deficiencies in a timely manner, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner, either of which could subject us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for periods after our emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to December 31, 2016.\nOn the Convenience Date, we adopted fresh start accounting as a result of the reorganization as prescribed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the provisions of FASB, ASC 852, Reorganizations. As required by fresh start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value by allocating the reorganization value determined in connection with the Plan. Accordingly, our financial condition and\nresults of operations from and after the Convenience Date are not comparable, in various material respects, to the financial condition and results of operations prior to the Convenience Date.\nAs a result of the Plan and subsequent income tax filings, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) available prior to emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings were completely eliminated, and the tax basis of our assets was substantially reduced.\nUnder the Tax Code, a debtor that realizes cancellation of indebtedness income (\u201cCODI\u201d) pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court approved plan of reorganization may exclude this income from taxation in the year/period of the discharge. However, the tax attributes of such a debtor are reduced to the extent that CODI is excluded from gross income pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases (the \u201cTax Attribute Reduction Rules\u201d). As a result, the CODI recognized for tax purposes upon the Predecessor\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11 and all of its consolidated NOL carryforwards have been eliminated and other tax attributes (principally, the tax bases of our oil and natural gas properties subject to future recovery against taxable income via tax depreciation, depletion and amortization) have been substantially reduced under the Tax Attribute Reduction Rules. As a result, depending on future operations and drilling activity, the Company may be subject to paying cash income taxes in periods after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAdditional offshore drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans, and other related developments in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, the BSEE and BOEM have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response, and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are developing and implementing new, more restrictive requirements. For example, in April 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deep water and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, establishment of safe drilling margins with respect to downhole mud weights that may be used during drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements to regulators. Also, in April 2016, the BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural gas activity on the OCS. The BOEM regulates these air emissions in connection with its review of exploration and development plans, and right-of-way and rights of use and easement applications. The proposed rule would bolster existing air emission requirement by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare that, depending on the results obtained, could result in subsequent rulemakings that restrict offshore air emissions. The BOEM also issued the September 2016 NTL that imposes more stringent requirements relating to the provision of financial assurance to satisfy decommissioning obligations. Among other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas or cause us to incur penalties, fines or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nIf we are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease operations altogether.\nThe construction and operation of energy projects require numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies. In addition, many governmental agencies have increased regulatory oversight and permitting requirements in recent years. We may not be able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals or obtain them in a timely manner, and as a result our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals, future changes to these permits or approvals, or any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals, and these may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to proceed as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and other government laws and regulations that are costly and could potentially subject us to substantial liabilities.\nAs described in more detail below, our business activities are subject to regulation by multiple federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our historical and projected operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations, and we do not anticipate material expenditures in excess of these amounts in the absence of future acquisitions or changes in regulation, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and gas industries are regularly considered by the U.S. Congress, the states, regulatory commissions and agencies, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business; however, additions or enhancements to the regulatory burden on our industry generally increase the cost of doing business and affect our profitability.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations may result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.\nAll of the jurisdictions in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, drilling or performance bonds, and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Those jurisdictions also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of certain jurisdictions also limit the rate at which oil and natural gas can be produced from our properties.\nFERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and terms of service, which affect the marketing of gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, FERC has issued various orders that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of natural gas. These orders resulted in a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales services such pipelines previously performed. These FERC actions were designed to increase competition within all phases of the gas industry. The interstate regulatory framework may enhance our ability to market and transport our gas, although it may also subject us to greater competition and to the more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such tolerances.\nOur sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are not presently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of those products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. FERC has implemented regulations establishing an indexing methodology for interstate transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would index such rate to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations\nmay, over time, tend to increase transportation costs which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and NGLs.\nUnder the EPAct 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional entities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements, as described more fully in Item 1 above. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nAlthough FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine if a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation, however, and, over time, FERC\u2019s policy for determining which facilities it regulates has changed. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission facilities, on the one hand, and gathering facilities, on the other, is a fact-based determination made by FERC on a case-by-case basis. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (\u201cNGPA\u201d). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nState regulation of gathering facilities includes safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Our gathering operations may also be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes, designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another. State and local regulation may cause us to incur additional costs or limit our operations and can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7\nrequire the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or another regulated activity commences;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u00b7\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and\n\u00b7\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\nincurring investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of delays in permitting or performance or expansion of projects; and\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, which could prohibit, limit or restrict our operations in a particular area.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations or how they are interpreted or applied occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. While, historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. In addition, the risk of accidental spills, leakages or other circumstances could expose us to extensive liability.\nUnder certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability, we could be held liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, and regardless of whether current or prior operations were conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and consistent with accepted standards of practice at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations. Such liabilities can be significant, and if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future, including whether any such laws or regulations would materially adversely increase our cost of doing business or affect operations in any area.\nRate regulation may not allow us to recover the full amount of increases in our costs.\nWe have ownership interests in oil pipelines that are subject to regulation by FERC. Rates for service on our system are set using FERC\u2019s price indexing methodology. The indexing method currently allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage factor equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 2.65 percent. When the index falls, we are required to reduce rates if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate. In addition, changes in the index might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in our costs.\nFERC\u2019s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. The current or any revised indexing formula could hamper our ability to recover our costs because: (1) the indexing methodology is tied to an inflation index; (2) it is not based on pipeline-specific costs; and (3) it could be reduced in comparison to the current formula. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow. FERC could limit our pipeline\u2019s ability to set rates based on its costs, order our pipelines to reduce rates, require the payment of refunds or reparations to shippers, or any or all of these actions, which could adversely affect our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. If FERC\u2019s ratemaking methodology changes, the new methodology could also result in tariffs that generate lower revenues and cash flow.\nBased on the way our oil pipelines are operated, we believe that the only transportation on our pipelines that is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC is the transportation specified in the tariffs we have on file with FERC. We cannot guarantee that the jurisdictional status of transportation on our pipelines and related facilities will remain unchanged, however. Should circumstances change, then currently non-jurisdictional transportation could be found to be FERC-jurisdictional. In that case, FERC\u2019s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our actual costs, may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs, and may subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our tariff rates are successfully challenged, we could be required to reduce our tariff rates, which would reduce our revenues.\nShippers on our pipelines are free to challenge, or to cause other parties to challenge or assist others in challenging, our existing or proposed tariff rates. If any party successfully challenges our tariff rates, the effect would be to reduce revenues.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to such energy commodities, expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nFERC, the FTC and the CFTC hold statutory authority to regulate certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to these commodities, we are required to observe and comply with these anti-fraud and anti-manipulation regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nAt the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish certain permits and construction reviews designed to allow operations while ensuring the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of air quality by GHG emissions from large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant, or criteria, pollutant emissions. To the extent that we become subject to these permitting requirements, we could be required to install \u201cbest available control technology\u201d to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs as well as criteria pollutants from such sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities. Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations; in June 2016, the EPA published new source performance standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two-year stay of certain requirements of this rule pending reconsideration. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France in an agreement that requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). Although the Paris Agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. The United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations\nThe adoption of financial reform legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us that participate in that market. This legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010 and requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require certain counterparties with whom we may enter into derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the original counterparty. The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure any future derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our future use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, NGLs and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nCyber incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The complexity of the technologies needed to extract oil and natural gas in increasingly difficult physical environments and global competition for oil and natural gas resources make certain information attractive to thieves.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. Certain countries, including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies. SCADA-based systems are potentially more vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the increased number of connections with office networks and the internet.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources;\n\u00b7\ndata corruption, communication interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a drilling incident or a dry hole;\n\u00b7\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt one of our major development projects, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices and reduced revenues;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u00b7\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions\nwere largely unchanged in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. It is unclear whether any of the foregoing or similar proposals will be considered and enacted as part of future tax reform legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development and any such change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent changes in U.S. federal income tax law may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Among other items, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and provided for a new limitation on the deduction for interest expense. Given the scope of this law and the potential interdependency of its changes, it is difficult at this time to assess whether the overall effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes may adversely impact our financial results.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, those that:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nCircumstances may arise in which our significant stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nThe warrants issued by the Company in accordance with the Plan may be exercised for shares of common stock of the Company, which could have a dilutive effect to stockholders of the Company.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Plan, on the Emergence Date, we issued warrants initially exercisable for one share of common stock of the Company per warrant at an initial exercise price of $43.66. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part. The exercise of these warrants into common stock of the Company could have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our stockholders of the Company.\nThere is no assurance that the market price of our common stock will ever exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and as a result, the warrants may expire worthless. Further, the terms of such warrants may be amended in a manner adverse to warrant holders.\nThe market price of our common stock is extremely speculative and volatile. There is no assurance that the market price of our common stock will exceed the warrant exercise price, currently $43.66 per share, under the warrants issued by the Company on the Emergence Date in accordance with the Plan before December 30, 2021, the expiration date of the warrants, and they may expire worthless. In addition, the Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants originally issued to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment.", "PERMNO": 16587, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGC"}
