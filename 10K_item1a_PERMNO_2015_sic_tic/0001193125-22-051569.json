The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of the value of any of our shares held by you.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited operating history, we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if profitability is achieved, we may be unable to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical trial and development programs for resmetirom and other future product candidates. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $667.3 million. Losses have principally resulted from costs incurred in our preclinical and clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $270.3 million. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance and, if resmetirom or other future product candidates are approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in us incurring further significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently generate no revenue from product sales, and we may never be able to commercialize resmetirom or other future product candidates. We do not currently have the required approvals to market resmetirom or any other future product candidates, and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any of our future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nOur business depends on the success of resmetirom, which is still in clinical development and has not completed a pivotal trial. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize resmetirom, or we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe primary focus of our product development since mid- 2018 has been resmetirom, a liver-directed selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for potential use in non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis, or NASH. Successful continued development and ultimate regulatory approval of resmetirom for NASH is critical to the future success of our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the clinical development of resmetirom. We will need to raise sufficient funds to successfully complete our clinical development program for resmetirom in NASH. The future regulatory and commercial success of resmetirom is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete the necessary clinical trials for resmetirom, including, but not limited to, our planned registrational clinical trials to obtain drug approval;\n\u2022\nthe mechanism of action of resmetirom is complex and we do not know the degree to which it will translate into a therapeutic benefit, if any, in NASH or any other indication, and we do not know the degree to which the complex mechanism of action may contribute to long term safety issues or adverse events, if any, when resmetirom is taken for prolonged periods such as in the treatment of NASH or any other indication;\n\u2022\ndelay or inability to reach agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities on acceptable clinical trial design;\n\u2022\nregulators, IRBs or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate evidence from clinical trials of efficacy and safety for resmetirom in NASH or any other indication;\n\u2022\nwe do not know the degree to which resmetirom will be accepted as a therapy by physicians, patients and payors, even if approved;\n\u2022\nin our clinical programs for resmetirom, we may experience variability in patients, adjustments to clinical trial procedures and the need for additional clinical trial sites, which could delay our clinical trial progress;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies for marketing approval;\n\u2022\npatients in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to resmetirom, which could delay or prevent further clinical development;\n\u2022\nthe standards implemented by clinical or regulatory agencies may change at any time;\n\u2022\nwe cannot be certain what efficacy endpoints clinical or regulatory agencies may require in a Phase 3 clinical trial of NASH or for approval of our product candidates; we also cannot be certain if we will be able to gain Subpart H approval of any of our product candidates based on surrogate endpoints;\n\u2022\nforeign clinical or regulatory agencies may require efficacy and safety endpoints for Phase 3 clinical trials that may not be favorable to us and different from the results we have observed to date in our current trials;\n\u2022\nother differences in the design of our ongoing and planned Phase 3 clinical trials of the treatment of NASH, including the use of a new tablet formulation of resmetirom and/or the inclusion of patients with more advanced NASH, could cause the results of our Phase 3 trials to be less favorable than the results we observed in our Phase 2 trials in NASH;\n\u2022\nif we obtain Subpart H approval of resmetirom based on a surrogate endpoint, consistent with our ongoing Phase 3 trial, we will be required to conduct a post-approval clinical outcomes trial to confirm the clinical benefit of the product candidate and if the post-approval trial is not successful we may not be able to continue marketing the product;\n\u2022\nwe cannot be certain of the number and type of clinical trials and non-clinical\nstudies that FDA or other regulatory agencies will require in order to approve resmetirom for NASH;\n\u2022\nif approved for NASH, resmetirom will likely compete with the off-label\nuse of currently marketed products and other therapies in development that may reach approval for NASH prior to resmetirom; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is placed on clinical hold, suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or the FDA, the competent authorities and/or ethics committees of the EU Member States or other regulatory authorities, if a clinical trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial, or on account of changes to federal, state, or local laws. A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, EMA, competent authorities and/or ethics committees of the EU Member States or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold,\nunforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment, failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nMany of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our business and results of operations. Any delays in our clinical development programs may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations significantly.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in the pharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage results in the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market resmetirom, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses or patient populations for which we may market the products. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize resmetirom. If we or any of our future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize resmetirom, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement and involve uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate that we advance into clinical trials, including resmetirom, may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has inherent risk. We will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in our target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for its commercial sale. Clinical studies are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. Delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, because later-stage clinical trials may be conducted in broader patient populations and involve different study designs. For instance, our Phase 1 results and our Phase 2 primary endpoint results in NASH may not be predictive of any future results in any Phase 3 clinical trial in NASH. Furthermore, our ongoing and future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in large patient populations for approval by regulatory authorities. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our ongoing or future clinical trials will be successful, and any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications.\nBecause resmetirom has not yet received regulatory approval for any indication, it is difficult to predict the time and cost of development and our ability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization.\nResmetirom has neither received Subpart H or full regulatory approval for the treatment of NASH or any other indication, and unexpected problems may arise that could cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our development efforts in any or all indications. Further, the long-term safety consequences of a liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist are not known. Regulatory approval of new product candidates such as resmetirom can be more expensive and take longer than approval for candidates for the treatment of more well-understood diseases with previously approved products.\nIf clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay, suspend, or terminate those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including but are not limited to any of the following, could delay or impede completely the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or other regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct and complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslow enrollment and retention rate of subjects in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchallenges in identifying or recruiting sufficient study sites or investigators for clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects related to the product candidate being tested.\nCommercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any other applicable foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA or such foreign regulatory authority.\nWe do not know whether our ongoing clinical trials will need to be restructured, will enroll an adequate number of patients on time, or will be completed on schedule, if at all, or whether future clinical trials will begin as planned or have similar future challenges. Delays in the initiation, enrollment or completion of our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited.\nIf we inadvertently fail to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs, we could be prevented from selling our drug candidates in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement for marketing our drug candidates outside the United States vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing. We expect that our future clinical development of our drug candidates will involve a number of clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions, particularly in Europe. We have no experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals. The time required to obtain approvals outside the United States may differ from that\nrequired to obtain FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not guarantee approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our drug candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on enrollment of patients in our clinical trials for our product candidates. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, including those arising out of COVID-19,\nour clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. We may not be able to initiate, continue, or complete clinical trials required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies for resmetirom if we are unable to locate, enroll and maintain a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate. Our Phase 3 clinical trials have significantly more patients than were enrolled in our Phase 2 trials. Although we have satisfied Subpart H patient enrollment for MAESTRO-NASH, clinical enrollment is not complete as of December 31, 2021 and significant additional enrollment will be necessary and will be ongoing for some time. A significant factor in the timing to conduct and complete clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and disadvantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. For instance, we are aware that other companies conducting clinical trials in NASH patients have had delays in recruiting patients for their trials. In the MAESTRO-NASH Phase 3 trial, patients\u2019 willingness to undergo a liver biopsy involve risk factors. In addition, potential patients for resmetirom may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases which we are targeting or may not meet the entry criteria for our studies.\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has presented significant challenges in the enrollment and conduct of MAESTRO-NASH. Screening for MAESTRO-NASH was negatively impacted due to the outbreak of the COVID-19\npandemic, and the resulting governmental quarantine restrictions and shelter-in-place\nguidelines that influenced the closing or suspension of many European and U.S. trial sites and a decline in U.S. patients seeking screening biopsies. In addition, because MAESTRO-NASH is focused on specific patient populations with protocol-specified biopsy requirements, our ability to enroll eligible patients was limited and enrollment was slower than we anticipated before the pandemic. While we believe our COVID-19\nmitigation efforts have positioned us to overcome past enrollment challenges, the pace of new enrollment cannot be guaranteed and ultimately will be dependent on our target study patients becoming comfortable initiating protocol-prescribed procedures, including biopsies, during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nIf the COVID-19\npandemic continues or worsens, our patient recruitment and enrollment efforts may be adversely affected, delayed or interrupted. In addition, patients may choose to withdraw from our studies or we may choose to (or be required) to pause enrollment and or patient dosing in our trial in order to preserve health resources and protect trial participants, as applicable. It is unknown whether or how long pauses, delays or disruptions could occur or continue. Our ability to successfully complete enrollment and study objectives in the midst of the COVID-19\npandemic is subject to circumstances beyond our control and also is subject to the enhanced risks and uncertainties that are described in our other Risk Factors.\nIn addition, he FDA typically requires sponsors of lipid-lowering product candidates to conduct drug-drug interaction studies with statins because statins may have increased safety risks when administered together with other drug therapies that affect their pharmacokinetic profile. We have completed two Phase 1 clinical drug interaction studies of resmetirom and statins in 39 normal healthy volunteers, which showed resmetirom to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH including\npatients taking low dose statins. We have also completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in HeFH including patients taking high dose statins. In general, drug interactions between resmetirom and statins and any other drug that might result in adverse events could delay development in later clinical trials.\nWe will be required to identify and enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials. We also may encounter difficulties in identifying and enrolling NASH patients with a stage of disease appropriate for our future clinical trials. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate and maintain a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required (or as may be required) by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, the process of finding and diagnosing patients is costly and may prove more costly in the future. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our clinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials.\nAny product candidate in our current or future clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or side effects or have other properties that may delay or prevent its regulatory approval or commercialization or limit its commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates in current or future clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development of or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product candidate.\nOccurrence of serious treatment-related side effects could impede subject recruitment and clinical trial enrollment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial, require us to halt the clinical trial, and prevent receipt of regulatory approval from the FDA. They could also adversely affect physician or patient acceptance of our product candidates or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nWe have received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for resmetirom for NASH; however, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and the designation may be rescinded if the product candidate no longer meets the qualifying criteria for Fast Track.\nIn October 2019, FDA granted Fast Track designation to resmetirom for NASH. Products that have been designated as Fast Track may be eligible for certain action to expedite development and review of the application, including rolling review. The receipt of Fast Track designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nOur product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP regulations, and GCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, all of which\nmay result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to periodic review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA or other marketing application and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. In addition, any regulatory approvals that we receive for resmetirom may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, and will contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS Program as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.\nIf we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, or previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u2022\nholds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures or detentions;\n\u2022\npressure to initiate voluntary product recalls;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.\nIf any of these events occurs, our ability to sell such products may be impaired, and we may incur substantial additional expense to comply with regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry, and our product candidates may become obsolete.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly evolving field. Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase. Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us. Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these competitive products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the desired therapeutic effect than products being developed by us. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete. In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we may, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our or any of our partners\u2019 product candidates, the sales of our product candidates would be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA or marketing authorization application outside the United States is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d that can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application in the United States. Agency regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing\nversions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an abbreviated new drug application or other application for generic substitutes in the United States and in nearly every pharmaceutical market around the world. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use, or labeling, as our product and that the generic product is bioequivalent to our product, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than our product to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our product or any of our partners\u2019 future products, if any, would materially adversely affect our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made and expect to make in our or any of our partners\u2019 product candidates, including resmetirom.\nCompetition that our or any of our partners\u2019 products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept our future products or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue or any profits from operations. Physicians may decide not to recommend its treatments for a variety of reasons including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nlimited or no coverage by third-party payers;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the label of the drug;\n\u2022\nother potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n\u2022\nineffective marketing and distribution support of its products.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance or such market is smaller than anticipated, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.\nThe continuation or worsening of the COVID-19\npandemic, could affect our ability to complete our ongoing clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities and delay or disrupt commercialization of resmetirom, and may have other adverse effects on our stock price and business operations.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has caused, and may continue to cause many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak of the virus and its multiple variations. These measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, heightened border security, shelter-in\nplace guidelines, social distancing restrictions and other measures. This outbreak and the resulting governmental measures have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce in the life sciences industry generally, as supply chains and manufacturing process have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; available personnel has declined; and demand for certain third-party goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are extremely uncertain and subject to the risks described below.\nWe and our contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMO\u201d) may face disruptions that have affected and may continue to affect our ability to conduct and timely complete ongoing clinical trials including disruptions in procuring items that are essential for our development activities, such as materials and intermediates used in the manufacturing of resmetirom. We and our CROs and CMOs, as well as clinical trial sites, have faced and may continue to face disruptions related to our ongoing clinical trials arising from staffing disruptions and limitations on our activities and the activities of our CROs and CMOs, and delays in the ability to obtain necessary institutional review board or other necessary site approvals or delays in site initiations or site monitoring visits, as well as other delays at clinical trial sites. We may also face limitations on enrollment and patients withdrawing from our clinical trials or not complying with the protocol procedures, which could delay completion of our clinical trials or adversely affect the data generated by our clinical trials. For instance, patient screening and enrollment has been impacted and study patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols (including biopsy testing), in each case where quarantines or shelter-in-place\nrestrictions impede patient movement or interrupt patient demand for, or a medical facility\u2019s delivery of, protocol-required services and procedures. Additionally, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who may have heightened risks if exposed to COVID-19\nmay adversely impact the Company\u2019s clinical trial operations. The response to the COVID-19\npandemic also could redirect resources with respect to regulatory and intellectual property matters in a way that could adversely impact our ability to progress regulatory approvals and protect our intellectual property. In addition, we may face impediments to regulatory meetings and approvals due to measures that are intended to limit in-person\ninteractions. The pandemic has significantly impacted economies worldwide, which could result in adverse effects on our business and operations. Moreover, the pandemic has also caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which has led to increased trading volatility and significant stock price declines, particularly in the first quarter of 2020, and the pandemic or related consequences may adversely impact the future volatility and value of our stock and future trading in our stock.\nIn accordance with governmental pronouncements, we have instituted policies to facilitate working remotely. The continuation of personnel working from home (not only at Madrigal, but also at CROs, CMOs, clinical sites and governmental and supervisory bodies) has negatively impacted our productivity and our business plans. Past and future disruptions adversely impacted and could impact our business operations and/or delay necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors, including our CROs and CMOs. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19\npandemic will be on our business. However, it has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAs we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, and marketing and sales capabilities and may need to further contract with third\nparties to provide these capabilities. As our operations expand, we likely will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.\nMaintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to effectively manage our development efforts, recruit and train sales and marketing personnel, effectively manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop without the involvement of these third parties. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nThe uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, (the ACA) became law in the United States. The goal of the ACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, any products we develop that receives regulatory approval. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential additional changes are uncertain at this time. We expect that the ACA, its implementation, efforts to\nrepeal or replace, or invalidate the ACA, or portions thereof, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of existing products or to successfully commercialize product candidates, if approved.\nIf any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our collaborative partners, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates in seriously ill patients and will face an even greater risk if product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities and introduced commercially. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling any of our future approved products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any of our future approved products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or a change in the indications for which products may be used;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we will be highly dependent upon consumer perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Also, because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from patients\u2019 use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe do not currently hold product liability insurance coverage. Prior to commercialization of our product candidates, we will need to purchase insurance coverage. As a result, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product development and commercialization efforts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash resources and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees, contractors, vendors and partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, contractors, vendors or partners. Misconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data timely, completely or accurately, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us resulting from this misconduct and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we have to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from our or our potential sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreements. With respect to our commercial agreements, we indemnify our vendors from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right by a third party.\nShould our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we are denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAlthough the development and commercialization of resmetirom is our primary focus, as part of our longer-term growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and commercialization of other therapies related to thyroid hormone, orphan and other diseases. We will evaluate internal opportunities from our compound libraries, and also may choose to in-license\nor acquire other product candidates as well as commercial products to treat patients suffering from thyroid hormone, orphan or other disorders with high unmet medical needs and limited treatment options. These other product candidates may require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval by the FDA and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, be successfully commercialized, be widely accepted in the marketplace, or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products will be impaired.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Paul A. Friedman, M.D., and our President, Research and Development, and Chief Medical Officer, Rebecca Taub, M.D. These executives each have significant pharmaceutical industry experience. The loss of any member of our management team or scientific staff, including Drs. Friedman and Taub, would impair our ability to identify, develop and market new products. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources. In addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our development and commercialization programs.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not receive adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals.\nWe currently do not have significant marketing, sales or distribution infrastructure with respect to our product candidates. If we are unable to fully develop our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or through collaborations with marketing partners, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe currently do not have significant marketing, sales or distribution capabilities and have limited sales or marketing experience within our organization. If our lead product candidate, resmetirom, is approved, we intend to establish a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize resmetirom in the United States, and to license or outsource this function to a third party or third parties outside of the United States. Either of these options would be expensive and time-consuming. Some or all of these costs may be incurred in advance of any approval of resmetirom. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force in the United States that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely affect the commercialization of resmetirom and other future product candidates.\nWith respect to our existing and future product candidates, we may choose to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or as an alternative to our own sales force and distribution systems. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion\nor other licensing arrangements, our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold any approved products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of these third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any approved products. If we are not successful in commercializing any approved products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of resmetirom or any other future product candidate, we may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding clinical trial design, safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and\nregulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar foreign legislation by extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product may not extend beyond the current patent expiration dates and competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue could be potentially materially reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nWe may fail to obtain orphan drug designations from the FDA for our product candidates, as applicable, and even if we obtain such designations, we may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity.\nOur strategy includes filing for orphan drug designation where available for our product candidates. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee\nwaivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nWe have not obtained orphan designation for any product candidates to date, although we believe some of the potential indications of our product candidates could qualify for orphan drug designation and the related benefits if approved for such indications and we may file for orphan drug designation with respect to such indications. Even if we obtain such designations, we may not be the first to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing\npharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the orphan-designated disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug designation exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition, and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity. Even after an orphan-designated product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek orphan drug designation for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations. Failure to obtain an orphan drug designation for our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our partners market products in a manner that violates fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, or if we or our partners violate government price reporting laws, we or our partners may be subject to administrative civil and/or criminal penalties.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, if we obtain FDA approval for our product candidates, and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and third-party payors, subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws include, among others, the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws. At such time, if ever, as we or any of our partners market any of our future approved products, it is possible that some of our business activities and/or our partners could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nFederal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among others, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowing and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. There are other federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws and regulations, as well as laws that require reporting of payments to certain health care professionals and adoption of certain compliance program requirements, that will govern our operations if and when we begin commercializing our products.\nIn addition, we and/or our partners may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information.\nMost states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which may apply to items such as pharmaceutical products and services reimbursed by private insurers. We and/or our partners may be subject to administrative, civil and criminal sanctions for violations of any of these federal and state laws. Pharmaceutical\nand other healthcare companies have been sued or found to have violated these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing and other activities, such as: providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label\npromotion; and knowingly submitting false pricing information to the federal government, knowingly misrepresenting that information, or failing to timely submit that information. Pharmaceutical companies may further be found liable for civil monetary penalties for knowing and intentionally overcharging covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including (depending on the applicable law) criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing\nproduct approvals, private \u2018\u2018qui tam\u2019\u2019 actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe use third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with FDA requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.\nThe FDA requires us and our third-party service providers to comply with GCP for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory or GCP requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. In addition, third parties may not be able to repeat their past successes in clinical trials. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.\nIf our relationship with these third-party providers terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative providers or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third-party providers involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus, and could delay development and commercialization of our product candidates. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our third-party providers, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so. As a result, we currently rely, and\nexpect to rely on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves. For example, if we do not maintain our key manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products following approval.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current or future third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks on information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and they are being conducted by increasingly sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. In addition to extracting sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service\nattacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. The prevalent use of mobile devices also increases the risk of data security incidents. While we have not experienced any material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and significant reputational, financial, legal, regulatory, business or operational harm. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants to comply with our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations to third parties, or any data security incidents or other security breaches that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation or public statements against us, could cause third parties to lose\ntrust in us or could result in claims by third parties asserting that we have breached our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, data security incidents and other security breaches can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm. While we have implemented data security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or data security incidents.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their \u201cbusiness associates\u201d - certain persons or covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity. We could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nTo the extent we collect California resident personal information, we may also be subject to the CCPA. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, created new transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard to their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (\u201cCPPA\u201d). The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and damages. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations or limitations in the area of consumer protection. These laws and regulations are evolving and may impose limitations on our business activities. The obligations to comply with new privacy laws may require us, among other things, to update our notices and develop new processes internally and with our third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants to facilitate consumer rights requests, and such laws may impose restrictions on our processing of personal information that may impact the way we operate our business. We may be subject to fines, penalties, or private actions in the event of non-compliance\nwith such laws. The CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\nEuropean data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information.\nOutside the United States, our clinical trial programs and operations implicate international data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d). The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to the processing of personal data of individuals located in the EU. The GDPR, together with the national legislation of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data and samples from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the sharing of personal data with third parties, the transfer of personal data out of the EU,\nsecurity breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for violations of the data protection obligations. Specifically regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, while there are legal mechanisms available to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU, including to the United States, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding such data transfers, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal data or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to come into compliance with applicable data transfer impact assessments and implementation of legal data transfer mechanisms. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-US\nPrivacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism and confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and in June 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states, as well as in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, have promulgated national privacy laws that impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing and transferring EU personal data, with the United Kingdom and Switzerland following the EU with the publication of new Model Clauses to be incorporated in all applicable contracts within a specified timeframe in order to legitimize data transfers from those jurisdictions. Our ability to continue to transfer personal data outside of the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland may become significantly more expensive and may subject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or similar local laws, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates are subject in part to the terms and conditions of a license to resmetirom granted to us by Roche.\nWe entered into a Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Hoffmann-La\nRoche, or Roche, on December 18, 2008. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, we assumed control of all development and commercialization of resmetirom and hold exclusive worldwide rights for all potential indications. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche exclusively licensed certain patent rights and know-how\nrelating to resmetirom in exchange for consideration consisting of an upfront payment, milestone payments tied to the achievement of product development and regulatory milestones, and royalty payments based on net sales of products containing resmetirom or another licensed product, subject to certain reductions. The Roche Agreement will expire, unless earlier terminated pursuant to other provisions thereof, on the last to occur of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering the manufacture, use or sale of products containing resmetirom, or (ii) ten years after the first sale of a product containing resmetirom. Under the Roche Agreement, Roche controls prosecution of the licensed patent rights, although we have a right to comment.\nWe do not have, nor have we had, any material disputes with Roche regarding the Roche Agreement. However, if there is any future dispute between us and Roche regarding the parties\u2019 rights under the Roche Agreement, our ability to develop and commercialize resmetirom, or any other product candidate covered by the Roche Agreement, may be materially harmed. Any uncured, material breach under the Roche Agreement could result in our loss of exclusive rights to resmetirom and may lead to a complete termination of the Roche Agreement and force us to cease product development efforts for resmetirom.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under agreements pursuant to which we license rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe may enter into license agreements from time to time. Licensing of intellectual property is important to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how\nresulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors and collaborators; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed or acquired from third parties prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe can provide no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technologies, nor can we provide any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While we have licensed rights to issued patents in the United States and other jurisdictions for resmetirom, we cannot be certain that the claims in issued patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. We cannot be certain that the claims in owned and licensed patent applications covering our product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and valid by courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign jurisdictions. Even if we owned and licensed patent applications covering our product candidates, the patents may not be enforced against competitors. For example, a formulation patent may not be enforced against those making and marketing a product that has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient in a different formulation that is not claimed in the formulation patent. Method-of-use\npatents protect the use of a product for the specified method or for treatment of a particular indication. This type of patent may not be enforced against competitors making and marketing a product that has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient but is used for a method not claimed in the patent. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d\nAlthough off-label\nprescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use\npatents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nOur composition-of-matter\npatent licensed from Roche relating to resmetirom is scheduled to expire in the United States in 2026. Our co-owned\npatents and pending patent applications that cover our particular solid form, dosage, method of manufacturing, and uses of resmetirom to treat various indications are scheduled to expire in 2033. Our exclusively-owned pending patent applications that cover companion diagnostics, various solid forms of resmetirom, combination therapy, method of use, and method of manufacturing, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2042. Our exclusively-owned pending patent application that covers other THR beta analogs and uses thereof, if issued, is expected to expire in 2043. While patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates for each of these patents, there can be no assurances that we will\nreceive any patent adjustments or patent term extensions. The patent application process and patent maintenance and enforcement are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u2022\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u2022\npatents may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nwe and our licensor(s) may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe and our licensor(s) may not have been the first to file patent applications for our product candidates or the compositions developed, or for their uses;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop identical, similar or alternative products or compositions and uses thereof;\n\u2022\nwe and our licensor(s)\u2019 disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u2022\nothers may design around our owned and licensed patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of the patents;\n\u2022\nothers may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our or our licensor(s)\u2019 patents;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where us and our licensor(s) do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nthere may be significant pressure on the United States government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u2022\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how.\nAlthough we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how,\nincluding entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that any of these parties would not breach the agreements to disclose any proprietary information, including trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Further, third parties may still obtain this information by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, third parties may come upon this or similar information lawfully and independently. We would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to\ncompete with us. Further, intellectual property rights have limitations and do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive position. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how,\nour business may be harmed.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, and a patent may become subject to post-grant proceedings including opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes\nreview or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nThe biotechnology industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of resmetirom or our other product candidates. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently-pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could likely:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\ncause development delays;\n\u2022\nprevent us from commercializing resmetirom for NASH or our other product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u2022\nrequire us to develop non-infringing\ntechnology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the filing date of this report, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent resmetirom or our other product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidate or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market resmetirom or our other product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that\nwe could redesign our product candidate or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing resmetirom or our other product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or in addition to interference proceedings, may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes\nreview, post-grant review or other post-grant proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we or any of our future development partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at one of our product candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement\nor insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own or co-own,\nto develop our product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license,\nor use these proprietary rights. For example, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and the rights to these formulations may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license\nany compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nWe may collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions and industry collaborators to accelerate our preclinical or clinical research. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of that program and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to research and develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Any of these could impair our competitive position.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties,\nindependent development or publication of information by any of our third party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWhile we have licensed from Roche issued patents directed at resmetirom in the United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on resmetirom in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing their inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with resmetirom, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund all of our planned operations, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize resmetirom and other future product candidates.\nAlthough we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next 12 months, we will require additional working capital in the next twelve-\nmonths and on a long-term basis in order to complete the remaining clinical development primarily for resmetirom and potentially for other product candidates through potential regulatory approval and through potential commercialization of these product candidates. We expect our spending levels overall to increase in connection with our clinical trials of resmetirom as well as other corporate activities. The amount and timing of any expenditure needed to implement our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe type, number, scope, progress, expansion costs, results of and timing of our future clinical trials and projected product label or the need for additional clinical trials of resmetirom for NASH and dyslipidemia or any of our other product candidates which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approval for resmetirom for NASH and any of our other potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of obtaining or maintaining manufacturing for resmetirom for NASH and any of our other product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and reimbursement capabilities and enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, license agreements and other partnerships, including for ex-US resmetirom opportunities;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with any new product candidates that we may develop, in-license\nor acquire; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. Our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of all planned clinical trials and commercialization objectives for our product candidates. These and other circumstances may cause to delay certain research activities and related clinical expenses, but such delays will not alter our need to raise additional funding. As a result, we will need to raise substantial additional funds in the future.\nWe have not sold any products, and we do not expect to sell or derive revenue from any product sales for the foreseeable future. We may seek additional funding through future debt and equity financings, as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies or through non-dilutive\nfinancings. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders or have a potential restrictive effect on how we operate our business. In addition, market perception that we need to issue additional shares, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may need to delay certain aspects of, or be unable to complete, planned clinical trials for resmetirom for NASH and our other product candidates, and we may be required to significantly curtail some or all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in\nlosses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nOur net operating losses have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if\na corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change\ntax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, or similar state provisions, has previously occurred. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and may be substantial.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The closing price of our common stock has ranged from $55.89 to $137.5 per share during the period from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including: global market or financial developments (whether due to the COVID pandemic or otherwise); US market events (including the potential for unusual market trading activity following external short interest developments or social media activity, such as those that have impacted certain stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and GameStop Corp. in 2021, and which in any case generally would be beyond our control); the outbreak of war or hostilities; NASH therapeutic company developments and/or FDA developments, regardless of whether occurring generally and/or specifically as to our clinical trials and development programs; industry-wide events; and the following events or developments:\n\u2022\nthe losses we may incur, including increased losses resulting from costs associated with increases in our clinical trial activity;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\npublic or regulatory concern as to the safety and efficacy of NASH products developed by us or others or public safety generally; and\n\u2022\nlitigation.\nIn addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In the event any of the foregoing occur, the market price of our common stock could be highly volatile and may materially decline.\nA small number of our stockholders own a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock and may be deemed to have substantial control over us; therefore, your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited.\nCertain stockholders affiliated and associated with our officers and directors collectively own approximately 19.25% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021 and acting together, may have the ability to substantially affect matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a strategic transaction, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions include a classified board of directors. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. In June 2021 we established a new \u201cat-the-market\u201d\n(\u201cATM\u201d) program in the amount of $200 million. As of December 31, 2021, $159.2 million remained reserved and available for sale under this ATM program. We may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock under this ATM program to or through a sales agent up to established limits. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, through the ATM program or otherwise, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. Please see Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor more details regarding potential sales of our common stock under the ATM program.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted from a beneficial ownership standpoint and value may be diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or significant short sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were a number of investors or investor groups that held a significant beneficial ownership interest in our common stock, including: 2,037,140 shares of our outstanding common stock (the \u201cBay City Affiliate Holdings\u201d) beneficially owned by Dr. Fred Craves, our Lead Director, which includes 1,511,782 shares beneficially owned by Bay City Capital LLC (\u201cBay City\u201d); 1,251,619 shares of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned by Drs. Paul Friedman and Becky Taub (the \u201cFriedman/Taub Holdings\u201d), our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President of R&D and Chief Medical Officer, respectively; 1,969,797 shares of outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock, a common stock equivalent with no voting rights, that is convertible into shares of Common Stock on a 1-for-1\nbasis only to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion the holders thereof and their affiliates and any persons who are members of a Section 13(d) group with the holders or their affiliates would beneficially own (in the aggregate, for purposes of Rule 13d-3\nunder the Exchange Act) no more than 4.99% of the outstanding Common Stock (the \u201cBeneficial Ownership\nLimitation\u201d); and 2,301,574 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options under our 2015 Stock Plan, as amended (the \u201cCommon Shares Underlying Our Stock Options\u201d). The Bay City Affiliate Holdings and the Friedman/Taub Holdings collectively represent approximately 19.22% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021, and are capable of being sold directly (including by Bay City or its affiliated funds) or indirectly (following any future distribution to Bay City from affiliated funds, to Bay City fund limited partners, or by Bay City to its partners), and any material sale of such shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital. As of December 31, 2021, the 1,969,797 Common Shares Underlying Our Preferred Stock (disregarding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation and assuming the full conversion of all currently outstanding preferred shares) owned by entities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP and 1,499,213 additional shares of common stock directly owned by entities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP collectively represented beneficial ownership of approximately 19.9% of our common stock on an as converted basis (the \u201cBaker Bros. Fully Converted Interest\u201d). In addition, we have six institutional investors who have filed Schedule 13Gs (or amendments thereto) reflecting collective beneficial ownership, as of December 31, 2021, of approximately 34.8% of our outstanding common stock (\u201cOur Other Shares Beneficially Owned by Institutional Investors\u201d). Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by one or more of the investors of groups listed above (such as the Common Shares Underlying Our Stock Options, the Bay City Affiliate Holdings, the Friedman/Taub Holdings, the Baker Bros. Fully Converted Interest, the Common Shares Underlying Our Stock Options, or Our Other Shares Beneficially Owned by Institutional Investors) or other equity-related securities in the public markets, could depress the market price of our common stock. If there are significant sales or short sales of our stock, the price decline that could result from this activity may cause the share price to decline further, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the common stock to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of common stock in the market. See \u201cRisk Factors; Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock -\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\n\u201d\nSuch sales or short sales also may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, if at all.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future. As a result, the only return to stockholders will be appreciation in the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91832, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MDGL"}
