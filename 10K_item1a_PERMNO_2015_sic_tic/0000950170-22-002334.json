RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities:\n\u2022Our business is highly regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The lending and financing industry continues to be targeted by new laws or regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the lending and financing products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations.\n\u2022The CFPB has examination authority over our U.S. consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business.\n\u2022We are subject to a Consent Order issued by the CFPB, and any noncompliance could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Significant changes in international laws or regulations or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of Brazil, or any other country in which we begin operations, could affect our operations in these countries.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our operations and financial results. The ultimate extent of the impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and prospects is uncertain.\n\u2022Our access to payment processing systems to disburse and collect loan and financing proceeds and repayments, including the Automated Clearing House, is critical to our business, and any interruption or limitation on our ability to utilize any of the available means of processing deposits or payments could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The failure to comply with debt collection regulations could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business.\n\u2022We use lead providers and marketing affiliates to assist us in obtaining new customers, and if lead providers or marketing affiliates do not comply with an increasing number of applicable laws and regulations, or if our ability to use such lead providers or marketing affiliates is otherwise impaired, it could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The use of personal data for credit underwriting is highly regulated.\n\u2022Negative public perception of our business could cause demand for our products to significantly decrease.\n\u2022Control of the Congress and the executive branch of the U.S. government could have a significant impact on financial services legislation passed in Congress and signed into law.\n\u2022Current and future litigation or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022Judicial decisions, CFPB rulemaking or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable.\n\u2022In some circumstances, federal preemption and application of an out-of-state choice of law provision will not, or may not, be available for the benefit of certain non-bank purchasers of loans to defend against a state law claim of usury.\n\u2022The failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to us to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt our operations or result in a loss of revenue.\n\u2022Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems, as well as the ability of such systems to support compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\u2022Decreased demand for our products and specialty financial services and our failure to adapt to such decrease could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022The determination of the fair values of the Company\u2019s loan and finance receivables portfolio involves unobservable inputs that can be highly subjective and may prove to be materially different than the actual economic outcome.\n\u2022We are subject to impairment risk.\n\u2022If the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer\u2019s qualification to receive a loan and our operating results may be harmed.\n\u2022We are subject to anticorruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions laws, and our failure to comply therewith, particularly as we continue to expand internationally, could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022Failure of operating controls could produce a significant negative outcome, including customer experience degradation, legal expenses, increased regulatory cost, significant internal and external fraud losses and vendor risk.\n\u2022Increased competition from banks, credit card companies, other consumer lenders, and other entities offering similar financial products and services could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022Our success is dependent, in part, upon our officers, and if we are not able to attract and retain qualified officers, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022A sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce demand for our products and services and result in reduced earnings.\n\u2022We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and analytics or keep up with that of our competitors.\n\u2022We may be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022We are subject to cyber security risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\n\u2022Our ability to collect payment on loans and maintain the accuracy of accounts may be adversely affected by computer viruses, electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions.\n\u2022If internet search engine providers change their methodologies for organic rankings or paid search results, or our organic rankings or paid search results decline for other reasons, our new customer growth or volume from returning customers could decline.\n\u2022Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure and could be costly.\n\u2022We may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of OnDeck, and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.\n\u2022Future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022The preparation of our financial statements and certain tax positions taken by us require the judgment of management, and we could be subject to risks associated with these judgments or could be adversely affected by the implementation of new, or changes in the interpretation of existing, accounting principles, financial reporting requirements or tax rules.\n\u2022Our U.S. consumer loan and small business financing businesses are seasonal in nature, which causes our revenue and earnings to fluctuate.\n\u2022We have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under anticipated agreements governing our indebtedness.\n\u2022The terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\n\u2022Changes in our financial condition or a potential disruption in the capital markets could reduce available capital.\n\u2022Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nRisk Factors\nOur business and future results may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties that should be considered carefully in evaluating us. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below. The occurrence of one or more of the events listed below could also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is highly regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products and services are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, local and international statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules and guidance. For example, our loan products may be subject to requirements that generally mandate licensing or authorization as a lender or as a credit services organization or credit access business (collectively, \u201cCSO\u201d), establish limits on the amount, duration, renewals or extensions of and charges for (including interest rates and fees) various categories of loans, direct the form and content of our loan contracts and other documentation, restrict collection practices, outline underwriting requirements and subject us to periodic examination and ongoing supervision by regulatory authorities, among other things. We must comply with federal laws, such as TILA, ECOA, FCRA, EFTA, GLBA and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, among others, as well as regulations adopted to implement those laws. In addition, our marketing and disclosure efforts and the representations made about our products and services are subject to unfair and deceptive practice statutes, including the FTC Act, the TCPA and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 in the United States and analogous state statutes under which the FTC, the CFPB, state attorneys general or private plaintiffs may bring legal actions.\nAdditionally, with the acquisition of OnDeck, changes in laws or regulations or changes to the application or interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to small business lenders could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate in the manner in which the Company currently conducts business or make it more difficult or costly for the Company to originate or otherwise acquire additional small business loans, or for the Company to collect payments on the small business loans. Such changes could subject the Company to additional licensing, registration and other legal or regulatory requirements in the future or otherwise that could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business.\nWe are also subject to various international laws, licensing or authorization requirements in connection with the products or services we offer in Brazil, Australia and Canada. Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance requires forms, processes, procedures, training, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may also create operational constraints, be costly or adversely affect operating results. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation\u201d of Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of the laws applicable to us.\nThe regulatory environment in which we conduct our business is extensive and complex. From time to time we become aware of instances where our products and services have not fully complied with requirements under applicable laws and regulations or applicable contracts. Determinations of compliance with applicable requirements or contracts, such as those discussed above, can be highly technical and subject to varying interpretations. When we become aware of such an instance, products or services that may not be in compliance with applicable laws, whether as a result of our compliance reviews, regulatory inquiry, customer complaint or otherwise, we generally conduct a review of the activity in question and determine how to address it, such as modifying the product, making customer refunds or providing additional disclosure. We also evaluate whether reports or other notices to regulators are required and provide notice to regulators whenever required. In some cases, we have decided and will decide to take corrective action even after applicable statutory or regulatory cure periods have expired, and in other cases we have notified regulators even where such notification may not have been required. Regulators or customers reviewing such incidents or remedial activities may interpret the laws, regulations and customer contracts differently than we have, or may choose to take regulatory action against us or bring private litigation against us notwithstanding the corrective measures we have taken. This may be the case even if we no longer offer the product or service in question.\nState, federal and international regulators, as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 bars, have subjected our industry to intense scrutiny in recent years. In addition, our contracts for certain products and services may be governed by the law applicable in a state other than the state in which the customer resides. If a court were to reject our choice of law and determine that a contract was governed by the laws of another state, the contract may be unenforceable. A judgment that the choice of law provisions in our loan agreements is unenforceable also could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, penalties, damage to our reputation, trigger repurchase obligations, negatively impact the terms of our future loans and harm our operating results. Likewise, a judgment that the choice of law provision in other commercial loan agreements is unenforceable could result in challenges to our choice of law provision and that could result in costly and time-consuming litigation.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance, or any finding that our past forms, practices, processes, procedures, controls or infrastructure were insufficient or not in compliance, could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary, criminal or other penalties (some of which could be significant in the case of knowing or reckless violations), result in the issuance of cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), require us to refund payments, interest or fees, result in a determination that certain financial products are not collectible, result in a suspension or revocation of licenses or authorization to transact business, result in a finding that we have engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, limit our access to services provided by third-party financial institutions or cause damage to our reputation, brands and valued customer relationships. We may also incur additional, substantial expenses to bring those products and services into compliance with the laws of various jurisdictions or stop offering certain products and services in certain jurisdictions.\nOur failure to comply with any regulations, rules or guidance applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe lending and financing industry continues to be targeted by new laws and regulations in many jurisdictions that could restrict the lending and financing products and services we offer, impose additional compliance costs on us, render our current operations unprofitable or even prohibit our current operations.\nGovernments at the national, state and local levels, as well as international governments, may seek to impose new laws, regulatory restrictions or licensing requirements that affect the products or services we offer, the terms on which we may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations we must fulfill in connection with our lending and financing business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or to expand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and may have a negative effect on our business, prospects, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows. In some cases, these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of our current business activities in certain jurisdictions or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue.\nIn recent years, consumer loans, and in particular the category commonly referred to as \u201cpayday loans,\u201d which includes certain of our short-term loan products, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny that has resulted in increasingly restrictive regulations and legislation that makes offering such loans in certain states in the United States or the international countries where we operate (as further described below) less profitable or unattractive. Laws or regulations in some states in the United States require that all borrowers of certain short-term loan products be reported to a centralized database and limit the number of loans a borrower may receive or have outstanding. Other laws prohibit us from providing some of our consumer loan products in the United States to active duty military personnel, active members of the National Guard or members on active reserve duty and their spouses and covered dependents.\nCertain consumer advocacy groups and federal and state legislators and regulators have advocated that laws and regulations should be tightened so as to severely limit, if not eliminate, the type of loan products and services we offer to consumers, and this has resulted in both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. federal government and state governmental bodies exhibiting an interest in debating legislation that could further regulate consumer and/or small business loan products and services such as those that we offer. The U.S. Congress, as well as other similar federal, state and local bodies and similar international governmental authorities, have debated, and may in the future adopt, legislation or regulations that could, among other things, place a cap (or decrease a current cap) on the interest or fees that we can charge or a cap on the effective annual percentage rate that limits the amount of interest or fees that may be charged, ban or limit loan renewals or extensions of short-term loans (where the customer agrees to pay the current finance charge on a loan for the right to make payment of the outstanding principal balance of such loan at a later date plus an additional finance charge), including the rates to be charged for loan renewals or extensions, require us to offer an extended payment plan, limit origination fees for loans, require changes to our underwriting or collections practices, require lenders to be bonded or to report consumer loan activity to databases designed to monitor or restrict consumer borrowing activity, impose \u201ccooling off\u201d periods between the time a loan is paid off and another loan is obtained or prohibit us from providing any of our consumer loan products in the United States to active duty members of the U.S. military, reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate families.\nFurthermore, legislative or regulatory actions may be influenced by negative perceptions of us and our industry, even if such negative perceptions are inaccurate, attributable to conduct by third parties not affiliated with us (such as other industry members), or attributable to matters not specific to our industry.\nWe cannot currently assess the likelihood of any future unfavorable federal, state, local or international legislation or regulations being proposed or enacted that could affect our products and services. We closely monitor proposed legislation in jurisdictions where we offer our loan products. Additional legislative or regulatory provisions could be enacted that could severely restrict, prohibit or eliminate our ability to offer a consumer or small business loan or financing product. In addition, under statutory authority, U.S. state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways or issue new administrative rules, even if not contained in state statutes, that could adversely affect the way we do business and may force us to terminate or modify our operations in particular states or affect our ability to obtain new licenses or renew the licenses we hold.\nAny of these or other legislative or regulatory actions that affect our lending and financing business at the national, state, international and local level could, if enacted or interpreted differently, have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination authority over our U.S. consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business.\nIn July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which regulates U.S. consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans offered by us. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of such providers.\nThe CFPB exercises supervisory review over and examines certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans such as us. The CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar lenders, and ask questions about their business practices, and the examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities; loan application and origination activities; payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers; collections, accounts in default, and consumer reporting activities as well as third-party relationships. As a result of these examinations, we could be required to change our products, services or practices, whether as a result\nof another party being examined or as a result of an examination of us, or we could be subject to monetary penalties, which could materially adversely affect us.\nThe CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. In addition to having the authority to obtain monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a Consent Order issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and any noncompliance could materially adversely affect our business.\nOn January 25, 2019, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which we agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions, to pay a civil money penalty of $3.2 million. The Consent Order relates to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB in 2014, including failure to provide loan extensions to 308 consumers and debiting approximately 5,500 consumers from the wrong bank account. We remain subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including a prohibition from engaging in certain conduct. Any noncompliance with the Consent Order or similar orders or agreements from other regulators could lead to further regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could prohibit or directly or indirectly impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe CFPB recently finalized a new rule that may affect the consumer lending industry, and this rule could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. consumer lending business.\nOn October 6, 2017, the CFPB issued a rule on payday and certain high-cost installment loans, also known as the \u201cSmall Dollar Rule,\u201d which would cover some of the loans we offer. The Small Dollar Rule initially required that lenders who make short-term loans and longer-term loans with balloon payments reasonably determine consumers\u2019 ability to repay the loans according to their terms before issuing the loans. The Small Dollar Rule also introduced new limitations on repayment processes for those lenders as well as lenders of other longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent that include an ACH authorization or similar payment provision. If a consumer has two consecutive failed payment attempts, the lender must obtain the consumer\u2019s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the consumer\u2019s bank account. For loans covered by the Small Dollar Rule, lenders must provide certain notices to consumers before attempting a first payment withdrawal or an unusual withdrawal and after two consecutive failed payment attempts. On July 7, 2020, the CFPB issued the final Small Dollar Rule, rescinding the ability to repay (\"ATR\") and related provisions, such as the establishment of registered information systems for checking ATR and reporting loan activity. The payment provisions of the Small Dollar Rule remain in place, but are stayed indefinitely by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which is hearing an appeal from the plaintiff on a constitutional challenge to the rule. On October 14, 2021, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Small Dollar Rule will not take effect until 286 days after the Fifth Circuit rules on the appeal. If the Small Dollar Rule does become effective in its current proposed form, we will need to make certain changes to our payment processes and customer notifications in our U.S. consumer lending business. If we are not able to execute these changes effectively because of unexpected complexities, costs or otherwise, we cannot guarantee that the Small Dollar Rule will not have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur advertising and marketing materials and disclosures have been and continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn the jurisdictions where we operate, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to regulation under various industry standards, consumer protection laws, and other applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with the lending industry as a whole, our advertising and marketing materials have come under increased scrutiny.\nGoing forward, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to advertise and market our business in a manner we consider effective. Any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSignificant changes in international laws or regulations or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of Brazil, or any other country in which we begin operations, could affect our operations in these countries.\nWe offer, arrange and/or service online consumer loans to customers in Brazil and commercial lending products to customers in Canada and Australia. New legislation or regulations could further restrict the loan products we offer.\nSignificant changes in international laws or regulations or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of Brazil, Canada or Australia could restrict our ability to sustain or expand our operations. Similarly, a significant change in laws, regulations or overall treatment (including an interpretation or application of such laws and regulations not anticipated when exploring or initiating business) or a deterioration of the political, regulatory or economic environment of any other country in which we may decide to do business, could also materially adversely affect our prospects and could restrict our ability to initiate a pilot program or develop a pilot program into full business operations.\nThe administration of our subsidiary, CashEuroNet, through which we conducted our U.K. business, could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position.\nEffective October 25, 2019, in accordance with the provisions of the U.K. Insolvency Act and pursuant to approval by the board of directors of CashEuroNet, insolvency practitioners from Grant Thornton UK LLP were appointed as administrators in respect of our subsidiary, CashEuroNet. Claims related to the management and financial support of CashEuroNet prior to the administration may be asserted, which could result in additional expense to us. We are currently providing certain administrative, technical and other services, and incur other exit costs and expenses related to CashEuroNet during its administration. While we do not believe there will be claims or costs beyond the initial anticipated charge of $74.5 million, we cannot provide complete assurance we will not experience significant additional claims or costs related to the administration of CashEuroNet and its prior business conducted in the U.K.\nWe have previously ceased business in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory restrictions and, if we are forced to exit key jurisdictions in the future due to regulatory restrictions, this could adversely affect our business as a whole.\nIn the past we have ceased business in, restricted our operations in, or chosen not to begin business in, certain jurisdictions due to regulatory restrictions which render our operations impermissible, unprofitable or impractical. In addition, because we are in some cases subject to state/provincial and local regulation in addition to federal/national regulation, we may restrict or discontinue business in certain jurisdictions within countries where we are otherwise active. For example, as of December 31, 2021, we did not offer or arrange consumer loans in 12 U.S. states because we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate in those jurisdictions due to specific statutory or regulatory restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings or caps on the fees that may be charged.\nThe adoption of state regulatory measures cannot be predicted, but we expect that other states may propose or enact similar restrictions impacting our consumer or small business loan or financing products in the future, which could affect our operations in such states. Legislation or regulations targeting or otherwise directly affecting our products and services have been introduced or adopted in a number of states over the last few years, and we regularly monitor proposed legislation or regulations that could affect our business. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Legal Proceedings-U.S. State Regulation.\u201d\nIf we are forced to exit key jurisdictions due to such concerns, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find suitably attractive additional business opportunities elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our operations and financial results. The ultimate extent of the impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and prospects is uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and will likely continue to, severely impact global economic conditions, resulting in substantial volatility in the global financial markets, increased unemployment, and operational challenges resulting from measures that governments and other authorities have imposed to control its spread, such as travel bans, business and school limitations and closures, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. As our customers are located in the United States, Brazil, Canada and Australia, we began to see the initial impacts of the pandemic and governmental response on our business toward the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nVarious governmental bodies have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs, and the Federal Reserve of the United States has reduced interest rates. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted March 27, 2020 to provide $2.2 trillion of economy-wide financial stimulus in the form of financial aid to individuals, business, nonprofits, states, and municipalities. In December 2020, the U.S. government enacted a $900 billion pandemic relief bill that included enhanced unemployment benefits, direct cash payments to individuals, additional funding under the Payment Protection Program, and funding for hospitals and vaccines, among other items. We believe that governmental stimulus has favorably impacted our customers, helping many to meet their loan obligations. However, it is uncertain whether these actions or future actions will continue to be successful in countering the economic disruptions and these actions could have a further negative impact on the economy in the long term. Many of our customers are experiencing layoffs, furloughs, and other changes in work and financial situations, which may negatively impact their ability to repay us. Higher delinquency or default rates would have an adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolio.\nWhile we have seen the initial impact of the pandemic to our operations, the extent of its impact is highly dependent on variables that are difficult to predict, such as the scope and duration of the pandemic, and the success rate of measures taken by the governments to control its spread and stabilize the economy. If the pandemic is prolonged or the actions of government are unsuccessful, the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen. We could experience further reduced demand and availability of our products, higher credit losses in our portfolio, impairments of other financial assets, and other negative impacts to our financial position. We could have issues meeting our financial performance covenants, which would require waiver/amendment or could result in default on our financing agreements. We are highly reliant on our employees for our continued operations, and to the extent our employee population is impacted by the pandemic, or the actions by governmental bodies taken in reaction to the pandemic, this could adversely affect our ability to service our customers and to offer our products. Our access to capital markets could be hampered and could lead to a higher cost of capital.\nOur access to payment processing systems to disburse and collect loan and financing proceeds and repayments, including the Automated Clearing House, is critical to our business, and any interruption or limitation on our ability to utilize any of the available means of processing deposits or payments could materially adversely affect our business.\nWhen making loans and providing financing in the United States, we use several means of depositing proceeds into and collecting repayments from our customers\u2019 bank accounts, including the use of ACH. Our business, including loans made through the CSO programs, depends on payment processing systems to collect amounts due by repayments from our customers\u2019 bank accounts when we have obtained authorization to do so from the customer. Our transactions are processed by banks, and if these banks cease to provide any of the available means of payment processing services, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative processing methods are not as effective or not available.\nPrevious heightened regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other regulators, in an action referred to as Operation Choke Point, caused banks and ACH payment processors to cease doing business with certain short-term consumer lenders who were operating legally, without regard to whether those lenders were complying with applicable laws, simply to avoid the risk of heightened scrutiny or even litigation.\nOur access to payment processing systems could be impaired as a result of actions by regulators to cut off the access to payment processing systems to payday lenders or by rule changes by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (\u201cNACHA\u201d), which oversees the ACH network. The limited number of financial institutions we depend on may choose to discontinue providing ACH processing, remotely created check processing and similar services to us. If our access to any of these means of payment processing is impaired, we may find it difficult or impossible to continue some or all of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to maintain access to needed services on favorable terms, we would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of our business if alternative processors are not available.\nThe failure to comply with debt collection regulations could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business.\nThe FDCPA regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Many states impose additional requirements on persons collecting or attempting to collect consumer debts owed to them and on debt collection communications, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nOn May 7, 2019, the CFPB issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the FDCPA (the \u201cProposed Debt Collection Rule\u201d) which would apply to third-party debt collectors covered by the FDCPA, including our attempts to collect certain debt originated by other lenders such as under our CSO program. In the fall of 2020, the CFPB issued its final debt collection rule in two parts. The first part, issued on October 30, 2020: (a) clarifies the times and places at which a debt collector may communicate with a consumer; (b) requires collectors to provide a channel-specific opt-out mechanism for debtors in all text messages and emails; and (c) provides that a debt collector is presumed to violate the rule if it places a telephone call to a person more than 7 times within a 7-day period or within 7 days after a telephone conversation with the debtor. The second part, issued on December 18, 2020: (a) includes prohibitions against taking or threatening legal action on time-barred debt outside of proofs of claim filed in bankruptcy proceedings; (b) requires debt collectors to speak to a consumer in person or by phone or send a letter or electronic message and wait a reasonable period of time before furnishing information to a credit reporting agency; and (c) adopts a set of specifications for the information that should be included in debt validation notices and when and how the validation notice should be provided to consumers. Both rules became effective November 30, 2021. Creditors and other first-party collectors are not subject to the final rules, but they will impact Enova\u2019s third-party collectors and debt buyers. Restrictions on our third-party debt collectors or that apply to our attempts to collect debt originated by other lenders, may have an adverse impact on our U.S. products and services.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions also regulate debt collection. We could be subject to fines, written orders or other penalties if we, or parties working on our behalf, are determined to have violated the FDCPA or analogous state or international laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe use lead providers and marketing affiliates to assist us in obtaining new customers, and if lead providers or marketing affiliates do not comply with an increasing number of applicable laws and regulations, or if our ability to use such lead providers or marketing affiliates is otherwise impaired, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on third parties, referred to as lead providers (or lead generators) and marketing affiliates, as a source of new customers. Our marketing affiliates place our advertisements on their websites that direct potential customers to our websites. Generally, lead providers operate, and also work with their own marketing affiliates who operate, separate websites to attract prospective customers and then sell those \u201cleads\u201d to online lenders. As a result, the success of our business depends substantially on the willingness and ability of lead providers or marketing affiliates to provide us customer leads at acceptable prices.\nIf regulatory oversight of lead providers or marketing affiliates is increased, through the implementation of new laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates could be restricted or eliminated. For example, the CFPB has indicated its intention to examine compliance with federal laws and regulations by lead providers and to scrutinize the flow of non-public, private consumer information between lead providers and lead buyers, such as us. Over the past few years, several states have taken actions that have caused us to discontinue the use of lead providers in those states. While these discontinuations did not have a material adverse effect on us, other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers and potentially on marketing affiliates in the future, and if other states adopt similar restrictions, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates in those states would also be interrupted.\nLead providers\u2019 or marketing affiliates\u2019 failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any changes in laws or regulations applicable to lead providers or marketing affiliates\u2019 or changes in the interpretation or implementation of such laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business and could increase negative perceptions of our business and industry. Additionally, the use of lead providers and marketing affiliates could subject us to additional regulatory cost and expense. If our ability to use lead generators or marketing affiliates were to be impaired, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we do business with third parties who are not part of our funding advisor program, including third parties who may refer potential small business customers to us or to whom we may refer potential customers for their business. In general, if we refer an applicant that takes a loan from one of our strategic partners, that strategic partner pays us a commission based on the amount of the originated loan. The partners determine whether to extend credit to referred applicants using their own credit models and criteria.\nCertain states require a license to broker commercial loans or apply other restrictions to loan brokering activities. We believe that our strategic referral program for small business products would not be considered loan brokering under those state laws and, as such, would not require us to obtain a license. There is a risk that states could adopt new laws or amend or interpret existing laws to require us to obtain a broker license, impose penalties for noncompliance, or otherwise prevent us from making further referrals and collecting commissions from our referral partners. Challenges to our program could also result in costly and time-consuming litigation, damage to our reputation and harm our operating results.\nTo the extent that funding advisor program partners, other third parties or internal sales representatives mislead loan applicants or engage or previously engaged in disreputable behavior, our reputation may be harmed and we may face liability.\nWe rely on third-party independent advisors, including commercial loan brokers, which we call funding advisor program partners, or FAPs, for a significant portion of the customers to whom we issue loans. As a consequence of their status as independent contractors who provide services for multiple lenders, we have less control of third-party independent sales activities as compared to the activities of our internal sales representatives.\nBecause FAPs earn fees on a commission basis, FAPs may have an incentive to mislead loan applicants, facilitate the submission by loan applicants of false application data or engage in other disreputable behavior so as to earn additional commissions. We also rely on our internal sales representatives for customer acquisition in our direct marketing channel, who may also be motivated to engage in disreputable behavior to increase our customer base because such internal sales representatives are paid on a commission basis. If FAPs or our internal sales representatives mislead our customers or engage in other disreputable behavior, our customers are less likely to be satisfied with their experience and we may be subject to costly and time-consuming disputes. Negative publicity relating to FAPs or internal sales representatives could impair our ability to continue to increase our revenue and our business could otherwise be materially and negatively impacted.\nWe significantly enhanced, and regularly update, the nature and scope of the due diligence conducted on both prospective and existing FAPs. We also implemented certain enhanced contractual provisions and compliance-related measures related to our funding advisor program. While these measures were intended to improve certain aspects and reduce the risks of how we work with funding advisors and how they work with our customers, we cannot assure that these measures will work or continue to work as intended, that other compliance-related concerns will not emerge in the future, that the funding advisors will comply with these measures, and that these measures will not negatively impact our business from this channel or have other unintended or negative impacts on our business beyond the FAP channel.\nIn addition, we do business with third parties who are not part of our funding advisor program, including third parties who may refer potential customers to us. Although such third parties are solely intended to refer to our internal processes we are exposed to the risks of potential misleading or disreputable behavior from these third parties as well as from our FAPs.\nAs to our sales force, sales representatives are given sales scripts and receive rigorous training, including in-person training on avoiding unfair, abusive, and deceptive practices. In addition, internal sales representative calls are recorded and monitored for purposes of compliance and quality assurance. Despite these controls, we cannot assure that that they will work as intended or that all of our internal sales representatives will comply with our procedures. Failure of our internal sales representatives to do so would expose us to the same, or worse, consequences than those relating to the FAP channel. We also refer merchants to third party lenders. It is conceivable that we are exposed to risk if such third- party lenders engage in wrongful behavior.\nWe pay commissions to our strategic partners, other third parties and FAPs upfront and generally do not recover them in the event the related term loan or line of credit is eventually charged off.\nWe pay commissions to strategic partners and FAPs on the business installment loans and lines of credit we originate through these channels. We pay these commissions at the time the installment loan is originated or line of credit is opened. OnDeck also paid such commissions on equipment finance loans. We generally do not require that this commission be repaid to us in the event of a default on an installment loan or line of credit. In certain circumstances we are entitled to recover some or all of commission paid for equipment finance originations. While we generally discontinue working with strategic partners and FAPs that refer customers to us that ultimately have unacceptably high levels of defaults, to the extent that our strategic partners and FAPs are not at risk of forfeiting their commissions in the event of defaults, they may, to an extent, be indifferent to the riskiness of the potential customers that they refer to us.\nAny violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or the failure to detect any such violations, may cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to be adversely affected.\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits us and our employees from engaging in unethical business practices. In addition, our FAPs are required to comply with a code of conduct, or the FAP Code, tailored to their brokering services. We refer to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the FAP Code collectively as the \u201cCode.\u201d However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents, or contractors will refrain from acting in violation of our Code, or that we will be able to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of our Code, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If we, or our employees, agents or contractors, are found to have engaged in practices that violate our Code, we could suffer severe fines, penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us, or our employees, agents or contractors acting on our behalf, in any number of activities or circumstances in violation of our Code, including employment related offenses, such as harassment (sexual or otherwise) and discrimination, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of data and systems, or from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct.\nThe use of personal data for credit underwriting is highly regulated.\nIn the United States, the FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Compliance with the FCRA and related laws and regulations concerning consumer reports has recently been under regulatory scrutiny. The FCRA requires us to provide a Notice of Adverse Action to a consumer loan applicant when we deny an application for credit, which, among other things, informs the applicant of the action taken regarding the credit application and the specific reasons for the denial of credit. The FCRA also requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a consumer reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. Historically, the FTC has played a key role in the implementation, oversight, enforcement and interpretation of the FCRA. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has primary supervisory, regulatory and enforcement authority of FCRA issues, although the FTC also retains its enforcement role regarding the FCRA. The CFPB has taken a more active approach than the FTC, including with respect to regulation, enforcement and supervision of the FCRA. Changes in the regulation, enforcement or supervision of the FCRA may materially affect our business if new regulations or interpretations by the CFPB or the FTC require us to materially alter the manner in which we use personal data in our credit underwriting. The oversight of the FCRA by both the CFPB\nand the FTC and any related investigation or enforcement activities or our failure to comply with the DPA may have a material adverse impact on our business, including our operations, our mode and manner of conducting business and our financial results.\nIn 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and expands the privacy rights of California residents and regulates the sharing of consumer information of California residents. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d). The CPRA amends and expands the rights and obligations under the CCPA. Most of the CPRA\u2019s substantive provisions will not take effect until January 1, 2023. Once the CPRA takes effect, it will replace the CCPA, although in the interim, businesses must comply with the CCPA. Compliance with the CCPA and the CPRA may increase the cost of conducting business in California, and we could see increased litigation costs as a result of the enactment of these laws. Several other states, such as Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Washington, have proposed or passed legislation regarding data privacy and use, which could create more risks and potential costs.\nNegative public perception of our business could cause demand for our products to significantly decrease.\nIn recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on short-term and high-cost consumer loans. Such consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the annual percentage rate for this type of consumer loan, which is compared unfavorably to the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with top-tier credit histories. The fees and/or interest charged by us and others in the industry attract media publicity about the industry and may be perceived as controversial. If the negative characterization of these types of loans becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for any or all of the consumer loan products that we offer could significantly decrease, which could materially affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of loans is accepted by legislators and regulators, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to short-term loans or other consumer loan products that we offer that could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nIn addition, our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters-even if related to seemingly isolated incidents, or even if related to practices not specific to short-term loans, such as debt collection-could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could significantly decrease the demand for our products, could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nControl of the Congress and the executive branch of the U.S. government could have a significant impact on financial services legislation passed in Congress and signed into law.\nIn January 2019, the Democratic party took control of the House of Representatives, and in January 2021, the Democratic party took control of the Senate and Joseph Biden was inaugurated as President of the United States. The new administration has publicly discussed raising income tax rates, including corporate income taxes. Such legislation would likely lead to an increase in our total tax expense. Further, tax rate changes can also lead to discrete tax expense events at the time of enactment. We are unable to predict at this time the effect of any such new legislation or regulations.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have been and are currently subject to lawsuits (including purported class actions) that could cause us to incur substantial expenditures, generate adverse publicity and could significantly impair our business, force us to cease doing business in one or more jurisdictions or cause us to cease offering or alter one or more products. We are also likely to be subject to further litigation in the future. An adverse ruling in or a settlement of any current or future litigation against us or another provider of loans or financings similar to those we offer could cause us to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, forego collection of the principal amount of loans or the delivery of purchased receivables, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties and/or modify or terminate our operations in particular jurisdictions.\nDefense of any lawsuit, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of our management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. We and others are also subject to regulatory proceedings, and we could suffer losses as a result of interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations in those regulatory proceedings, even if we are not a party to those proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rulemaking or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable.\nWe include arbitration provisions in our consumer and business loan and financing agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action liability. Our arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. We take the position that the arbitration provisions in loan and financing agreements, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject us to additional litigation, including additional class action litigation.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and also certain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to study consumer arbitration and report to the U.S. Congress, and it authorized the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent with the results of its study.\nThe CFPB did issue a final rule on arbitration, which would have prohibited class action waivers in certain consumer financial services contracts. However, the House and Senate each passed a resolution of disapproval of the rule, pursuant to their powers under the Congressional Review Act, and the President signed the bill. Because the rule was disapproved, it cannot be reissued in substantially the same form, and the CFPB cannot issue a substantially similar rule unless the new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\nAny judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers will increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn some circumstances, federal preemption and application of an out-of-state choice of law provision will not, or may not, be available for the benefit of certain non-bank purchasers of loans to defend against a state law claim of usury.\nOver the past few years there have been several litigation and enforcement actions aimed at issuing banks and their non-bank lending partners. These actions have primarily challenged the validity of the issuing bank partner model that is used by many non-bank lenders, including by the Company.\nIn May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that federal law did not preempt a state\u2019s interest rate limitations when applied to a non-bank debt buyer of a consumer credit card loan seeking to collect interest at the rate originally contracted for by a national bank.\nIn June 2020, each of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) implemented rules to address the valid-when-made doctrine and the uncertainty created by the Madden case. Generally, the rules clarify that the permissible interest on a loan is determined at the time the loan is made by national banks, Federal savings associations, state banks and insured branches of foreign banks and such permissible interest rate is not affected by a subsequent sale, assignment or other transfer to non-bank financial companies or a subsequent change in state law. In July 2020, the attorneys general for California, Illinois and New York filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the OCC rule on both substantive and procedural grounds. Additionally, in August 2020, the attorneys general for California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the FDIC rule on similar grounds. While both the OCC and FDIC rule will remain in effect absent a preliminary or final ruling by the court, uncertainty exists as to when and how this case will be resolved or whether any other challenges to the OCC or FDIC rules will arise.\nIf the rules are invalidated, the Second Circuit\u2019s holding in the Madden case would be binding on federal courts in the states included in the Second Circuit - New York, Connecticut and Vermont. If the Second Circuit's decision were then extended and upheld by courts outside of the Second Circuit, it could pose a challenge to the federal preemption of state interest rate limitations for loans made by our issuing bank partner in those states. Additionally, if the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York applying the law of the state of the borrower (rather than the governing law stated in the loan agreement) were applied by a state or federal court outside of the Southern District of New York, then loans originated by us (or a portion of the principal and/or interest on such loans) might be unenforceable, and penalties could apply depending if the terms of such loans were deemed contrary to the law of\nthe state of the borrower. There could be other related liabilities and reputational harm if the Company or a subsequent transferee of a bank-issued loan were to seek to collect on those amounts deemed to be in violation of applicable state law.\nWhile the Madden decision suggests that non-bank purchasers may not be entitled to utilize federal preemption of state interest rate limitations for loans made by issuing bank partners in those states, there have also been numerous litigation and enforcement actions that challenge the status of the issuing bank partner as the \u201ctrue lender\u201d of the loan in question. These actions primarily rely on the reasoning set forth in CashCall, Inc. v. Morrisey. In that case, the court held that the non-bank consumer lending platform, CashCall, and not its bank partner, was the \u201ctrue lender\u201d for certain loans made to West Virginia residents. The court relied on a \u201cpredominate economic interest\u201d test that sought to determine which party (as between the issuing bank and the non-bank lending platform) retained the most economic risk in the loan transaction and should, therefore, be deemed the \u201ctrue lender\u201d of the loan. The CashCall decision and other similar actions challenge whether the loans should be subject to the interest rate limitations in the state where the consumer is located rather than in the bank\u2019s home state because the non-bank lending platform, and not the bank, is the \u201ctrue lender.\u201d The state law remedies with respect to the \u201ctrue lender\u201d actions vary depending on the jurisdiction in which the action is filed.\nOn October 27, 2020, the OCC issued a final rule, which was effective December 29, 2020, that determines when a national bank or Federal savings association makes a loan and therefore is the \u201ctrue lender\u201d in the context of a partnership between a bank and a third party. The rule provides that a national bank or Federal savings association makes a loan if, as of the date of origination, it (1) is named as the lender in the loan agreement or (2) it funds the loan. On January 5, 2021, the attorneys general from seven states - New York, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and North Carolina - and the District of Columbia filed suit against the OCC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the rule. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed a joint resolution to repeal the OCC\u2019s True Lender Rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. If we were deemed by a court to be the \u201ctrue lender\u201d of any loans originated by the issuing bank partner, it could impact the enforceability of the loans; it could subject us to regulatory investigations, penalties and fines; we might have to alter the terms of the loans we broker; it could create challenges for our capital markets and securitization models; we would have to change the way we do business in such jurisdictions; and we may suffer an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our relationship with certain of our issuing bank partners was to end or the legal structure supporting such relationship was to be successfully challenged, then we may have to comply with additional laws, regulations, and restrictions, and certain states may require us to obtain a lending or similar license.\nIn states that do not require a license to make commercial loans, we make certain small business loans directly to customers pursuant to a specific state\u2019s law. However, some states and jurisdictions require a license to make or solicit certain commercial loans in that state or jurisdiction and/or may not honor the choice of another state\u2019s law. These states assert either that their own licensing laws and requirements should generally apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of their state or apply to commercial loans made by nonbanks to residents of their state of certain principal amounts or with certain interest rates or other terms. In such states and jurisdictions and in some other circumstances, certain of our small business loans are originated by an issuing bank partner, which is not subject to state licensing, offered to us for sake. With respect to OnDeck loans, a bank currently originates all loans in certain states as well as some loans to customers in other states and jurisdictions. These loans are not governed by Virginia law, but rather the laws of the issuing bank partner\u2019s home state. The remainder of OnDeck loans provide that they are governed by Virginia law. Loans originated by our issuing bank partner are generally priced the same as loans originated by us under Virginia law. While the other U.S. states where we originate loans currently honor our choice of law, future legal changes could result in any one or more of those states no longer honoring our choice of law or introducing a new licensing regime applicable to our business. In that case, we could potentially address the legal change by altering the terms of our loans, curtailing our originations, or placing more loans through our issuing bank partner.\nIf we were otherwise not able to work with an issuing bank partner or if we were to seek to make loans directly in certain states, we would have to attempt to comply with the laws of these states in other ways, including through obtaining the appropriate licenses. Compliance with the laws of such states could be costly, and if we are unable to obtain such licenses, our lending activity could substantially decrease or cease entirely in that state jurisdiction and our revenues, growth and profitability would be harmed.\nIf our relationship with an issuing bank partner were to end or if any other issuing bank partner were to cease operations, we would either need to find a replacement financial institution with which to enter into a similar arrangement or we would need to obtain individual federal, state or local lending licenses or otherwise comply with the laws of those jurisdictions in order to continue to make certain small business loans in those jurisdictions. Even if we were able to obtain the necessary licenses in those jurisdictions, compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of those jurisdictions could be costly and, depending on the terms of the loans, the interest rates or other loan terms and practices applicable to small business loans in those jurisdictions might be subject to limits, prohibitions or restrictions. If we were unable to maintain the necessary relationships, unable to obtain the necessary licenses or unable to otherwise comply with applicable law, we would be required to discontinue or curtail certain of our commercial lending, or limit the rates of interest charged on certain small business loans, in those jurisdictions and would face increased costs and compliance burdens.\nIn addition, if it were found that our activities under our current arrangements with our issuing bank partner constituted impermissible commercial lending within any such jurisdiction, we could face penalties and fines within such jurisdictions, and all or a portion of the interest charged on the small business loans and/or all or a portion of the principal of the small business loans could be found to be unenforceable or recoverable by the borrower and, to the extent it is determined that the small business loans were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we could be obligated to purchase certain small business loans that failed to comply with such legal requirements. Further, any finding that we engaged in commercial lending in states where we are not properly licensed to do so could lead to litigation, harm to our reputation and negatively impact our ability to originate small business loans.\nThe failure of third parties who provide products, services or support to us to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt our operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nA portion of our short-term consumer loan and installment loan revenue depends in part on the willingness and ability of unaffiliated third-party lenders, through the CSO program, to make loans to customers. We also utilize many other third parties to provide services to facilitate our lending and financing, including in our underwriting and payment processing. In addition, we rely on a third party lender in connection with our lending business in Brazil. The loss of the relationship with any of these third parties, and an inability to replace them or the failure of these third parties to maintain quality and consistency in their programs or services or to have the ability to provide their products and services, could cause us to lose customers and substantially decrease the revenue and earnings of our business. Our revenue and earnings could also be adversely affected if any of those third-party providers make material changes to the products or services that we rely on. We also use third parties to support and maintain certain of our communication systems and information systems. If a third-party provider fails to provide its products or services, makes material changes to such products and services, does not maintain its quality and consistency or fails to have the ability to provide its products and services, our operations could be disrupted. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems, as well as the ability of such systems to support compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our employees\u2019 ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as internet support, contact center activities, and processing and servicing of our loans and receivables purchase agreements. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which our internet operations and other technology infrastructure are based, such as a power outage, a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of our ability to underwrite, approve and process loans and finance receivables, provide customer service, perform collections activities, or perform other necessary business functions. Any such interruption could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, our systems and those of third parties on whom we rely must comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and be capable of timely modification to comply with new or amended requirements. Any such systems problems going forward could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows and could impair or prohibit our ability to continue current operations.\nDecreased demand for our products and specialty financial services and our failure to adapt to such decrease could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, such as regulatory restrictions that reduce customer access to particular products, the availability of competing or alternative products or changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions. Should we fail to adapt to a significant change in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products, our revenue could decrease significantly. Even if we make adaptations or introduce new products to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time. In particular, we have changed, and will continue to change, some of our operations and the products we offer. Any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPotential union activities could have an adverse effect on our relationship with our workforce.\nNone of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by an employee union. Occasionally we experience union organizing activities. If our employees become represented by an employee union or become subject to a collective bargaining agreement, it may make it more difficult for us to manage our business and to attract and retain new employees and may increase our cost of doing business. Having our employees become represented by an employee union, having a collective bargaining\nagreement or having additional requirements related to our employees imposed on us could result in work stoppages and higher employee costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nThe determination of the fair values of the Company\u2019s loan and finance receivables portfolio involves unobservable inputs that can be highly subjective and may prove to be materially different than the actual economic outcome.\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we began utilizing the fair value option for our loan and finance receivables portfolio effective January 1, 2020. The fair values of our loans and finance receivables are determined using Level 3 inputs for which changes could significantly impact our fair value measurements. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. A variety of factors including, but not limited to, estimated customer default rates, the timing of expected payments, utilization rates on our line of credit accounts, estimated costs to service the portfolio, discount rates, and valuations of comparable portfolios may ultimately affect the fair values of our loans and finance receivables. Modifications to our assumptions due to the passage of time and more information becoming available could result in material changes to our fair value calculations. These changes to fair value could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, under the fair value option, these changes are generally recorded directly to the income statement, which may make our financial statements less comparable to others in the industry that do not record their loan balances under the fair value option.\nWe are subject to impairment risk.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had goodwill totaling $279.3 million on our consolidated balance sheets, all of which represents assets capitalized in connection with acquisitions and business combinations. Accounting for goodwill requires significant management estimates and judgment. Events may occur in the future, and we may not realize the value of our goodwill. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also lead to our inability to comply with certain covenants in our financing documents, which could cause a default under those agreements.\nIf the information provided by customers to us is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer\u2019s qualification to receive a loan and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur lending decisions are based partly on information provided to us by loan applicants. To the extent that these applicants provide information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, our loan decisioning process, including the OnDeck Score\u00ae, may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources is a significant component of our loan decisioning and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nIn addition, we use identity and fraud checks analyzing data provided by external databases to authenticate each customer\u2019s identity. From time to time in the past, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could also fail in the future, and fraud, which may be significant, may occur. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, operating results and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation, and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nWe are subject to anticorruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions laws, and our failure to comply therewith, particularly as we continue to expand internationally, could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAnticorruption Laws. We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, such policies or procedures may not work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future.\nOther countries in which we operate or have operated, including Brazil, Australia, Canada and other countries where we intend to operate also have anticorruption laws, which we are, have been or will be subject to.\nIf we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAnti-Money Laundering Laws. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and related compliance obligations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In the United States, the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act require us to maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. The program must include: (1) the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; (2) designation of a compliance officer; (3) an ongoing employee training program; and (4) an independent audit function to test the program. If we are not in compliance with U.S. or other anti-money laundering laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of anti-money laundering laws by U.S. or international authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic Sanctions Laws. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. In particular, the United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals,\u201d such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These prohibitions are administered by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual, entity or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity or country has an interest. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Other countries in which we operate also maintain economic and financial sanctions regimes. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. If we are not in compliance with OFAC regulations and other economic and financial sanctions regulations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any investigation of any potential violations of OFAC regulations or other economic sanctions by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur continued international expansion could increase the risk of violations of FCPA, anti-money laundering laws, OFAC regulations, or similar applicable laws and regulations in the future.\nFailure of operating controls could produce a significant negative outcome, including customer experience degradation, legal expenses, increased regulatory cost, significant internal and external fraud losses and vendor risk.\nLosses from operational failures can be material. These losses can arise from a wide range of breaches in controls, procedures, processes and security. Breaches in any of these controls, procedures, processes or security measures could lead to significant legal expense and, even, punitive damages. Internal fraud, including the stealing and dissemination of client personally identifiable information, can create significant client distrust and result in serious legal action against us. Breaches in client onboarding and servicing processes can degrade customer experience and place current and future revenues at risk. The continued proliferation and technological advances in first and third-party fraud can result in large losses over a short period of time if undetected. While we seek to enhance and develop our operational risk strategy and control structure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful and that we will avoid material operational losses. These potential operational risk loss scenarios are not exhaustive and we could experience a significant loss in any scenario if our operational risk enhancements do not keep pace with our business, capabilities or our continued organizational growth and complexity. In addition, operational failures could have a significant effect on our reputation which could cause additional material harm to our business and prospects.\nIncreased competition from banks, credit card companies, other consumer lenders, and other entities offering similar financial products and services could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have many competitors. Our principal competitors are consumer loan and finance companies, CSOs, online lenders, credit card companies, auto title lenders and other financial institutions that offer similar financial products and services, including loans on an unsecured as well as a secured basis. Many other financial institutions or other businesses that do not now offer products or services directed toward our traditional customer base, many of whom may be much larger than us, could begin doing so. Significant increases\nin the number and size of competitors for our business could result in a decrease in the number of loans that we fund or necessitate a change in the terms of the loans that we offer, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings in these categories.\nCompetitors of our business may operate, or begin to operate, under business models less focused on legal and regulatory compliance, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Some of our U.S. competitors operate using other business models, including a \u201ctribal model\u201d where the lender follows the laws of a Native American tribe regardless of the state in which the customer resides. Competitors using these models may be able to lend in jurisdictions where we do not and may have higher revenue per customer and significantly less burdensome compliance requirements, among other advantages. Additionally, negative perceptions about these models could cause legislators or regulators to pursue additional industry restrictions that could affect the business model under which we operate. To the extent that these models or other new lending models gain acceptance among consumers, small businesses and investors or that they face less onerous regulatory restrictions than we do, we may be unable to replicate their business practices or otherwise compete with them effectively, which could cause demand for our products to decline substantially. We may be unable to compete successfully against any or all of our current or future competitors. As a result, we could lose market share and our revenue could decline, thereby affecting our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operations. Any such changes in our competition could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our officers, and if we are not able to attract and retain qualified officers, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on our officers, which are a relatively small group of individuals. Many members of the senior management team have significant industry experience, and we believe that our senior management would be difficult to replace, if necessary. Because the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified officers or candidates. In addition, increasing regulations on and negative publicity about the consumer financial services industry could affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified officers, it could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur international operations subject us to foreign exchange risk.\nWe are subject to the risk of unexpected changes in foreign currency exchange rates by virtue of our loans to residents of Brazil and businesses in Canada and Australia. In 2021, 1.9% of our total revenue was derived from our international operations. Our results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international businesses are denominated in their respective currencies and are, as a result, exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, our operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.\nA sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce demand for our products and services and result in reduced earnings.\nA sustained deterioration in the economy could cause deterioration in the performance of our loan and finance receivables portfolios. An economic slowdown could result in a decreased number of loans and financing being made to customers due to higher unemployment or an increase in defaults in our products. During an economic slowdown, we could be required to tighten our underwriting standards, which would likely reduce loan and finance receivable balances, and we could face more difficulty in collecting defaulted receivables, which could lead to an increase in losses.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and analytics or keep up with that of our competitors.\nThe success of our business depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software, fraud defenses, underwriting algorithms and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information, detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors could, without violating our proprietary rights, develop technologies that are as good as or better than our technology. Our failure to protect our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights or to develop technologies that are as good as our competitors\u2019 could put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. Any such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering certain products or product features, acquire licenses, which may not be available at a commercially reasonable price or at all, or modify our products, product features, processes or websites while we develop non-infringing substitutes.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our technology platform and plan to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, potentially including our valuable proprietary code, or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform, any of which could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We are entirely dependent on the secure operation of our websites and systems as well as the operation of the internet generally. While we have incurred no material cyber-attacks or security breaches to date, a number of other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or both. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, our security measures may not provide absolute security. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used by hackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications or expand into new countries. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, customer and/or supplier perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers, suppliers or both. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our applicants provide sensitive information, including bank account information when applying for loans or financing. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues. In addition, federal and some state regulators are considering rules and standards to address cybersecurity risks and many U.S. states have already enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and may lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures.\nOur servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including denial-of-service attacks. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach of our systems or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of consumers\u2019 personal information or businesses\u2019 proprietary information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services or support to us could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact our customers and our business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue.\nAny of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ability to collect payment on loans and maintain the accuracy of accounts may be adversely affected by computer viruses, electronic break-ins, technical errors and similar disruptions.\nThe accessibility and automated nature of our platform may make for an attractive target for hacking, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our platform, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, in which case there would be an\nincreased risk of fraud or identity theft, and we may experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced loan. In addition, the software that we have developed is highly complex and may contain undetected technical errors that could cause our computer systems to fail. Because each loan and financing provided involves our proprietary underwriting and fraud scoring models, and the applications are highly automated, any failure of our computer systems involving our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our proprietary underwriting and fraud scoring models could compromise the ability to accurately evaluate potential customers, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations that may result in disruptions or reductions in the amount of collections from the loans and financings we provide to customers. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf internet search engine providers change their methodologies for organic rankings or paid search results, or our organic rankings or paid search results decline for other reasons, our new customer growth or volume from returning customers could decline.\nOur new customer acquisition marketing and our returning customer relationship management is partly dependent on search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! to direct a significant amount of traffic to our desktop and mobile websites via organic ranking and paid search advertising. Our competitors\u2019 paid search activities, pay per click or search engine marketing may result in their sites receiving higher paid search results than ours and significantly increasing the cost of such advertising for us.\nOur paid search activities may not produce (and in the past have not always produced) the desired results. Internet search engines often revise their methodologies, which could adversely affect our organic rankings or paid search results, resulting in a decline in our new customer growth or existing customer retention, difficulty for our customers in using our web and mobile sites, more successful organic rankings, paid search results or tactical execution efforts for our competitors than for us, a slowdown in overall growth in our customer base and the loss of existing customers, and higher costs for acquiring returning customers, which could adversely impact our business. In addition, search engines could implement policies that restrict the ability of consumer finance companies such as us to advertise their services and products, which could preclude companies in our industry from appearing in a favorable location or any location in the organic rankings or paid search results when certain search terms are used by the consumer. For example, in 2016, Google implemented a new policy that prohibits lenders, lead providers and affiliates from advertising certain financial products on Google AdWords. Advertisements for personal loans that require repayment within 60 days, or U.S. loans with an APR of 36 percent or more, are no longer allowed on Google paid search advertising. In addition, Google requires that advertisements for personal loans contain or link to information about the features, fees, risks and benefits of the advertised loan product.\nOur online marketing efforts are also susceptible to actions by third parties that could negatively impact our search results. Our sites have experienced meaningful fluctuations in organic rankings and paid search results in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of consumers or small businesses directed to our web and mobile sites could harm our business and operating results.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could adversely impact our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur services and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, other natural disasters, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, public health crises and similar events. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we may take, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. Because we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and cause lengthy delays which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or other disruptions. Any of these events could cause consumer and small business confidence to decrease, which could result in a decreased number of loans and financing being made to customers. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to keep up with the rapid changes in e-commerce and the uses and regulation of the internet could harm our business.\nThe business of providing products and services such as ours over the internet is dynamic and relatively new. We must keep pace with rapid technological change, consumer and small business use habits, internet security risks, risks of system failure or inadequacy, and governmental regulation and taxation, and each of these factors could adversely impact our business. In addition, concerns about fraud, computer security and privacy and/or other problems may discourage additional consumers and small businesses from adopting or\ncontinuing to use the internet as a medium of commerce. In countries such as the United States, where e-commerce generally has been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our online financial services is relatively high, acquiring new customers for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire customers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to conduct their financial services transactions. If these customers prove to be less profitable than our previous customers, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and internationally that involve user privacy issues, data protection, advertising, marketing, disclosures, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and online payment services. The introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations. In addition, international data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations, which can be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change, and the U.S. government, including the FTC and the Commerce Department, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving e-commerce industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current or past policies and practices. A number of proposals are pending before federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. There have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas such as privacy. In addition, some countries are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, would increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, the expansion into new markets, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices or pay fines, penalties or other damages.\nGrowth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure and could be costly.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in our business. This growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Expanding our products or entering into new jurisdictions with new or existing products can be costly and require significant management time and attention. Additionally, as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity and our product offerings increase, we will need to enhance and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of enhanced solutions, features and functionality. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, develop and enhance our legal and compliance controls and processes, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense and is particularly intense for technology and analytics professionals. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources or more attractive compensation mixes than we have had. Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. Failure to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations.\nNew top-level domain names may allow the entrance of new competitors or dilution of our brands, which may reduce the value of our domain name assets.\nWe have invested heavily in promoting our brands, including our website addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the entity responsible for administering internet protocol addresses, has introduced additional new domain name suffixes in different formats, many of which may be more attractive than the formats held by us and which may allow the entrance of new competitors at limited cost. It may also permit other operators to register websites with addresses similar to ours, causing customer confusion and dilution of our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any defensive domain registration strategy or attempts to protect our trademarks or brands could become a large and recurring expense and may not be successful.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of OnDeck, and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the OnDeck business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the transaction, including anticipated annual operating cost and capital synergies to the extent anticipated. Difficulties in integrating OnDeck into our operations may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated synergies and efficiencies in the expected time frame or at all. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings and markets and grow our business in response to changing customer demands, regulatory environments, technologies and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may expand our offerings through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the business that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us. In addition, we may issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or may expose us to additional material liabilities. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our operating results.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain will vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and management\u2019s decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that could result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our financial statements and certain tax positions taken by us require the judgment of management, and we could be subject to risks associated with these judgments or could be adversely affected by the implementation of new, or changes in the interpretation of existing, accounting principles, financial reporting requirements or tax rules.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we began utilizing the fair value option for our loan and finance receivables portfolio effective January 1, 2020. The fair values of our loans and finance receivables are determined using Level 3 inputs for which changes could significantly impact our fair value measurements. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. A variety of factors including, but not limited to, estimated customer default rates, the timing of expected payments, estimated utilization rates on line of credit accounts, estimated costs to service the portfolio, interest rates, and valuations of comparable portfolios may ultimately affect the fair values of our loans and finance receivables. Modifications to our assumptions due to the passage of time and more information becoming available could result in material changes to our fair value calculations.\nManagement\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Management\u2019s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under Accounting Standards Codification 740-10-25, Income Taxes. Management\u2019s interpretations of tax laws are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and disputes may occur regarding our view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, Management may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations,\nand business strategies. It is possible that revisions in Management\u2019s estimate of income taxes may materially affect our results of operations in any reporting period. Management regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and Management records additional reserves as appropriate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, among other items, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. While U.S. tax reform has reduced our effective tax rate, additional guidance or interpretations of the Tax Act could negatively impact our financial results.\nIn addition, we prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and its interpretations are subject to change over time. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to restate historical financial reporting.\nOur U.S. consumer and small business loan businesses are seasonal in nature, which causes our cash flows to fluctuate over the year.\nOur U.S. consumer and small business loan businesses are affected by fluctuating demand for our products and services and fluctuating collection rates throughout the year. Demand for our consumer loan products in the United States has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the holiday season, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers\u2019 receipt of income tax refunds. Demand for our small business loan products and services in the United States has historically been highest in the fourth quarter and early first quarter of each year, corresponding generally to holiday and post-holiday season needs, and lowest at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter of each year, where we believe that our customers\u2019 businesses are generally slower. This seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year. If our originations were to increase and our collections were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods, our ability to service debt and meet our other liquidity requirements may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under anticipated agreements governing our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,384.4 million of total debt outstanding. Interest expense on our indebtedness totaled $77.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent that our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face would increase.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness (including the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement, as defined under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report) contain various restrictive covenants and, in the case of the Credit Agreement, and certain of the securitization facilities assumed in the OnDeck acquisition, require that we maintain certain financial ratios that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictive covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022incur or permit certain liens to exist;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another company;\n\u2022make certain dispositions;\n\u2022make certain payments; and\n\u2022engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of all of these covenants and restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nAny failure to comply with any of these financial and other affirmative and negative covenants could constitute an event of default or trigger an amortization event under our debt agreements, entitling the lenders to, among other things, terminate future credit availability (including under our Credit Agreement), and/or increase the interest rate on outstanding debt, and/or accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under our debt agreements. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such debt agreements that are secured, the applicable lenders and noteholders could seek remedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities. An acceleration of the debt under certain facilities could also lead to a default under other facilities due to cross-acceleration provisions. Any such default could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could impair our ability to continue current operations. In addition, we act as servicer with respect to certain of our securitization facilities. If we default in our servicing obligations, an early amortization event or default could occur with respect to the applicable facility and we could be replaced as servicer.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information concerning our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial condition and operating performance and our ability to enter into other debt financings, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. For information regarding the risks to our business that could impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, and lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of certain assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations\nthen due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nChanges in our financial condition or a potential disruption in the capital markets could reduce available capital.\nIf funds are not available from our operations and any excess cash or from our Credit Agreement, we may be required to access the banking and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. We also expect to periodically access the debt capital markets to obtain capital to finance growth. Efficient access to the debt capital markets will be critical to our ongoing financial success; however, our future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of our earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, or overall business or industry prospects, adverse regulatory changes, a disruption to or deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward our industry by market participants. Disruptions and volatility in the capital markets may cause banks and other credit providers to restrict availability of new credit. Due to the negative bias toward our industry, commercial banks and other lenders have restricted access to available credit to participants in our industry, and we may have more limited access to commercial bank lending than other businesses. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, and a potential disruption in the capital markets may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges and this, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans. Additionally, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility, and the availability of funds is limited, third parties with whom we do business may incur increased costs or business disruption and this could adversely affect our business relationships with such third parties.\nIncreases in customer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to lenders under debt facilities and investors in securitizations which may adversely affect our access to financing and our business.\nIncreases in customer default rates could make us and our loans less attractive to our existing (or prospective) funding sources. If our existing funding sources do not achieve their desired financial returns or if they suffer losses, they (or prospective funding sources) may increase the cost of providing future financing or refuse to provide future financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Certain of our securitization facilities at and asset-backed notes issued by our subsidiaries are non-recourse to Enova and are collateralized by our loans. If the loans securing such securitization facilities and asset-backed notes fail to perform as expected, the lenders under our securitization facilities and investors in our asset-backed notes, or future lenders or investors in similar arrangements, may increase the cost of providing financing or refuse to provide financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail or cease our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the designations, powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of our preferred stock, including the number of shares, in any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter, or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our stock.\nIn addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022a separate vote of 80% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock in order for stockholders to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022changes in federal, state or international laws and regulations affecting our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by research analysts following our common stock or the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in the United States or international economies;\n\u2022terrorist acts or wars or other major catastrophic events;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic initiatives;\n\u2022the trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022the other risks and uncertainties described herein.\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political, and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence or interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition of OnDeck.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if, among other things, the combined company is unable to achieve the expected benefits of the transaction (including anticipated annual operating cost and capital synergies) in connection with the integration of our businesses, or if the transaction costs related to the acquisition are greater than expected. The market price also may decline if the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisition on the combined company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish research that is unfavorable about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have a limited number of analysts who are publishing research about us. In the event that one or more of our analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, demand for our stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders will need to sell their shares of common stock to receive any income or realize a return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock may be limited by the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and are limited by the terms of the Credit Agreement, 2024 Senior Notes, 2025 Senior Notes and our loan securitization facilities. The future payment of dividends, if permitted, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deem relevant. As a result, to receive any income or realize a return on their investment, our stockholders will need to sell their shares of common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us\narising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14960, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "ENVA"}
