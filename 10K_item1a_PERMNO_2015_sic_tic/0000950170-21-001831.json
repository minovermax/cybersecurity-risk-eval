{"cik": "1171155", "company": "RADIANT LOGISTICS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-09-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISKS PARTICULAR TO OUR BUSINESS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The future trading price of shares of our common stock will be affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions.\nRisks Related to our Business\nCOVID-19 or other health crises may adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread implications and while we see improvements in the broader economy, it is difficult to predict how COVID-19 will impact the overall economy in the future. Many countries have begun the process of vaccinating their residents against COVID-19. However, the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines, as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccines against new variants of the virus, may impact the economy as well as our operations in the future. Our results for the fiscal year 2021 showed encouraging recovery as we navigate through this unique environment. While we are seeing positive results despite the current COVID-19 environment, there remains uncertainty regarding how COVID-19 will impact the Company's results in the future.\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may last for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending as well as customers' ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance.\nWe need to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner network to increase revenues.\nWe sell our services through Company-owned locations operating under the Radiant brands and through a network of independently owned strategic operating partners throughout North America operating under the Airgroup, Adcom, DBA and Service by Air brands. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, approximately 52% and 55% of our consolidated net revenues (this is a non-GAAP measure, see further discussion and reconciliation to a GAAP measure in Item 7) was derived through our strategic operating partners. We believe our strategic operating partners will remain a critical component to our success for the foreseeable future. Although the terms of our strategic operating partner agreements vary widely, they generally cover the manner and amount of payments, the services to be performed, the length of the contract, and provide us with certain protections such as strategic operating partner-funded reserves against potential bad debts, indemnification obligations, and in certain instances include a personal guaranty of the independent owner(s) of the strategic operating partners. Certain of our strategic operating partner agreements are for defined terms, while others are subject to \u201cevergreen\u201d terms, or contain automatic renewal provisions or are at-will on a month-to-month basis. Regardless of stated term, in most situations the agreements can be terminated by the strategic operating partner with prior notice. As certain agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new agreements that provide for the same terms and economics as those previously agreed upon, if at all. Thus, we are subject to the risk of strategic operating partner terminations and the failure or refusal of certain of our strategic operating partners to renew their existing agreements. This risk is often accentuated upon the acquisition of a new agency-based network. We have a number of customers and strategic operating partner locations with significant volume and stature; however, no single customer or strategic operating partner location represents more than 10% of our consolidated revenue. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner relationships or enter into new strategic operating partner relationships, or that new or renewed strategic operating partner relationships will be available on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner relationships, renew existing strategic operating partner relationships, or enter into new strategic operating partner relationships, we may lose customers, customer introductions and co-marketing benefits, and our operating results may be negatively impacted. We may also be restricted from growing in certain territories or with certain customers, except through our strategic operating partners.\nIf our strategic operating partners fail to maintain adequate reserves against unpaid customer invoices, or if we are unable to offset against commissions earned and payable by us to our strategic operating partners for unpaid customer invoices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue pursuant to agreements with strategic operating partners operating under our various brands. Under these agreements, each individual strategic operating partner is responsible for some or all of the collection of amounts due from customers being serviced by such strategic operating partner. Certain of our strategic operating partners are required to maintain a security deposit with us to be used to fund those customer accounts ultimately not collected by us. We charge each of the strategic operating partners for any accounts receivable aged beyond 90 days. If the strategic operating partner\u2019s deposit with us has been depleted, an amount will be owed to us by our strategic operating partner. Based on legacy contracts assumed upon acquisition, some strategic operating partners are not required to maintain a security deposit, however, they are still responsible for deficits and their strategic operating partner agreements provide that we may withhold all or a portion of future commissions payable to the strategic operating partner in satisfaction of any deficit. As of June 30, 2021, approximately $1.0 million was owed to us by our strategic operating partners. To the extent any of these strategic operating partners cease operations or are otherwise unable to replenish these deficit accounts, we would be at risk of loss for any such amount. We include such amounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable the amounts owed will not be collected.\nFailure to comply with obligations as an \u201cindirect air carrier\u201d could result in penalties and fines and limit our ability to ship freight.\nWe are regulated, among other things, as \u201cindirect air carriers\u201d by the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security. These agencies provide requirements, guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry. We monitor our compliance and the compliance of our subsidiaries with such agency requirements. We rely on our strategic operating partners to monitor their own compliance, except when we are notified of a violation, when we may become involved. Failure to comply with these requirements, policies and procedures could result in penalties and fines. To date, a limited number of our strategic operating partners have been out of compliance with the \u201cindirect air carrier\u201d regulations, resulting in fines to us, which we attempt to collect from the strategic operating partners. There is no assurance that additional violations will not take place, which could result in penalties or fines or, in the extreme case, limits on our ability to ship freight.\nOur business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate information technology systems.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology platform in response to these trends, which may lead to significant ongoing software development or licensing costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our customers and strategic operating partners and the trends in the transportation services industry, or to design or license and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology platform in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. Despite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to our information technology systems and operations. We may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to customers or others, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. We must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer or businesses we acquire, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. We expect customers and strategic operating partners to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their supply chain services providers. If we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers\u2019 and strategic operating partners\u2019 demands, our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nIn addition, acquired companies will need to be integrated with our information technology systems, which may cause additional training or licensing cost, along with potential delays and disruption. In such event, our revenue, financial results and ability to operate profitably could be negatively impacted. The challenges associated with integration of our acquisitions may increase these risks.\nOur management information and financial reporting systems are spread across diverse platforms and geographies.\nThe growth of our business through acquisitions has resulted in our reliance on the accounting, business information, and other computer systems of these acquired entities to capture and transmit information concerning customer orders, carrier payment, payroll, and other critical business data. We continue to make progress towards migrating our various legacy operating and accounting systems to a new singular SAP-based system. As long as an acquired business remains on another information technology system, we face additional manual calculations, training costs, delays, and an increased possibility of inaccuracies in the data we use to manage our business and report our financial results. Any delay in compiling, assessing, and reporting information could adversely impact our business, our ability to timely react to changes in volumes, prices, or other trends, or to take actions to comply with financial covenants, all of which could negatively impact our stock price.\nWe depend on third-party carriers to transport our customers\u2019 cargo.\nWe rely on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators, ocean freight carriers, trucking companies, major U.S. railroads, other transportation companies, draymen and longshoremen for the movement of our customers\u2019 cargo. Consequently, our ability to provide services for our customers could be adversely impacted by, among other things: shortages in available cargo capacity; changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling, pricing, payment terms and frequency of service, increases in the cost of fuel, taxes and labor, changes in the financial stability or operating capabilities of carriers, and other factors not within our control. Reductions in airfreight or ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields. Material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation, whether caused by strike, work stoppage, lock-out, slowdown or otherwise, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, any determination that our third-party carriers have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation and brands, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to effectively manage our cost structure as we grow the business.\nWe have increased, and intend to further increase, our revenue through organic growth, adding strategic operating partners, and acquisitions. We believe that certain of our costs, such as those related to information technology, physical locations, senior management, and sales and general operations, and excluding non-cash amortization, should grow more slowly than our net revenue, which would lead to improved cash flow margins over time. Historically, our cash flow margins have fluctuated, and have not always improved as we have grown. To the extent we fail to manage our costs, including purchased transportation, strategic operating partner commissions, personnel expenses, and sales and general expenses, our profitability may not improve or may decrease. This could adversely impact our business, results of operation, financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonal trends.\nHistorically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. Our first and fourth fiscal quarters are traditionally weaker compared with our second and third fiscal quarters. As a result, our quarterly operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate. This trend is dependent on numerous factors, including the markets in which we operate, holiday seasons, climate, economic conditions and numerous other factors. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, which can sometimes be difficult to predict or are based on just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, our revenue is, to a large degree, affected by factors that are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nComparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to economic trends and consumer demand that can be difficult to predict or are based on just-in-time production schedules. Because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly, comparisons of our results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Additionally, the timing of acquisitions, as well as the revenue and expenses of the acquired operations, the transaction expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and interest expense associated with acquisitions can make our operating results from period to period difficult to compare. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our historical operating patterns will continue in future periods or that comparisons to prior periods will be meaningful.\nEconomic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control. Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals, and which may include the following:\n\uf0b7a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers\u2019 business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected;\n\uf0b7some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase;\n\uf0b7a significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers; and\n\uf0b7we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. In addition, we have other primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.\nHigher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenues.\nCarriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant, or to cover higher operating expenses. Our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. Increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing.\nWe face intense competition in the freight forwarding, freight brokerage, logistics and supply chain management industry.\nThe freight forwarding, freight brokerage, logistics and supply chain management industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We face competition from a number of companies, including many that have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Customers increasingly are turning to competitive bidding processes, in which they solicit bids from a number of competitors, including competitors that are larger than us. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following:\n\uf0b7competition with other transportation services companies, some of which have a broader coverage network, a wider range of services, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do;\n\uf0b7reduction by our competitors of their rates to gain business, especially during times of declining growth rates in the economy, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\uf0b7shift in the business of shippers to asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies\u2019 trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity;\n\uf0b7solicitation by shippers of bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors; and\n\uf0b7establishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs.\nOur industry is consolidating and if we cannot gain sufficient market presence, we may not be able to compete successfully against larger companies in our industry.\nThere currently is a trend within our industry towards consolidation of the niche players into larger companies that are attempting to increase global operations through the acquisition of regional and local freight forwarders, brokers, and other freight logistics providers. If we cannot gain sufficient market presence or otherwise establish a successful strategy in our industry, we may not be able to compete successfully against larger companies in our industry.\nIf we are not able to limit our liability for customers\u2019 claims for loss or damage to their goods through contract terms and limit our exposure through the purchase of insurance, we could be required to pay large amounts to our customers as compensation for their claims and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn our freight forwarding operations, we have liability under law to our customers for loss or damage to their goods. We attempt to limit our exposure through release limits, indemnification by the air, ocean, and ground carriers that transport the freight, and insurance. Moreover, because a freight forwarder relationship to an airline or ocean carrier is that of a shipper to a carrier, the airline or ocean carrier generally assumes the same responsibility to us as we assume to our customers. When we act in the capacity of an authorized agent for an air or ocean carrier, the carrier, rather than us, assumes liability for the safe delivery of the customer\u2019s cargo to its ultimate destination, unless due to our own errors and omissions. However, these efforts may prove unsuccessful and we may be liable for loss and damage to the goods.\nIn addition to legal liability, from time to time customers exert economic pressure when the underlying carrier fails to cover the costs of loss or damage. We have, from time to time, made payments to our customers for claims related to our services and may make such payments in the future. Should we experience an increase in the number or size of such claims or an increase in liability pursuant to claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims, our results could be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will provide us with adequate coverage for such claims or that the maximum amounts for which we are liable in connection with our services will not change in the future or exceed our insurance levels. As with every insurance policy, there are limits, exclusions and deductibles that apply, and we could be subject to claims for which insurance coverage may be inadequate or even disputed and such claims could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs could reduce our profitability.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from transportation of freight by the carriers with which we contract.\nWe use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in death or serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded from or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination.\nWe are subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.\nOur business exposes us to claims and litigation related to damage to cargo, labor and employment practices (including wage-and-hour, employment classification of independent contractor drivers, sales representatives, brokerage agents and other individuals, and other federal and state claims), personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters. We carry insurance to cover most exposures, subject to specific coverage exceptions, aggregate limits, and self-insured retentions that we negotiate from time to time. However, not all claims are covered, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, or involve significant aggregate use of our self-insured retention amounts, the expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the quarter in which the amounts are accrued. In addition, in the future, we may be subject to higher insurance premiums or increase our self-insured retention amounts, which could increase our overall costs or the volatility of claims expense.\nOur failure to comply with, or the costs of complying with, government regulation could negatively affect our results of operation.\nOur business is subject to evolving, complex and increasing regulation by national and international sources. Regulatory changes could affect the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of providing, services to customers. Future regulation and our failure to comply with any applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe motor carriers we contract with are subject to increasingly restrictive laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuture and existing environmental regulatory requirements could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. If we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand images and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the Radiant, Radiant Canada, Clipper, Airgroup, Adcom, DBA and Service by Air brands and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers. Service quality issues, actual or perceived, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other freight-forwarding companies. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.\nIssues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the user of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third-party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against us either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nWe also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third-parties or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Given our international operations, we seek to register our trademarks and other intellectual property domestically and internationally. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time consuming and costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\nOur failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe intend to grow rapidly and substantially, including by expanding our internal resources, by making acquisitions and entering into new markets. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets and change in revenue and business models.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will increase substantially as our operations grow. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, stock price and financial condition.\nOur loans and credit facilities contain financial covenants that may limit current availability and impose ongoing operational limitations and risk of compliance.\nWe currently maintain (i) a USD$150.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) with Bank of America Securities, Inc. as sole book runner and sole lead arranger, Bank of Montreal Chicago Branch, as lender and syndication agent, MUFG Union Bank, N.A as lender and documentation agent and Bank of America, N. A., KeyBank National Association and Washington Federal Bank, National Association as lenders (such named lenders are collectively referred to herein as \u201cLenders\u201d), pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of March 13, 2020, (ii) a CAD$29.0 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund IV LP (\u201cFPD IV\u201d formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund IV LP) pursuant to a CAD$29,000,000 Credit Facilities Loan Agreement (the \u201cFPD IV Loan Agreement\u201d), and (iii) a CAD$10.0 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund V LP (\u201cFPD V\u201d formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund V LP) pursuant to a CAD$10,000,000 Credit Facilities Loan Agreement (the \u201cFPD V Loan Agreement\u201d and, together with the FPD IV Loan Agreement, the \u201cFPD Loan Agreements\u201d). Repayment of the foregoing credit facilities is secured by our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries.\nFor general borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 and minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25. Additional minimum availability requirements and financial covenants apply in the event the Company seeks to use advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to pursue acquisitions or repurchase its common stock.\nOur compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities is particularly important given the materiality of such facilities to our day-to-day operations and overall acquisition strategy. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to secure a waiver or other relief, our financial condition would be materially weakened and our ability to fund day-to-day operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, we employ EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as management tools to measure our historical financial performance and as a benchmark for future financial flexibility.\nWe may operate with a significant amount of indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our assets and subject to variable interest rates and restrictive covenants.\nSubstantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, such as:\n\uf0b7require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness with our lenders, which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future operating capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\uf0b7expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\uf0b7require us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so;\n\uf0b7increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\uf0b7limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\uf0b7restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, buying assets or pursuing business opportunities; and\n\uf0b7limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, violating covenants in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consequences if the violations are not cured or waived could include substantially increasing our cost of borrowing, restricting our future operations, termination of our lenders\u2019 commitments to supply us with further funds, cross defaults to other obligations, or acceleration of our obligations. If some or all of our obligations are accelerated, we may not be able to fully repay them.\nDependence on key personnel.\nFor the foreseeable future, our success will depend largely on the continued services of our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bohn H. Crain, as well as certain of our other key executives and executives of our acquired businesses because of their collective industry knowledge, marketing skills and relationships with vendors, customers and strategic operating partners. Should any of these individuals leave us, we could have difficulty replacing them with qualified individuals and it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report). Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence, anti-terrorism measures or war may affect our operations and our profitability.\nAs a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our independent contractors and transportation providers or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. For example, security measures imposed at bridges, tunnels, border crossings and other points on key trucking routes may cause delays and increase the non-driving time of our independent contractors and transportation providers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We also have higher costs due to mandated security screening of air cargo traveling on passenger airlines and ocean freight. War, risk of war, or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nWe intend to continue growing our international operations and will become increasingly subject to variations in the international trade market.\nWe provide services to customers engaged in international commerce and intend to grow our international business in the coming years. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, international transportation revenue accounted for 43% and 40% of our net revenues, respectively. International transportation revenue is defined as any shipment with an initiation or destination point outside of the United States. All factors that affect international trade have the potential to expand or contract our international business and impact our operating results. For example, international trade is influenced by, among other things:\n\uf0b7currency exchange rates and currency control regulations;\n\uf0b7interest rate fluctuations;\n\uf0b7changes in governmental policies, such as taxation, quota restrictions, tariffs, other forms of trade barriers and/or restrictions and trade accords;\n\uf0b7changes in and application of international and domestic customs, trade and security regulations;\n\uf0b7wars, strikes, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts, such as the conflict that has led to the imposition of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union against Russia;\n\uf0b7natural disasters and pandemics;\n\uf0b7changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own;\n\uf0b7changes in availability of credit;\n\uf0b7economic conditions in other countries and regions;\n\uf0b7changes in supply chain design including those resulting from near shoring, widening and deepening of canals, and port congestion or disruption;\n\uf0b7changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products; and\n\uf0b7increased global concerns regarding environmental sustainability.\nIf any of the foregoing factors have a negative effect on the international trade market, we could suffer a decrease in our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our international business, we are subject to certain foreign regulatory requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could be detrimental to our business.\nWe provide services in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws, rules, regulations and decrees of the United States, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and of all other countries in which we conduct business; as well as trade control laws, or laws, regulations and Executive Orders imposing embargoes and sanctions; and anti-boycott laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees, subcontractors, consultants, agents, third-party brokers and customers, whose individual actions could violate these laws, rules, regulations and decrees. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties, damages to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business. In addition, any investigation or litigation related to such violations may require significant management time and could cause us to incur extensive legal and related costs, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nInternational operations expose us to currency exchange risk, and we cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operating results.\nWe generate a significant portion of revenues from our international operations, including a substantial amount in Canada. During the year ended June 30, 2021, approximately 43% of our net revenues were generated from international operations. Our international operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as well as intercompany transactions. Significant changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies in which we transact business and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have not entered into any hedging activities, and, to the extent that we continue not to do so in the future, we may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, our international operations also expose us to currency fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign operations to the U.S. dollar. There can be no guarantee that the effect of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results as well as our public reporting and stock price.\nWe have grown rapidly and face additional challenges of disparate systems and geographically dispersed management. Our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure are strained at times due to COVID-19, acquisitions, and other corporate development activities.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. As further described in Part II Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021 because of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to the following:\n(i)Our controls with respect to the recording and processing of revenue as currently designed lack the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenue.\n(ii)Our controls with respect to the calculation of operating partner commissions as currently designed lack the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of operating partner commissions.\nWe are currently working on the remediation of these material weaknesses.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Any remediation efforts additionally may require us to incur unanticipated costs for various professional fees and services. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Material inaccuracies in our financial statements would decrease the reliability of our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price.\nRisks related to our receipt of PPP funding.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on our current and future operations we applied for funds under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d). In April of 2020 we were approved for the amount of $5.9 million, which we received in May 2020. The PPP loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith, the certification does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In early 2020, the Small Business Administration provided guidance that it would be unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such company should be prepared to demonstrate to the Small Business Administration, upon request, the basis for its certification. Further, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Small Business Administration Administrator announced that the government will conduct a full audit of all PPP loans of more than $2 million for which the borrower applies for forgiveness. While we believe we have satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loans, there is a risk that we may be deemed to have been ineligible to receive the PPP loans or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP loans; we may be required to repay the PPP loans in their entirety and we could be subject to additional penalties. The Company applied for forgiveness during the year and received forgiveness during the current fiscal year.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition Strategy\nThere is a scarcity of and competition for acquisition opportunities.\nThere are a limited number of operating companies available for acquisition that we deem to be desirable targets. In addition, there is a very high level of competition among companies seeking to acquire these operating companies. We are and will continue to be a very minor participant in the business of seeking acquisitions of these types of companies. A large number of established and well-financed entities are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find to be desirable acquisition candidates. Many of these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us. Consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible acquisitions of these businesses. Even if we are able to successfully compete with these entities, this competition may affect the terms of completed transactions and, as a result, we may pay more or receive less favorable terms than we expected for potential acquisitions. We may not be able to identify operating companies that complement our strategy, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategy, we may be unable to complete an acquisition of such a company for many reasons, including:\n\uf0b7failure to agree on the terms necessary for a transaction, such as the purchase price;\n\uf0b7incompatibility between our operational strategies or management philosophies with those of the potential acquiree;\n\uf0b7competition from other acquirers of operating companies;\n\uf0b7lack of sufficient capital to acquire a profitable logistics company;\n\uf0b7unwillingness of a potential acquiree to agree to subordinate any future payment of earn-outs or promissory notes to the payments due to our lenders; and\n\uf0b7unwillingness of a potential acquiree to work with our management.\nRisks related to acquisition financing.\nWe have a limited amount of financial resources and our ability to make additional acquisitions without securing additional financing from outside sources is limited. In order to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy, we may be required to obtain additional financing. We may obtain such financing through a combination of traditional debt financing or the placement of debt and equity securities. We may finance some portion of our future acquisitions by either issuing equity or by using shares of our common stock for all or a portion of the purchase price for such businesses. In the event that our common stock does not attain or maintain a sufficient market value, or potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the purchase price for the sale of their businesses, we may be required to use more of our cash resources, if available, in order to maintain our acquisition program. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, we will not be able to complete acquisitions and our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. The terms of our credit facility require that we obtain the consent of our lenders prior to securing additional debt financing. There could be circumstances in which our ability to obtain additional debt financing could be constrained if we are unable to secure such consent.\nOur credit facilities place certain limits on the acquisitions we may make.\nUnder the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to obtain the consent of each of our lenders prior to making any additional acquisitions.\nWe are permitted to make additional acquisitions without the consent of the lenders only if certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions include the following: (i) no default shall have occurred or would result from such acquisition, (ii) the property acquired is used or useful in the same or a similar line of business as Radiant's, (iii) in the case of an acquisition of the equity interests, the board of directors of the target business shall have duly approved such Acquisition, (iv) we shall be in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to such acquisition and the consolidated leverage ratio shall be less than 3.25 to 1.00 for acquisitions valued above $25 million and 2.75 to 1.00 for any other acquisitions, (v) the representations and warranties made by Radiant in each loan document shall be true and correct, (vi) if such transaction involves the purchase of an interest in a partnership between Radiant as a general partner and entities unaffiliated with the borrower as the other partners, such transaction shall be effected by having such equity interest acquired by a corporate holding company directly or indirectly wholly owned by Radiant newly formed for the sole purpose of effecting such transaction, and (vii) immediately after giving effect to such acquisition, there shall be at least $25 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the event we are not able to satisfy the conditions of our credit facilities in connection with a proposed acquisition, we must either forego the acquisition, obtain the consent of the lenders, or retire the credit facility. This may prevent us from completing acquisitions that we determine are desirable from a business perspective and limit or slow our ability to achieve the critical mass we need to achieve our strategic objectives.\nTo the extent we make any material acquisitions, our earnings will be adversely affected by non-cash charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nUnder applicable accounting standards, purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration paid in a business combination to the identified acquired assets and liabilities based on their fair values at the time of acquisition. The excess of the consideration paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible assets acquired must be allocated among identifiable intangible assets including goodwill. The amount allocated to goodwill is not subject to amortization. However, it is tested at least annually for impairment. The amount allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and the like, is amortized over the life of these intangible assets. We expect that this will subject us to periodic charges against our earnings to the extent of the amortization incurred for that period. Because our business strategy focuses, in part, on growth through acquisitions, our future earnings will be subject to greater non-cash amortization charges than a company whose earnings are derived solely from organic growth. As a result, we will experience an increase in non-cash charges related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Our financial statements will show that our intangible assets are diminishing in value, even if the acquired businesses are increasing (or not diminishing) in value. Because of this discrepancy, we believe our EBITDA, a measure of financial performance that does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) of the United States, provides a meaningful measure of our financial performance. However, the investment community generally measures a public company\u2019s performance by its net income. Further, the financial covenants of our credit facility adjust EBITDA to exclude costs related to share-based compensation and other non-cash charges. Thus, we believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance. If the investment community elects to place more emphasis on net income, the future price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are not obligated to follow any particular criteria or standards for identifying acquisition candidates.\nOther than as required under the credit facility, we are not obligated to follow any particular operating, financial, geographic or other criteria in evaluating candidates for potential acquisitions or business combinations. We will determine the purchase price and other terms and conditions of acquisitions. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that our management team will use and consider in deciding whether or not to enter into a particular transaction.\nWe may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to successfully implement our acquisition strategy.\nSubject to the restrictions contained under our current credit facilities, we may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to complete future acquisitions. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of acquired businesses to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on the indebtedness, then we will be required to use our capital for such payments. This will restrict our ability to make additional acquisitions. We may also be forced to sell an acquired business in order to satisfy indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably once we incur this indebtedness or that we will be able to generate a sufficient amount of proceeds from the ultimate disposition of such acquired businesses to repay the indebtedness incurred to make these acquisitions.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel and assets of acquired businesses that may disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nA core component of our business plan is to acquire businesses and assets in the transportation and logistics industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. Such acquisitions also involve numerous operational risks, including:\n\uf0b7difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\uf0b7the diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\uf0b7the risk of entering new markets;\n\uf0b7the potential loss of existing or acquired strategic operating partners following an acquisition;\n\uf0b7the potential loss of key employees following an acquisition and the associated risk of competitive efforts from such departed personnel;\n\uf0b7possible legal disputes with the acquired company following an acquisition; and\n\uf0b7the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nAs a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute any acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.\nIn certain acquisitions, we may recognize non-cash gains or losses on changes in fair value of contingent consideration. We include contingent consideration based on future financial performance as a portion of the purchase price of certain acquisitions. To the extent that an acquired operation underperforms relative to anticipated earnings levels, we are able to set-off certain levels of future unpaid purchase price for such acquired operations. This will result in the recognition of a non-cash gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration. In the alternative, to the extent an acquired operation outperforms anticipated earnings levels, we will recognize a non-cash expense on the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These non-cash gains and expenses may have a material impact on our financial results, and the impact could be opposite to the underlying results of the acquired operation.\nNot every acquisition is structured utilizing contingent consideration. Our 2015 acquisitions of Radiant Canada and SBA and our 2017 acquisition of Lomas were structured without using contingent consideration. We will be unable to reduce the purchase price of these entities if they underperform relative to anticipated earnings levels.\nClaims against us or other liabilities we incur relating to any acquisition or business combination may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nThere may be liabilities we assume in any acquisition or business combination that we did not discover or underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence investigation. A seller will normally have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, but these obligations will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and a cap, as well as time limitations. There can be no assurance that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may face competition from parties who sell us their businesses and from professionals who cease working for us.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we generally obtain non-solicitation agreements from the professionals we hire, as well as non-competition agreements from senior managers and professionals. The agreements prohibit such individuals from competing with us during the term of their employment and for a fixed period afterwards and seeking to solicit our employees or clients. In some cases, but not all, we may obtain non-competition or non-solicitation agreements from parties who sell us their business or assets. Certain activities may be carved out of or otherwise may not be prohibited by these arrangements. We cannot assure that one or more of the parties from whom we acquire assets or a business or who do not join us or leave our employment will not compete with us or solicit our employees or clients in the future. Even if ultimately resolved in our favor, any litigation associated with the non-competition or non-solicitation agreements could be time consuming, costly and distract management\u2019s focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business. Moreover, states and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees.\nTherefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, we may not pursue legal remedies if we determine that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with the former employee or his clients, or other concerns, outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recourse or the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Such persons, because they have worked for us or a business that we acquire, may be able to compete more effectively with us, or be more successful in soliciting our employees and clients, than unaffiliated third parties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. The current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. Fluctuations may occur in response to the other risk factors listed in this prospectus supplement and for many other reasons, including:\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity, including those resulting from the seasonality of our business;\n\uf0b7our financial performance or the performance of our competitors and similar companies;\n\uf0b7the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\uf0b7changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\uf0b7failure to meet securities analysts\u2019 quarterly and annual projections;\n\uf0b7the impact of new federal or state regulations;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\uf0b7the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7the arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\uf0b7acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7technological innovations or other trends in our industry;\n\uf0b7news affecting our customers;\n\uf0b7operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\uf0b7regulatory or labor conditions applicable to us, our industry or the industries we serve;\n\uf0b7market conditions in our industry, the industries we serve, the financial markets and the economy as a whole;\n\uf0b7changes in our capital structure; and\n\uf0b7sales of our common stock by us or members of our management team.\nIn addition, the stock market historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock when you want or at attractive prices. In addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the Company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs or awards for legal damages, and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make a contested takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) could deter a change in our management or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of us, even if such a proposal is favored by a majority of our stockholders. For example, we are subject to the provisions of the DGCL that prohibit a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of such corporation\u2019s outstanding voting shares (an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d) for three years after the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Our certificate of incorporation provides that directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of 75% of our outstanding shares and that amendments to our bylaws require the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares. Our certificate of incorporation also includes undesignated preferred stock, which may enable our board of directors to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or otherwise. Finally, our bylaws include an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate directors or submit proposals at a stockholders meeting.\nOur Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a large portion of our common stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bohn H. Crain, beneficially owns approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2021. Accordingly, Mr. Crain can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Further, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders.\nTrading in our common stock has been limited.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NYSE American, it is traded not as frequently as compared to the volume of trading activity associated with larger companies whose shares trade on the larger national exchanges. Because of this limited liquidity, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares at the prices or volumes they desire. The trading price of our shares may from time to time fluctuate widely. The trading price may be affected by a number of factors including events described in the risk factors set forth in this report as well as our operating results, financial condition, announcements, general conditions in the industry and the financial markets, and other events or factors. In recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and smaller capitalization companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. In a volatile market, we may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe influx of additional shares of our common stock onto the market may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have completed many acquisitions that often include the issuance of additional shares pursuant to the purchase agreements. In addition, we may issue additional shares in connection with such acquisitions upon the achievement of certain earn-out thresholds or in connection with future acquisitions as part of the purchase consideration. The availability of additional shares for sale to the public under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and sale of such shares in public markets could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such an adverse effect on the market price would make it more difficult for us to sell our equity securities in the future at prices we deem appropriate or to use our shares as currency for future acquisitions, which will make it more difficult to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe issuance of additional shares may result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders.\nAt any time, we may make private offerings of our securities. We have issued, and may be required to issue, additional shares of common stock or common stock equivalents in payment of the purchase price of businesses we have acquired. This will have the effect of further increasing the number of shares outstanding. In connection with future acquisitions, we may undertake the issuance of more shares of common stock without notice to our then existing stockholders. We may also issue additional shares in order to, among other things, compensate employees or consultants or for other valid business reasons in the discretion of our board of directors, which could result in diluting the interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe exercise or conversion of our outstanding options, or other convertible securities or any derivative securities we issue in the future will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We are currently authorized to issue 100 million shares of common stock. As of September 1, 2021, we had 49,919,062 outstanding shares of common stock. As of September 1, 2021, we may in the future issue up to 1,412,889 additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of existing stock options.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms for those shares without the approval of our stockholders. Any such preferred stock we may issue in the future could rank ahead of our common stock in many ways, including in terms of dividends, liquidation rights, and voting rights.\nAs we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, investors in our shares of common stock will not receive any dividend income.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any dividends that we may pay in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on our future earnings, any applicable regulatory considerations, our financial requirements and other similarly unpredictable factors. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the terms of our credit facilities. Accordingly, investors seeking dividend income should not purchase our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our business or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 13196, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "RLGT"}
