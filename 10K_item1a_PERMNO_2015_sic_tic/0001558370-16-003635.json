{"cik": "1304421", "company": "Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition could intensify among our customer channels. The telecommunications, Internet and digital video businesses are highly competitive. We face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies, including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and resellers, wireless companies, Internet service providers, satellite companies, and cable television companies, and in some cases by new forms of providers who are able to offer competitive services through software applications, requiring a comparatively small initial investment. Due to consolidation and strategic alliances within the industry, we cannot predict the number of competitors we will face at any given time.\nThe wireless business has expanded significantly and has caused many subscribers with traditional telephone and land-based Internet access services to give up those services and to rely exclusively on wireless service. Consumers are finding individual television shows of interest to them through the Internet and are watching content that is downloaded to their computers. Some providers, including television and cable television content owners, have initiated what are called over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) services that deliver video content to televisions and computers over the Internet. OTT services can include episodes of highly-rated television series in their current broadcast seasons. They also can include content that is related to broadcast or sports content that we carry, but that is distinct and may be available only through the alternative source. Finally, the transition to digital broadcast television has allowed many consumers to obtain high-definition local broadcast television signals (including many network affiliates) over-the-air using a simple antenna. Consumers can pursue each of these options without foregoing any of the other options. We may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to many of these various competitive factors affecting the industry, including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently, new technologies, services and applications that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and discount or bundled pricing strategies by competitors. The incumbent telephone carrier in the markets we serve enjoys certain business advantages, including size, financial resources, favorable regulatory position, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers. The largest cable operators also enjoy certain business advantages, including size, financial resources,\nownership of or superior access to desirable programming and other content, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition and first-in-field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations. Our competitors continue to add features, increase data speeds and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services we offer. Their success in selling some services competitive with ours among our various customer channels can lead to revenue erosion in other related areas. We face intense competition in our markets for long-distance, Internet access, video service and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy. If we do not compete effectively we could lose customers, revenue and market share; customers may reduce their usage of our services or switch to a less profitable service; and we may need to lower our prices or increase our marketing efforts to remain competitive.\nWe must adapt to rapid technological change. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments, or if we adopt and implement them more slowly than our competitors, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services. Our industry operates in a technologically complex environment. New technologies are continually developed and products and services undergo constant improvement. Emerging technologies offer consumers a variety of choices for their communication and broadband needs. To remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and to introduce new or improved offerings that anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our various customer channels. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to match the benefits offered by competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, if we fail to employ technologies desired by our customers before our competitors do so or if we do not successfully execute on our technology initiatives.\nNew technologies, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, access and viewing of content, have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that will further increase the number of competitors that we face and drive changes in consumer behavior. Consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and are increasingly interested in communication services outside of the home and in newer services in wireless Internet technology and devices such as tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices. These new technologies, distribution platforms and consumer behaviors may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, evolving technologies can reduce the costs of entry for others, resulting in greater competition and significant new advantages to competitors. Technological developments could require us to make significant new capital investment in order to remain competitive with other service providers. If we do not replace or upgrade our network and its technology once it becomes obsolete, we will be unable to compete effectively and will likely lose customers. We also may be placed at a cost disadvantage in offering our services. Technology changes are also allowing individuals to bypass telephone companies and cable operators entirely to make and receive calls, and to provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming without the need to subscribe to traditional voice and video products and services. Increasingly, this can be done over wireless facilities and other emerging mobile technologies as well as traditional wired networks. Wireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies, which are capable of delivering high-speed Internet service via wireless technology to a large geographic footprint. As these technologies continue to expand in availability and reliability, they could become an effective alternative to our high-speed Internet services. Although we use fiber optics in parts of our networks, including in some residential areas, we continue to rely on coaxial cable and copper transport media to serve customers in many areas. The facilities we use to offer our video services, including the interfaces with customers, are undergoing a rapid evolution, and depend in part on the products, expertise and capabilities of third parties. If we cannot develop new services and products to keep pace with technological advances, or if such services and products are not widely embraced by our customers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nShifts in our product mix may result in declines in operating profitability. Margins vary among our products and services. Our profitability may be impacted by technological changes, customer demands, regulatory changes, the competitive nature of our business and changes in the product mix of our sales. These shifts may also result in our long-lived assets becoming impaired or our inventory becoming obsolete. We review long-lived assets for potential impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. We currently manage potential inventory obsolescence through reserves, but future technology changes may cause inventory obsolescence to exceed current reserves.\nVideo content costs are substantial and continue to increase. We expect video content costs to continue to be one of our largest operating costs associated with providing video service. Video programming content includes cable-oriented programming designed to be shown in linear channels, as well as the programming of local over-the-air television stations\nthat we retransmit. In addition, on-demand programming is being made available in response to customer demand. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced rapid increases in the cost of programming, especially the cost of sports programming and local broadcast station retransmission content. Programming costs are generally assessed on a per-subscriber basis, and therefore, are directly related to the number of subscribers to which the programming is provided. Our relatively small base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs. Larger providers can often qualify for discounts based on the number of their subscribers. This cost difference can cause us to experience reduced operating margins, while our competitors with a larger subscriber base may not experience similar margin compression. In addition, escalators in existing content agreements cause cost increases that are out of line with general inflation. While we expect these increases to continue, we may not be able to pass our programming cost increases on to our customers, particularly as an increasing amount of programming content becomes available via the Internet at little or no cost. Also, some competitors or their affiliates own programming in their own right and we may be unable to secure license rights to that programming. As our programming contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services packages and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe receive cash distributions from our wireless partnership interests and the continued receipt of future distributions is not guaranteed. We own five wireless partnership interests consisting of 2.34% of GTE Mobilnet of South Texas Limited Partnership, which provides cellular service in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas metropolitan areas; 3.60% of Pittsburgh SMSA Limited Partnership, which provides cellular service in and around the Pittsburgh metropolitan area; 20.51% of GTE Mobilnet of Texas RSA #17 Limited Partnership (\u201cRSA #17\u201d); 16.67% of Pennsylvania RSA 6(I) Limited Partnership (\u201cRSA 6(I)\u201d) and 23.67% of Pennsylvania RSA 6(II) Limited Partnership (\u201cRSA 6(II)\u201d). RSA #17 provides cellular service to a limited rural area in Texas. RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) provide cellular service in and around our Pennsylvania service territory.\nIn 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received cash distributions from these partnerships of $45.3 million, $34.6 million and $34.8 million, respectively. The cash distributions we receive from these partnerships are based on our percentage of ownership and the partnerships\u2019 operating results, cash availability and financing needs, as determined by the General Partner at the date of the distribution. We cannot control the timing, dollar amount or certainty of any future cash distributions from these partnerships. In the absence of the receipt of cash distributions from these partnerships, we may be unable to fulfill our long-term obligations or our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders may be restricted. If we do not receive cash distributions from these partnerships in the future, or if the amount of cash distributions decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA disruption in our networks and infrastructure could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses. Our customers depend on reliable service over our network. The primary risks to our network infrastructure include physical damage to lines, security breaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we will experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as physical damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and incur unexpected expenses.\nOur business may be harmed if we are unable to maintain data security. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes and systems. Any failure to maintain the security of our data and our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 confidential information, including the breach of our network security or the misappropriation of confidential information, could result in fines, penalties, litigation and loss of customers and revenues. Any such failure could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If we are unable to enter into new agreements or renew existing agreements before they expire, we could have a work stoppage or other labor actions that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services to our customers. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 28% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These employees are hourly workers located in Texas, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Illinois service territories and are represented by various unions and locals. Our relationship with these unions generally has been satisfactory, but occasional work stoppages can occur. All of the existing collective bargaining agreements expire between 2016 through 2018, of which one contract covering 9% of our employees will expire in 2016.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements, or the renewal of existing agreements, may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. While we believe our relations with the unions representing these employees are good, any protracted labor disputes or labor disruptions by any of our employees could have a significant negative effect on our financial results and operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support from third party vendors. We depend on third party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services and to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations and to support our information and billing systems. Some of our third-party vendors are our primary source of supply for products and services for which there are few substitutes. If any of these vendors should experience financial difficulties, have demand that exceeds their capacity or they cannot otherwise meet our specifications, our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected in which case our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of our certification or designation by key equipment manufacturers or business partners, or a partner losing its position as a leading provider of technology solutions would adversely impact our suite of business products and services. We provide various equipment solutions to our business customers. The equipment and product lines are provided by various manufacturers from which we also provide hardware and IT consulting solutions for our business customers. If our providers of equipment and certain technology solutions fall out of favor in the marketplace, our success as a distributor or implementer may decline or be delayed as we seek alternative providers. The loss of any special designations or authorizations may affect our success as a leading distributor. It is also possible that we may lose the certified technicians who build the basis for our qualifications.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain necessary rights-of-way for our network, our operations may be interrupted and we would likely face increased costs. We are dependent on easements, franchises and licenses from various private parties, such as established telephone companies and other utilities, railroads and long-distance companies, and from state highway authorities, local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space, underground conduits and other rights-of-way in order to construct and operate our networks. Some agreements relating to rights-of-way may be short-term or revocable at will, and we cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to existing rights-of-way after the governing agreements are terminated or expire. If any of our right-of-way agreements were terminated or could not be renewed, we may be forced to remove our network facilities from the affected areas, relocate or abandon our networks, which would interrupt our operations, force us to find alternative rights-of-way and make unexpected capital expenditures.\nOur ability to retain certain key management personnel and attract and retain highly qualified management and other personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business. We rely on the talents and efforts of key management personnel, many of whom have been with our company and in our industry for decades. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel and the ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel in the future could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions could be expensive and may not be successful. From time to time we make acquisitions and investments and enter into other strategic transactions. In connection with these types of transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses; fail to realize anticipated benefits; have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses; disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors; incur significant indebtedness or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Current Economic Conditions\nUnfavorable changes in financial markets could adversely affect pension plan investments resulting in material funding requirements to meet our pension obligations. We expect that we will continue to make future cash contributions\nto our pension plans, the amount and timing of which will depend on various factors including funding regulations, future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and mortality tables and changes in participant demographics. Unfavorable fluctuations or adverse changes in any of these factors, most of which are outside our control, could impact the funded status of the plans and increase future funding requirements. Returns generated on plan assets have historically funded a large portion of the benefits paid under these plans. If the financial markets experience a downturn and returns fall below the estimated long-term rate of return, our future funding requirements could increase significantly, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Downturns in the economic conditions in the markets and industries we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Economic weakness or uncertainty may make it difficult for us to obtain new customers and may cause our existing customers to reduce or discontinue their services to which they subscribe. This risk may be worsened by the expanded availability of free or lower cost services, such as video over the Internet, or substitute services, such as wireless phones and data devices. Weak economic conditions may also impact the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Payment of Dividends\nOur Board of Directors could, at its discretion, depart from or change our dividend policy at any time. Our Board of Directors maintains a current dividend practice for the payment of quarterly dividends at an annual rate of approximately $1.55 per share of common stock. We are not required to pay dividends and our stockholders do not have contractual or other legal rights to receive them. Our Board of Directors may decide at any time, in its discretion, to decrease the amount of dividends, change or revoke the dividend policy or discontinue paying dividends entirely. Our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, expected cash needs, debt covenant compliance and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. If we do not pay dividends, for whatever reason, shares of our common stock could become less liquid and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe might not have sufficient cash to maintain current dividend levels. Our debt agreements, applicable state, legal and corporate law, regulatory requirements and other risk factors described in this section, could materially reduce the cash available from operations or significantly increase our capital expenditure requirements, and these outcomes could cause funds not to be available when needed in an amount sufficient to support our current dividend practice.\nIf we continue to pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy, our ability to pursue growth opportunities may be limited. Our dividend practice could limit, but not preclude, our ability to grow. If we continue paying dividends at the level currently anticipated, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund a material expansion of our business, including any acquisitions or growth opportunities requiring significant and unexpected capital expenditures. For that reason, our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business may depend on our ability to obtain third-party financing. We cannot guarantee that such financing will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur organizational documents could limit or delay another party\u2019s ability to acquire us and, therefore, could deprive our investors of a possible takeover premium for their shares. A number of provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it difficult for another company to acquire us. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nDivide our Board of Directors into three classes, which results in roughly one-third of our directors being elected each year;\n\u00b7\nProvide that directors may only be removed for cause and then only upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock;\n\u00b7\nRequire the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock to amend, alter, change or repeal specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nRequire stockholders to provide us with advance notice if they wish to nominate any candidates for election to our Board of Directors or if they intend to propose any matters for consideration at an annual stockholders meeting; and\n\u00b7\nAuthorize the issuance of so-called \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nWe also are subject to laws that may have a similar effect. For example, federal, California, Illinois, Minnesota and Pennsylvania telecommunications laws and regulations generally prohibit a direct or indirect transfer of control over our business without prior regulatory approval. Similarly, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts our ability to engage in a business combination with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d. These laws and regulations make it difficult for another company to acquire us, and therefore, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Our Capital Structure\nWe have a substantial amount of debt outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could restrict our ability to pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,393.6 million of debt outstanding. Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely impact our business, including:\n\u00b7\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our debt, which will reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities, strategic initiatives and dividends;\n\u00b7\nWe may have limited flexibility to react to changes in our business and our industry;\n\u00b7\nIt may be more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations;\n\u00b7\nWe may have a limited ability to borrow additional funds or to sell assets to raise funds if needed for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u00b7\nWe may become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates; and\n\u00b7\nWe may be at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenues to service our debt and have adequate funds left over to achieve or sustain profitability in our operations, meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, compete successfully in our markets, or pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur credit agreement and the indentures governing our 2022 Notes contain covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from capitalizing on opportunities and taking other corporate actions. Among other things, our credit agreement limits or restricts our ability (and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries), and the separate indentures governing the 2022 Notes limit the ability of our subsidiary, Consolidated Communications, Inc., and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; make restricted payments, including paying dividends on, redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock; make investments and prepay or redeem debt; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer assets to us; create liens; sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of, or other ownership interests in subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; engage in sale and leaseback transactions; engage in a business other than telecommunications; and consolidate or merge.\nIn addition, our credit agreement requires us to comply with specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding total leverage and interest coverage. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise constrain our activities or business plans. They also may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement, in any future credit agreement, or in the separate indentures governing the 2022 Notes, or our inability to comply with the financial ratios could result in an event of default, which would allow the lenders to declare all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable. If the amounts outstanding under our credit facilities were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed. In such a situation, the lenders could foreclose on the assets and capital stock pledged to them.\nWe may not be able to refinance our existing debt if necessary, or we may only be able to do so at a higher interest expense. We may be unable to refinance or renew our credit facilities and our failure to repay all amounts due on the maturity dates would cause a default under the credit agreement. Alternatively, any renewal or refinancing may occur on less favorable terms. If we refinance our credit facilities on terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of our existing debt, our interest expense may increase significantly, which could impact our results of operations and impair our ability to use our funds for other purposes, such as to pay dividends.\nOur variable-rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk, which could impact our cost of borrowing and operating results. Certain of our debt obligations are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations and operating cash flows. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. However, we do not maintain interest rate hedging agreements for all of our variable-rate debt and our existing hedging agreements may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks. Changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that have been de-designated or determined to be ineffective are recognized in earnings. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value of these cash flow hedges could cause favorable or adverse fluctuations in our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Business\nWe are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment, and we face compliance costs and restrictions greater than those of many of our competitors. Our businesses are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and other federal, state and local entities. Rapid changes in technology and market conditions have resulted in changes in how the government addresses telecommunications, video programming and Internet services. Many businesses that compete with our Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (\u201cILEC\u201d) and non-ILEC subsidiaries are comparatively less regulated. Some of our competitors are either not subject to utilities regulation or are subject to significantly fewer regulations. In contrast to our subsidiaries regulated as cable operators and satellite video providers, competing on-demand and OTT providers and motion picture and DVD firms have almost no regulation of their video activities. Recently, federal and state authorities have become more active in seeking to address critical issues in each of our product and service markets. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state levels, could require significant and costly adjustments that would adversely affect our business plans. New regulations could impose additional costs or capital requirements, require new reporting, impair revenue opportunities, potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to our customers and us and potentially create barriers to enter new markets or to acquire new lines of business. We face continued regulatory uncertainty in the immediate future. Not only are these governmental entities continuing to move forward on these matters, their actions remain subject to reconsideration, appeal and legislative modification over an extended period of time, and it is unclear how their actions will ultimately impact our markets. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes may have on us.\nWe receive support from various funds established under federal and state laws, and the continued receipt of that support is not assured. A significant portion of our revenues come from network access and subsidies. An order adopted by the FCC in 2011 (the \u201cOrder\u201d) significantly impacts the amount of support revenue we receive from the Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d), Connect America Fund (\u201cCAF\u201d) and intercarrier compensation (\u201cICC\u201d). The Order reformed core parts of the USF, broadly recast the existing ICC scheme, established the CAF to replace support revenues provided by the current USF and redirected support from voice services to broadband services. In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services.\nIn December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances in which their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding. If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF Phase II funding begins immediately. We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015. The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a three year period, beginning in\nAugust 2015, at the rates of 75% of the CAF Phase I funding level in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year.\nThe Order also modifies the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period. As a result of implementing the provisions of the Order, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015. We anticipate that network access revenue will continue to decline as a result of the Order through 2018 by as much as $1.9 million, $4.8 million and $6.8 million in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nWe receive subsidy payments from various federal and state universal service support programs, including high-cost support, Lifeline and E-Rate programs for schools and libraries. The total cost of the various federal universal service programs has increased significantly in recent years, putting pressure on regulators to reform the programs and to limit both eligibility and support. We cannot predict when or how such matters will be decided or the effect on the subsidy payments we receive. However, future reductions in the subsidy payments we receive may directly affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of the Internet could increase our cost of doing business. Current laws and regulations governing access to, or commerce on, the Internet are limited. As the Internet continues to become more significant, federal, state and local governments may adopt new rules and regulations applicable to, or apply existing laws and regulations to, the Internet. At the federal level, the FCC intends to reclassify broadband Internet services as a telecommunications service subject to regulation under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and in March 2015, the FCC released its net neutrality order, which applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband Internet services. The net neutrality order addresses several areas that will be regulated and others that are subject to forbearance. The regulations disallow blocking, throttling and paid prioritization by Internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers regarding rates, fees, data allowances and packet loss. Finally, it gives the FCC codified enforcement authority and it forbears on certain Title II regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety. Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability in connection with the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, asbestos and petroleum products. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing air emissions from our fleet vehicles. As a result, we face several risks, including:\n\u00b7\nHazardous materials may have been released at properties that we currently own or formerly owned (perhaps through our predecessors). Under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable, without regard to fault, for the costs of investigating and remediating any actual or threatened contamination at these properties and for contamination associated with disposal by us, or by our predecessors, of hazardous materials at third-party disposal sites.\n\u00b7\nWe could incur substantial costs in the future if we acquire businesses or properties subject to environmental requirements or affected by environmental contamination. In particular, environmental laws regulating wetlands, endangered species and other land use and natural resources may increase the costs associated with future business or expansion or delay, alter or interfere with such plans.\n\u00b7\nThe presence of contamination can adversely affect the value of our properties and make it difficult to sell any affected property or to use it as collateral.\n\u00b7\nWe could be held responsible for third-party property damage claims, personal injury claims or natural resource damage claims relating to contamination found at any of our current or past properties.\nThe cost of complying with environmental requirements could be significant. Similarly, the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretations, could result in significant compliance costs or unanticipated environmental liabilities.", "PERMNO": 90803, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CNSL"}
