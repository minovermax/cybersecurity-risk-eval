{"cik": "880984", "company": "ACORN ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward-looking information. However, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections. The following risks and uncertainties, together with other factors not presently determinable, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections.\nGENERAL FACTORS\nWe have a history of operating losses and have used significant amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments.\nWe have a history of losses from our OmniMetrix subsidiary and corporate overhead, and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years. In 2017 and 2016, we had operating losses of $1.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively. We also had income from discontinued operation of $0.7 million in 2017 and a loss from discontinued operations of $0.3 million in 2016. Cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in 2017 was $1.6 million and $3.6 million in 2016. An additional $1.0 million were used in the operating activities of discontinued operations in 2016.\nThe closing of the 2018 DSIT Transaction (see Recent Developments) provided us with approximately $1.9 million after paying transaction costs, withholding taxes and the repayment of director loans and associated accrued interest. On March 16, 2018, we had approximately $2.4 million of corporate cash and cash equivalents.\nDuring 2017, we provided OmniMetrix with $300,000 of financing during 2017 and none since September of 2017. We believe that with OmniMetrix\u2019s continued growth and increased credit availability, that OmniMetrix will not need financing from us during 2018. Our corporate overhead has also been significantly reduced and has stabilized, though we continue to look for cost savings. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient cash to finance our operations for at least twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, we may need to seek additional sources of funding for long-term corporate costs or if OmniMetrix were not to grow at the rate anticipated and needed additional funds for their operations. Additional sources of funding may include additional loans from related and/or non-related parties, partial sale or finding a strategic partner for OmniMetrix or equity financings. There can be no assurance additional funding will be available at acceptable terms or that we will be able to successfully utilize any of these possible sources to provide additional liquidity.\nWe depend on key management for the success of our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team, including Jan Loeb and Walter Czarnecki. The loss of the services of any of these key managers could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of these employees. We may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management if their services were no longer available.\nLoss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations.\nWe depend on key technical employees and sales personnel. The loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers. The loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules. The loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers. Although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non-competition agreements, the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. If we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, our business could be disrupted.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be volatile\nOur common stock is approved for quotation on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cACFN.\u201d The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter equity securities and provides significantly less liquidity than a listing on the NASDAQ Stock Markets or other national securities exchanges. The OTCQB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common stock. Quotes for stocks included on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the NASDAQ Stock Market or the NYSE. Therefore, prices for securities traded solely on the OTCQB may be difficult to obtain.\nTrading on the OTCQB marketplace as opposed to a national securities exchange has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our company:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common stock;\n\u25cf the market price of shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of market markers in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and\n\u25cf the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or services by us;\n\u25cf fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf significant sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; and\n\u25cf news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.\nPenny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their stock\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations.\nKeeping informed of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting standards, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, as well as new and proposed SEC regulations and accounting standards, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. Compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nPart of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies or complimentary companies. Although we do not presently foresee making such acquisitions in the near term unless they support our existing business, if we did so, any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition\u2019s management into our controls, systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order to grow, we may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions, although we do not currently plan any significant acquisitions. Any significant acquisition could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing. We anticipate the need to closely manage our cash for the foreseeable future and cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nIntegrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences. Integrating acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;\n\u25cf inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf dilution of existing stockholders;\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management;\n\u25cf difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies, sales and marketing, and research and development efforts; and\n\u25cf difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities. We expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations, we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs. We continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel, but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWe may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Any legal proceedings can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe have reported material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future or that we can effectively remediate our reported weaknesses. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nAs a result, we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future or that we can effectively remediate our reported weaknesses. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful, others may duplicate our technology.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, systems designs and manufacturing processes. The ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage. In the future, should we apply for new patents, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or, in the case of patents issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes. Further, a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas. Even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. These actions could place our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products, systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends. Furthermore, it is not practical from a cost/benefit perspective to file for patent or trademark protection in every jurisdiction where we now or in the future may conduct business. In those territories where we do not have the benefit of patent or trademark protections, our competitors may be able to prevent us from selling our products or otherwise limit our ability to advertise under our established product names and we may face risks associated with infringement litigation as discussed below.\nWe rely, to a significant degree, on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. These trade secrets either cannot be protected by patent protection or we have determined that seeking a patent is not in our interest. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors.\nIt can be difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.\nAs part of our business operations, we maintain insurance as a corporate risk management strategy. Insurance products are impacted by market fluctuations and can become expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain. There can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance at an affordable price for the required limits. Our failure to obtain such insurance could lead to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or cause us to be out of compliance with our contractual obligations.\nWe may in the future be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company. While insurance can mitigate some of this risk, due to our current size and limited operating history, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance with significant coverage. Our customers may not accept the terms we have been able to procure and seek to terminate our existing contracts or cease to do business with us.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were deposited primarily with U.S. banks and brokerage firms and amounted to $481,000 at December 31, 2017. The Company does not believe there is significant risk of non-performance by these counterparties. Approximately 27% of the accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 was due from one customer who pay their receivables over usual credit periods. Credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company\u2019s customer base.\nRISKS RELATED TO OMNIMETRIX\nOmniMetrix has incurred net losses since our acquisition and may never achieve sustained profitability.\nOmniMetrix has generated losses since our acquisition in 2012 including losses of $0.8 million in 2017 and $1.2 million in 2016. While OmniMetrix has significantly reduced its losses and its cash needs from us, particularly since the latter half of 2017 (OmniMetrix has not needed funding from us since September 2017), we can provide no assurance that OmniMetrix will be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to eventually sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows.\nAn increase in customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing OmniMetrix revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nNon-renewals or other monitoring service terminations could increase in the future due to customer dissatisfaction with our products and services, increased competition from other providers or alternative technologies.\nIf we have an increase in our non-renewal rate, we will have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers, our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be affected.\nOmniMetrix is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.\nSome of OmniMetrix\u2019s current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with OmniMetrix\u2019s existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. In particular at the present time we are facing significant competition from generator manufacturers who offer their own monitoring solutions.\nOmniMetrix may not be able to access sufficient capital to support growth.\nOmniMetrix has been dependent on Acorn\u2019s ability and willingness to provide funding to support its business and growth strategy. Since our acquisition of OmniMetrix in February 2012, we invested approximately $14.0 million and through March 16, 2018 have lent $2,662,000 net of repayments to OmniMetrix. OmniMetrix has reduced its borrowings from Acorn (only $300,000 in 2017) and has not borrowed from Acorn since September 2017 and is not expected to need working capital support from us in 2018 to support its growth and working capital needs.\nIn October 2017, OmniMetrix renewed its Loan and Security Agreement providing OmniMetrix with access to accounts receivable formula-based financing of the lesser of 75% of eligible receivables or $1 million. Debt incurred under this financing arrangement bears interest at the greater of prime (4.50% at December 31, 2017) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition, OmniMetrix is to pay a monthly service charge of 0.9% of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month, for a current effective rate of interest on advances of 17.3%. OmniMetrix also agreed to continue to maintain a minimum loan balance of $150,000 in its line-of-credit with the lender for a minimum of one year beginning November 1, 2017.\nWe have no assurance that this financing arrangement will provide sufficient liquidity for OmniMetrix\u2019s working capital needs in 2018. Additional financing for OmniMetrix may be in the form of a bank line, a new loan or investment by others, a loan by Acorn, or a combination of the above. The availability and amount of any additional loans from us to OmniMetrix may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities. Whether Acorn will have the resources necessary to provide funding, or whether alternative funds, such as third-party loans, will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to Acorn and OmniMetrix cannot be determined.\nOmniMetrix sells equipment and services which monitor third-party products, thus its revenues are dependent on the continued sales of such third-party products.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s end-user customer base is comprised exclusively of parties who have chosen to purchase either generators or construct gas pipelines. OmniMetrix has no ability to control the rate at which new generators or cathodic protection systems are acquired. When purchases of such products decline, the associated need for OmniMetrix\u2019s products and services is expected to decline as well.\nIf OmniMetrix is unable to keep pace with changing market or customer-mandated product and service improvements, OmniMetrix\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nMany of OmniMetrix\u2019s existing products may require ongoing engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs. There can be no assurance that OmniMetrix will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cellular networks used by OmniMetrix are also subject to periodic technical updates that may require corresponding updates to, or replacement of, OmniMetrix\u2019s monitoring equipment.\nCellular networks have evolved over time to offer more robust technical capabilities in both voice and data transmission. At the present time, the changes from the so-called \u201c2G\u201d to \u201c3G\u201d and \u201c4G\u201d service have resulted in only limited service interruptions. OmniMetrix anticipates, however, that as these new capabilities come online, it will be necessary to have equipment that can readily interface with the newer cellular networks to avoid negative impacts on customer service. Not all of the costs associated with OmniMetrix\u2019s corresponding equipment upgrades can be passed on to customers and the increased expenses are expected to have a negative impact on OmniMetrix\u2019s operating results.\nA substantial portion of OmniMetrix\u2019s revenues are expected to be generated not from product sales, but from periodic monitoring fees and thus it is continually exposed to risks associated with its customers\u2019 financial stability.\nOmniMetrix sells on-going monitoring services to both PG and CP customers. It is therefore dependent on these customers continuing to timely pay service fees on an on-going basis. If a significant portion of these fees are not renewed from year-to-year, OmniMetrix can expect to experience deterioration in its financial condition.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s ability to provide, and to collect revenues from, monitoring services is dependent on the reliability of cellular networks not controlled by OmniMetrix.\nOmniMetrix provides monitoring services through the use of cellular technology utilizing the networks of third-party providers. These providers generally do not warrant their services to either OmniMetrix or the end users and any dropped transmissions could result in the loss of customer renewals and potential claims against OmniMetrix. While OmniMetrix uses contractual measures to limit its liability to customers, there is no assurance that such limitations will be enforced or that customers will not cancel monitoring services due to network issues.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to reliably store and manage data, but there can be no guarantee that it has sufficient capabilities to mitigate potential data loss in all cases.\nThe efficient operation of OmniMetrix\u2019s business is dependent on its information technology systems. In addition, OmniMetrix\u2019s ability to assist customers in analyzing data related to the performance of such customers\u2019 power and cathodic protection monitoring systems is an important component of its customer value proposition. OmniMetrix utilizes off-site data servers, housed within a commercial data center utilizing accepted data and power monitoring and protection processes, but whether a data loss can be avoided cannot be assured in every case. OmniMetrix\u2019s information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, sabotage (including theft and attacks by computer viruses or hackers), power outages; and computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure. Any interruption of OmniMetrix\u2019s information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur stock price is highly volatile and we do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Investors may never obtain a return on their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. During 2017, our common stock traded at prices as low as $0.15 and as high as $0.56 per share. Fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including:\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address;\n\u25cf quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf strategic investments or divestments;\n\u25cf announcements of changes in our senior management;\n\u25cf the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers or us;\n\u25cf the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets;\n\u25cf changes in accounting rules;\n\u25cf changes in investor perceptions; or\n\u25cf changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and expansion of our business. Accordingly, you will need to rely on sales of your common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on your investment\nOur share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options.\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are, or could upon exercise of options or warrants become eligible for sale in the public market as described below. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect our stock price.\nAs of March 16, 2018, 29,518,830 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. As of that date we had 2,654,423 warrants outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $1.46 and 1,400,655 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.45 per share, which if exercised would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock. In addition to the options noted above, at March 16, 2018, 53,334 options are outstanding, but have not yet vested and are not yet exercisable.\nSubstantially all of our currently outstanding shares and shares issuable under our outstanding options and warrants are or would be freely tradable.\nWe may have to offer additional securities for sale in the near future.\nIn February 2018, we sold of our remaining interest in DSIT (see Recent Developments) and received cash proceeds of approximately $4.2 million (net of our balance due to Acorn which was assigned to the purchasers) which was used to pay transaction costs, withholding taxes, repay our director loans and associated accrued interest and provide working capital for us and if necessary, OmniMetrix. As of March 16, 2018, we had corporate cash of approximately $2.4 million which we believe is sufficient for at least the next twelve months. Despite this, we may ultimately not have sufficient cash to allow us to execute our plans and the occurrence of one or more unanticipated events may require us to make significant expenditures. Accordingly, we may need to raise additional amounts to finance our operations. If we were to do so by selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock, current investors will incur additional dilution in the value of their shares.", "PERMNO": 77327, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "ACFN"}
