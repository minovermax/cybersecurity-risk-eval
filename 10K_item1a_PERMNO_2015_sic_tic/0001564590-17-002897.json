RISK FACTORS\nOur consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks related to our business\nGlobal market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on customers\u2019 businesses, could adversely affect the Company.\nIn general, demand for our products and services is highly correlated with general economic conditions. Because a significant part of our business relies on our customers\u2019 advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and consumer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for printing and related services that we provide to these customers. Delays or reductions in customers\u2019 spending would have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could be material, and consequently could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased revenue, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable.\nIn addition, customer difficulties could result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. We may experience operating margin declines as a result. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.\nUncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Such declines in demand are difficult to predict and may result in the Company or the industry having increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity may result in declines in prices for our products and services. The overall business climate may also be impacted by wars or acts of terrorism. Such acts may have sudden and unpredictable adverse impacts on demand for our products and services.\nOur operations are subject to political and regulatory risks in the countries in which we operate.\nOur operations could be substantially affected by both domestic and international economic, political or regulatory risk including: general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate; unexpected legal, regulatory or tax changes; governmental actions which have the effect of restriction on our business or opportunities or make it more expensive for us to operate in those jurisdictions; and changes in tax laws that could reduce net income due to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions.\nIn addition, potential political and economic uncertainty in our developed markets, including recent outcomes of the United Kingdom referendum to withdraw from the European Union and the U.S. presidential election, or the perception of such uncertainty, has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. This may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks associated with our domestic and international operations.\nOur business is dependent upon brand reputation and the quality of our customer support and services offerings. If we fail to offer effective customer support and services, our brand reputation would be harmed and customers may not use our solutions, resulting in a decline of our net sales.\nA high level of customer support and service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions and the maintenance and enhancement of our brand reputation. If we are unable to provide a level of customer support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience a loss of customers and market share and a decline in our brand reputation which may result in reduced customer demand for our solutions. Furthermore, our brand reputation could be impacted by a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including actions of our competitors and third party providers and positive or negative publicity.\nDuring 2016, our five largest customers accounted for less than 10% of our net sales. In addition, we continue to provide products and services, including logistics, pre-media, production and sales services, to LSC and Donnelley Financial and their respective customers. There can be no assurance that our customers, including LSC and Donnelley Financial, will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of, or disruptions related to, significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to significant customers. This could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, disputes with significant suppliers, including those related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer preferences have reduced, and may continue to reduce, demand for our products in certain markets. In addition, failure to manage changes in our relationships with our significant customers will have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMany of the end markets in which our customers compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of customers. If we are unable to continue to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments and changing demands of customers may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies. We must monitor changes in our customers\u2019 markets and develop new solutions to meet customers\u2019 needs. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers. If we are unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, customers\u2019 demand for our products and services may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, electronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents. Consumers continue to accept electronic substitution in statement printing and forms while online and digital advertising is impacting customers\u2019 printed advertising spends. The extent to which consumers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future rates of acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has negatively impacted our products, such as forms and statement printing. To the extent that consumers, customers and regulators continue to accept these alternatives, our products will be adversely affected.\nFinally, there can be no assurance that our customers, including LSC and Donnelley Financial (both of which we spun off in October 2016 and who continue to be our customers), will continue to purchase our products in the same mix, quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to our significant customers. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse credit market conditions, our operating performance and our creditworthiness may limit our ability to obtain future financing and the cost of any such capital may be higher than in past periods.\nUncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial institutions to fail, may cause lenders to reduce lending or may cause investors to reinvest in assets that are considered less risky. The failure of a financial institution that supports our existing credit agreement would reduce the size of its committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. Furthermore, we revised our existing financing structure to consummate the spinoff transactions, through refinancing and debt tender and exchange transactions. Any future capital markets transactions will be dependent on market conditions, which may result in receiving financing on terms less favorable to us than our existing financings.\nIn addition, our access to future financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and credit capacity at the time we pursue such financing. Our current corporate credit ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our borrowing costs may further increase and our ability to borrow may be limited. Our obligations under our current $800.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) which expires September 30, 2021, are guaranteed by material and certain other domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including most of our domestic subsidiaries, and a security interest in substantially all of the domestic current assets and mortgages of certain domestic real property of the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement is subject to a number of covenants, including a maximum Leverage Ratio that, in part, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments, dispose of certain assets and may also limit the use of proceeds. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $60.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. If adequate capital is not available to us and our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, or if future financings require more restrictive covenants, such combination of events could adversely affect our ability to (i) acquire new businesses or enter new markets, (ii) service or refinance our existing debt, (iii) pay dividends on common stock, (iv) make necessary capital investments, and (v) make other expenditures necessary for the ongoing conduct of our business.\nWe may not be able to reduce or extinguish any of our material indebtedness, and as a result we would have increased financial leverage, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to reduce or extinguish any of our material indebtedness. We have substantial indebtedness and if we are unable to reduce this indebtedness, we will continue to have increased financial leverage. Our interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness have increased substantially in relation to our revenues and cash flows. In addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance.\nThe indentures governing the notes and debentures we issue do not contain restrictive covenants and we may incur substantially more debt or take other actions, including engaging in mergers and acquisitions, paying dividends and making other distributions to holders of equity securities, and disposing of certain assets, which may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes and debentures issued under our indentures.\nAlthough the Credit Agreement is subject to a number of negative and financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, and covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers and acquisitions, pay dividends and make other distributions to the holders of our equity securities, and dispose of certain assets, the indentures governing our outstanding notes and debentures do not contain financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, the payment of dividends or making other distributions, or the disposition of certain assets. In addition, the limited covenants applicable to the notes and debentures do not require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations.\nIn carrying out our strategy focused on maximizing long-term stockholder value, we may enter into transactions which may increase our financial leverage. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing our notes and debentures could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on those notes and debentures when due, and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials or by fluctuations in the costs of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support our operations. As such, purchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase our costs and we may not be able to pass these costs on to customers through higher prices. In addition, we may not be able to resell waste paper and other print-related by-products or may be adversely impacted by decreases in the prices for these by-products. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely impact customers\u2019 demand for our printing and related services. Unforeseen developments in these markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials and could cause a decline in our revenues.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology.\nWe have in the past acquired, and intend in the future to acquire, other businesses, and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of our key personnel or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt our operations or the operations of the acquired businesses. Our strategy is, in part, predicated on our ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, we may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nThe highly competitive market for our products and industry consolidation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe markets for the majority of our product categories are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors. Management believes that excess capacity in our markets has caused downward price pressure and that this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which we compete may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices.\nWe believe that selectively pursuing acquisitions is an important strategy for our business. If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another or otherwise consolidate, the competitive landscape we face could be significantly altered. Such consolidation could create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and, if we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the resulting increase in competitive pressures could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees and retirees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to both employees and retirees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. due to anticipated policy decisions of the new presidential administration may also increase our cost of providing such benefits.\nChanges in market conditions or lower returns on assets may increase required pension and other postretirement benefits plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefits plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions have increased the level of expected required pension and other postretirement benefits plan contributions in future years. Market conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate or worsen the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse market conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension and other postretirement benefits plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nCatastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events could cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our customers, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature could also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and from performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nWe may be more vulnerable to adverse events and trends associated with operations outside the United States.\nAs a result of the spinoff transactions, our business is less diversified. In addition, we have significant operations outside the United States. Consequently, we may be more exposed to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States. Conducting business outside the United States subjects us to a number of additional risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nperiodic changes in a specific country's or region's economic conditions, such as recession;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations (including those of municipalities or provinces where we have operations) and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, social insurance contributions and other payroll taxes and fees to governmental entities, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses;\n\u2022\ncertification requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those resulting from inflation, and currency devaluation activities;\n\u2022\ninadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npotential political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts, and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are located;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas and cultures, including assuring compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U. S. and foreign anticorruption laws; and;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.\nThese factors, individually or in combination, could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products, result in unexpected and material expenses, or cause an unexpected decline in the demand for our products in certain countries or regions. Specifically with respect to our operations in China, our financial performance may be subject to the following risks, among others: regulation of foreign investment and business activities by the Chinese government, including recent scrutiny of foreign companies, may limit our ability to expand our business in China; uncertainties with respect to the legal system in China may limit the legal protections available to us in China; government restrictions on the remittance of currency out of China and the ability of any subsidiary we may establish in China to pay dividends and make other distributions to us; and potential unfavorable tax consequences as a result of our operations in China. Our failure to manage the risks and challenges associated with our international business and operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into our consolidated financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, revenues and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, we may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. We cannot be sure, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses that are material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nA decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.\nWe hold material amounts of goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write down or write off these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChanges in the rules and regulations to which we are subject may increase our costs.\nWe are subject to numerous rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, product safety, environmental and health and welfare benefit regulations. These rules and regulations may be changed by local, state or federal governments in countries in which we operate. Changes in these regulations may result in a significant increase in our costs to comply. Compliance with changes in rules and regulations could require increases to our workforce, increased cost for compensation and benefits, or investments in new or upgraded equipment. In addition, growing concerns about climate change, including the impact of global warming, may result in new regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation. Compliance with new rules and regulations or changes in existing rules and regulations could result in additional costs.\nChanges in the rules and regulations to which customers are subject may impact demand for our products and services.\nMany of our customers are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications, governing the form of such communications and protecting the privacy of consumers. For instance, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to such regulations. Changes in these regulations may impact customers\u2019 business practices and could reduce demand for our products and services. Changes in such regulations could eliminate the need for certain types of communications altogether or such changes may impact the quantity or format of such communications.\nChanges in postal rates, regulations and delivery structure may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customers\u2019 cost structure and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces and types of mailings that our customers mail. On December 24, 2013, the Postal Regulatory Commission (the \u201cPRC\u201d) approved the USPS Board of Governors\u2019 request for an exigent price increase of 4.3%. This exigent rate increase was implemented in addition to a 1.7% rate increase, equal to the CPI, for total price increases of 6.0%, on average, across all mail categories, effective January 26, 2014. On January 15, 2015, the USPS filed for a CPI rate increase of approximately 2.0%, which was approved by the PRC on May 7, 2015, and became effective May 31, 2015. The USPS eliminated the 4.3% exigent rate increase in April 2016. The USPS implemented a CPI postage increase on January 22, 2017 of approximately 1.0%. In addition, the USPS has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may, as a result, implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery. The USPS has temporarily suspended its previously announced plans to restructure its mail delivery network, including the closure of many post office facilities. The impact of the USPS\u2019s restructuring plans, many of which require legislative action, cannot currently be estimated. If implemented, such changes could impact our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to communicate by mail. Declines in print volumes mailed would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies to deliver the products we create for our customers, and as part of our logistics business for our customers, changes in our relationships with these companies or an increase in shipping costs could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely upon third party carriers, including FedEx and UPS, for timely delivery of our product shipments. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and increased fuel costs. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers. If our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to ship products for us, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers for the shipment of products to our customers. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or\non terms favorable to us, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, shipping costs represent a significant operational expense for us. Changes in shipping terms, or the inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively (whether as a result of mechanical failure, casualty loss, labor stoppage, or any other reason), could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our carriers could have an adverse impact on our shipping costs. Any future increases in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers.\nUndetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.\nOur products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platform are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, customer dissatisfaction and reductions in net sales and margins, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nOur services depend on the reliability of computer systems we and our vendors maintain and the ability to implement and maintain information technology and security measures to protect against security breaches and data leakage. Our failure to maintain the integrity of these systems could compromise the confidentiality of certain information provided to us by our customers and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business.\nWe depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems, or a security breach or a data leak that compromises the confidential and sensitive information stored in those systems, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our ability to compete. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage and power outages and are also susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency.\nMaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our customers and users who rely on us to protect the confidentiality of certain information they provide us. Many of our customers\u2019 industries are highly regulated and have established standards and requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers. Disclosure of the information maintained on our systems due to human error, breach of our systems through hacking or cybercrime, a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or otherwise could materially damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory risks and cause significant reputational harm for our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spinoffs may not achieve the intended results.\nOur operational and financial profile changed upon the separation of LSC and Donnelley Financial from the Company\u2019s other businesses. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources diminished, and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of our business in the multichannel communications management industry. Further, shares of our common stock represent an investment in a smaller company. These changes may not meet some stockholders\u2019 investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Excessive selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease.\nFurther, the anticipated benefits of the spinoff transactions were based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. Any such incorrect assumptions could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile we believe that the spinoff transactions will result in a number of benefits to us, including, among others, enabling management to better focus on our multichannel integrated communications business, if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction, or if those benefits are delayed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and the value of our stock could be adversely impacted\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly with the completion of the spinoffs.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade now that the spinoffs are complete or the effect of the spinoffs on the trading prices of our common stock. Similarly, certain stockholders may experience a decrease in the aggregate value of their stock based on share price volatility of all three resulting companies post spin.\nWe may not realize the benefits from our retained ownership interests in LSC and Donnelley Financial.\nAs part of the spinoff transactions, we distributed approximately 80.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of each LSC and Donnelley Financial to our stockholders. After giving effect to these distributions, we retained approximately 19.25% of the outstanding shares of common stock of each of LSC and Donnelley Financial. In connection with the spinoff transactions, we entered into a stockholder and registration rights agreement with each of LSC and Donnelley Financial governing our ownership and potential disposition of the shares of common stock retained in each company. We expect to dispose of any shares of common stock of LSC and Donnelley Financial that we retained within the 12-month period following the initial distribution of shares of common stock of LSC and Donnelley Financial to our stockholders.\nAs with any investment in a publicly traded company, our retained ownership in each company is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the businesses of LSC and Donnelley Financial and risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in public equity markets generally. In addition, under the stockholders\u2019 and registration rights agreement, we gave a proxy to each company to vote all of our retained shares of common stock in proportion to the votes cast by LSC\u2019s and Donnelley Financial\u2019s other stockholders. Consequently, we do not retain any influence over the management and affairs of each of LSC and Donnelley Financial.\nPursuant to the stockholders\u2019 and registration rights agreement with each company, we may, at our option, dispose of shares of common stock of either company to investment banks in exchange for our outstanding public debt. Any disposition of shares of common stock of LSC or Donnelley Financial held by the Company in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for LSC common stock and Donnelley Financial common stock and thereby adversely affect the value of our retained ownership interests or adversely affect the terms and conditions of such disposition.\nPost-spin, we are a smaller company and may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in purchasing power.\nPrior to the completion of the spinoff transactions, we had been able to take advantage of our size and purchasing power in sourcing products and services from third-party vendors. Since the spinoff transactions are complete, we are a smaller company and may not have the same purchasing power that we had before the completion of the spinoff transactions. Although we are seeking to expand our direct purchasing relationships with many of our most important third-party vendors, we may be unable to obtain products and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to completion of the spinoff transactions, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management, which may be exacerbated by the spinoff transactions.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on the Company. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled labor. Many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than we offer. In addition, many members of our management team have significant industry experience that is valuable to our competitors. We enter into non-solicitation and, as appropriate, non-competition agreements with certain of our executive officers, prohibiting them contractually from soliciting our customers and employees and from leaving and joining a competitor within a specified period.\nFurthermore, as a result of the spinoff transactions, certain members of our senior management team prior to the spinoff, resigned from their roles with the Company to assume positions with either LSC or Donnelley Financial. The loss of members of our senior management team and other key employees due to the spinoff transactions may result in transitional challenges or temporary difficulty in managing our business properly, which could harm business prospects and our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe spinoff transactions could result in significant tax liability.\nWe obtained an opinion from our outside legal counsel substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distributions in connection with the spinoff transactions qualify as tax-free distributions under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Additionally, we have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that certain limited aspects of the distributions will not prevent the distributions from satisfying certain requirements for tax-free treatment under the Code. The opinion and the private letter ruling rely on customary factual representations and assumptions, which if incorrect or inaccurate may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion and letter ruling.\nIf either or both of the distributions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the common stock of such spun-off entity in a taxable sale for its fair value. In that case, we expect that RR Donnelley stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of the spun-off entity\u2019s common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each holder\u2019s tax basis in its Company common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. We expect that the amount of any such taxes to RR Donnelley stockholders and us would be substantial if this were to occur.", "PERMNO": 38682, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "RRD"}
