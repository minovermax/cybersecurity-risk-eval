{"cik": "1779474", "company": "WM TECHNOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves risks. Before you make a decision to buy our securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nAs our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to maintain profitability in the future.\nWhile our revenue has grown in recent periods, this growth may not be sustainable due to a number of factors, including the maturation of our business, slowdowns in the pace of issuance of new licenses to cannabis retailers and brands, and the eventual decline in the number of new major geographic markets in which the sale of cannabis is permitted and to which we have not already expanded. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability. Additionally, we expect our costs to increase in future periods as we expend substantial financial and other resources on, among other things:\n\u2022sales and marketing, including continued investment in our current marketing efforts and future marketing initiatives;\n\u2022hiring of additional employees, including in our product and engineering teams;\n\u2022expansion domestically and internationally in an effort to increase our consumer and client usage, client base, and our sales to our clients;\n\u2022development of new products, and increased investment in the ongoing development of our existing products;\n\u2022integrating our acquired companies into our operations; and\n\u2022general administration, including a significant increase in legal and accounting expenses related to public company compliance, continued compliance with various regulations applicable to cannabis industry businesses and other work arising from the growth and maturity of our company.\nThese expenditures may not result in additional revenue or the growth of our business. If we fail to continue to grow revenue or to sustain profitability, the market price of our securities could decline, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing clients and consumers or to acquire new clients and consumers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business may be harmed.\nWe compete in a dynamic, innovative market, which we expect will continue to evolve rapidly. We believe that our success is dependent on our ability to continue identifying and anticipating the needs of our clients and consumers and growing our two-sided network by retaining our existing clients and consumers and adding new clients and consumers. This two-sided network takes time to build and may grow more slowly than we expect or than it has grown in the past. As we have become larger through organic growth, the growth rates for MAUs, number of paying clients and monthly revenue per client have at times slowed and may similarly slow in the future, even if we continue to add clients and consumers on an absolute basis. Although we expect that our growth rates will continue to slow during certain periods as our business increases in size, if we fail to retain either our existing clients or consumers, the value of our two-sided network will be diminished.\nIn addition, the costs associated with client and consumer retention are substantially lower than costs associated with the acquisition of new clients or consumers. We have incurred significant costs to attract clients and consumers to our platform and expect to incur significant additional costs to attract and retain clients and consumers for the foreseeable future. Because expenditures on our platform can represent a significant financial investment for our clients, our ability to retain clients depends in part on our ability to create and maintain high levels of client and consumer satisfaction, which we may not always be capable of providing, including for reasons outside of our control. Additionally, in order to retain our clients, we may be required to identify ways to help our clients convert consumers more effectively. Our clients generally do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products and solutions and generally may cancel their use of our products and solutions at any time without penalty. Thus, any decrease in client satisfaction or other change negatively affecting our ability to retain clients could result in a rapid, concentrated impact to our results going forward. Therefore, our failure to retain existing clients or consumers, even if such losses are offset by an increase in revenue resulting from the acquisition of new clients or consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may fail to offer the optimal pricing of our products and solutions.\nWe have limited experience in determining the optimal pricing of our products and solutions, including our newly acquired products and solutions, and we may need to change our pricing model from time to time. For example, at the end of 2020 we changed our pricing model for our subscription software services to our WM Business bundled software services model and increased the amount our clients need to pay to access our listing products. We also have historically priced our add-on premium offerings in a bid-auction format. Our ability to continue growing depends on our ability to maintain and expand our client base. If our clients do not believe the incremental additional cost we are charging for WM Business is justified by the additional components included in our software bundles or that our add-on offerings do not generate proper return on investment, such clients may decline to continue using our services, and our revenue and other financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to expand effectively into new markets, our revenue and business will be adversely affected.\nWhile a key part of our business strategy is to add clients and consumers in our existing geographic markets, we intend to expand our operations into new markets if and as cannabis continues to be legalized. Any such expansion places us in competitive markets with which we may be unfamiliar, requires us to analyze the potential applicability of new and potentially complicated regulations regarding the usage, sale and marketing of cannabis, and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant time and resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. For example, we intend to expand in 2022 with the launch of our products and solutions and attracting and retaining clients and consumers on the East Coast. As a result of such expansion, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully. In attempting to establish a presence in new markets, we expect to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our compliance efforts to cover those new markets. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these expenses. Our current and any future expansion plans will require significant resources and management attention.\nOur business is concentrated in California, and, as a result, our performance may be affected by factors unique to the California market.\nCalifornia represents one of the largest state legal cannabis markets in the United States, and approximately 64.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, was generated in California. As new markets develop and our current markets expand, we anticipate that there will be a reduction in the percentage of our revenue generated in California, but we do not know with any certainty when and to what degree, if ever, this would occur. Moreover, the cannabis market in California is rapidly evolving, and we expect our growth in California to continue as the cannabis industry continues to develop, which could further concentrate our client base. As a result, our business and results of operations are particularly susceptible to trends in the California cannabis market, as well as adverse economic, regulatory, political and other conditions in California. Additionally, adverse economic, regulatory, political or other developments that are limited to California may have a disproportionately greater effect on us. In particular, we rely on licensed cannabis businesses to drive the growth of our revenue and the use of our products, and the failure of the licensed cannabis markets to sufficiently overtake or eliminate the illegal market may have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our revenue, particularly if the slow pace of licensing allows the illegal market to gain a foothold, which may be more likely to occur in jurisdictions with an extended period of time between the authorization of consumer possession and the time at which licensed retailers become operational. In such jurisdictions, the timeline for licensed cannabis businesses overtaking the illegal market may be extended.\nFederal law enforcement may deem our clients to be in violation of U.S. federal law, and, in particular the CSA. A change in U.S. federal policy on cannabis enforcement and strict enforcement of federal cannabis laws against our clients would undermine our business model and materially affect our business and operations.\nU.S. federal law, and more specifically the CSA, proscribes the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, advertisement and possession of cannabis. As a result, U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal or unauthorized production, distribution, promotion, sale, possession, or use of cannabis, may seek to bring criminal actions against our clients under the CSA. On August 4, 2021, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California (\u201cDOJ\u201d) withdrew a subpoena served on us in September 2019, and informed us that it had no present plan to exercise its discretion to proceed further in the matter. The DOJ also stated that its decision was not a grant of immunity, however, and there can be no assurance that the DOJ - either the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California or another DOJ entity - will not initiate another investigation in the future. If our clients are found to be violating U.S. federal law relating to cannabis, they may be subject not only to criminal charges and convictions, but also to forfeiture of property, significant fines and penalties, disgorgement of profits, administrative sanctions, cessation of business activities, or civil liabilities arising from proceedings initiated by either the U.S. government or private citizens. Any of these actions or consequences on our clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition, or could force us to cease operations, and as a result, our investors could lose their entire investment.\nFurther, to the extent any law enforcement actions require us to respond to subpoenas, or undergo search warrants, for client records, cannabis businesses could elect to cease using our products. Until the U.S. federal government changes the laws with respect to cannabis, and particularly if the U.S. Congress does not extend the Omnibus Spending Bill\u2019s protection of state\nmedical cannabis programs, described below, to apply to all state cannabis programs, U.S. federal authorities could more strictly enforce current federal prohibitions and restrictions. An increase in federal enforcement against companies licensed under state cannabis laws could negatively impact the state cannabis industries and, in turn, our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.\nSome of our clients or their listings currently and in the future may not be in compliance with licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations. Allowing unlicensed or noncompliant businesses to access our products, or allowing businesses to use our solutions in a noncompliant manner, may subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation. In addition, allowing businesses that engage in false or deceptive advertising practices to use our solutions may subject us to negative publicity, which could have similar adverse impacts on us.\nOur clients are contractually required to represent, warrant and covenant to us that they conduct their business in compliance with applicable state law, which includes any applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state or province in which they do business. Clients further contractually agree to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their noncompliance. We rely on our clients\u2019 contractual representations, and generally do not verify them, other than with respect to the licensing information of our clients operating cannabis retail businesses, where we currently require such clients to provide evidence of a valid state or provincial cannabis license prior to their initial access and from time to time during the term of their use of such products. Previously, we only required retail listings and premium placement clients to provide us with a state license number at the time we initially onboarded them, and did not routinely validate whether that license number actually was authorized for use by the client or whether it remains valid. We require all operational cannabis retailer clients, including storefronts and delivery services, to display on their listing a valid, unexpired state-issued license number. We also currently require cannabis brand clients to provide evidence of a valid state or provincial license in order to get access to our listings and premium placement products. Additionally, many states do not require a license to sell CBD products at retail, and the illicit market could fraudulently attempt to use our CBD listings product to sell products containing THC. While we periodically audit and respond to reports related to our CBD listings, it is difficult to monitor the individual products listed, and marketing claims contained, in the listings of our CBD clients. As a result, some of our clients or their listings currently and in the future may not be in compliance with licensing and related requirements under applicable state or provincial laws and regulations. There could be legal enforcement actions against unlicensed or insufficiently licensed entities selling cannabis or CBD, which could negatively impact us.\nAny legal or regulatory enforcement against us based on the business solutions that we offer, the third-party content available on our platform or noncompliance by our clients with licensing and other legal requirements, could subject us to various risks, including monetary penalties and the risk that we elect or are compelled to remove content from our platform and would likely cause us to experience negative publicity. Any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand, and reputation.\nWhile our solutions provide features to support our clients\u2019 compliance with the complex, disparate and constantly evolving regulations and other legal requirements applicable to the cannabis industry, we generally do not, and cannot, ensure that our clients will conduct their business activities in a manner compliant with such regulations and requirements. As a result, federal, state, provincial or local government authorities may seek to bring criminal, administrative or regulatory enforcement actions against our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial conditions, or could force us to cease operations.\nWhile our solutions provide features to support our clients\u2019 compliance with certain regulations and other legal requirements applicable to the cannabis industry, we generally do not, and cannot, ensure that our clients will conduct their business activities in a manner compliant with such regulations and requirements, in whole or in part. Their legal noncompliance could result in regulatory and even criminal actions against them, which could a material adverse impact on our business and operating results or financial condition, and as a result, our investors could lose their entire investment. For additional information, see the other risk factors in this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry,\u201d including \u201cSome of our clients or their listings currently and in the future may not be in compliance with licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations. Allowing unlicensed or noncompliant businesses to access our products, or allowing businesses to use our solutions in a noncompliant manner, may subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation. In addition, allowing businesses who engage in false or deceptive advertising practices to use our solutions may subject us to negative publicity, which could have similar adverse impacts on us.\u201d\nOur business is dependent on U.S. state laws and regulations and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations pertaining to the cannabis industry.\nAlthough the federal CSA classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, many U.S. states have legalized cannabis to varying degrees. In addition, the enactment of the Cannabis Act legalized the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for medical and adult-use purposes in Canada and created a federal legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, promotion, sale and possession of cannabis. The Cannabis Act also provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate other aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution, sale, minimum age requirements\n(subject to the minimum set forth in the Cannabis Act), places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes. In addition, subsection 23(1) of the Cannabis Act provides that it is prohibited to publish, broadcast or otherwise disseminate, on behalf of another person, with or without consideration, any promotion that is prohibited by a number of sections of the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act therefore includes provisions that could apply to certain aspects of our business, both directly to the solutions we provide and indirectly on account of any noncompliance by those who use our offerings. However, as the Cannabis Act has been recently enacted, there is a lack of available interpretation, application and enforcement of the provisions that may be relevant to digital platforms such as ours, and as a result, it is difficult to assess our potential exposure under the Cannabis Act.\nLaws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry in U.S. states and Canada are continually changing. Any change or even the speed of changes could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan, and could detrimentally affect our operations, revenue, and profitability. Similarly, if the pace of issuance of new cannabis licenses is slower than expected, our ability to acquire new clients and grow our revenue could be harmed. The commercial cannabis industry is still a young industry, and we cannot predict the impact of the compliance regime to which it may be subject. We will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance, and such costs may prove to be material. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on our operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof, or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to our operations or increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGiven the concentration of our revenue from the sale of listing products, any increase in the stringency of any applicable laws, including U.S. state, or Canadian federal, provincial or territorial, laws and regulations relating to cannabis, or any escalation in the enforcement of such existing laws and regulations against the current or putative cannabis industry within any jurisdiction, could negatively impact the profitability or viability of cannabis businesses in such affected jurisdictions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, although we have not yet been required to obtain any cannabis license as a result of existing cannabis regulations, it is possible that cannabis regulations may be enacted in the future that will require us to obtain such a cannabis license or otherwise seek to substantially regulate our business. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we may be required to seek and obtain a blanket approval of our platform in order to enable potential clients to access our services, and such approval may be subject to significant regulator discretion. U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial, local and other non-U.S. jurisdictions\u2019 cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. Our failure to adequately manage the risk associated with future regulations and adequately manage future compliance requirements may adversely affect our business, our status as a reporting company and our public listing. Further, any adverse pronouncements from political leaders or regulators about businesses related to the legal cannabis industry could adversely affect the price of our securities.\nThe rapid changes in the cannabis industry and applicable laws and regulations make predicting and evaluating our future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nThe cannabis industry - and the complex regulatory regime applicable to it - is evolving rapidly and may develop in ways that we cannot anticipate. The pace of dramatic change in the cannabis industry makes it difficult to assess our future prospects, and you should evaluate our business in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter as the industry continues to evolve. These risks and difficulties include:\n\u2022managing complex, disparate and rapidly evolving regulatory regimes imposed by U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial, local and other non-U.S. governments around the world applicable to cannabis and cannabis-related businesses;\n\u2022adapting to rapidly evolving trends in the cannabis industry and the way consumers and cannabis industry businesses interact with technology;\n\u2022maintaining and increasing our base of clients and consumers;\n\u2022continuing to preserve and build our brand while upgrading our existing offerings;\n\u2022successfully attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel to manage operations;\n\u2022adapting to changes in the cannabis industry if sales of cannabis expands significantly beyond a regulated model, and commodification of the cannabis industry;\n\u2022successfully implementing and executing our business and marketing strategies; and\n\u2022successfully expanding our business into new and existing cannabis markets.\nIf the demand for our software solutions does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of our clients or consumers, our business will be harmed. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause our business is dependent, in part, upon continued market acceptance of cannabis by consumers, any negative trends could adversely affect our business operations.\nWe are dependent on public support, continued market acceptance and the proliferation of consumers in the state-level and Canadian legal cannabis markets. While we believe that the market and opportunities in the space will continue to grow, we cannot predict the future growth rate or size of the market. Any downturns in, or negative outlooks on, the cannabis industry may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nExpansion of our business is dependent on the continued legalization of cannabis.\nExpansion of our business is in part dependent upon continued legislative authorization, including by voter initiatives and referenda, of cannabis in various jurisdictions worldwide. Any number of factors could slow, halt, or even reverse progress in this area. For example, some ballot measures in 2020 were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, progress for the industry, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action in a particular jurisdiction, numerous factors could impact the legislative process, including lobbying efforts by opposing stakeholders as well as legislators\u2019 disagreements about how to legalize cannabis as well as the interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of applicable laws or regulations. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the legalization of cannabis, which would negatively impact our ability to expand our business. Additionally, the expansion of our business also depends on jurisdictions in which cannabis is currently legalized not narrowing, limiting or repealing existing laws legalizing and regulating cannabis, or altering the regulatory landscape in a way that diminishes the viability of cannabis businesses in those jurisdictions. For example, in April 2019, a lawsuit was filed in the Fresno County Superior Court challenging the California Bureau of Cannabis Control regulation that allowed cannabis businesses to deliver products in local jurisdictions which had prohibited the sale of cannabis. In November 2020, in a mixed result, the Fresno County Superior Court upheld the state regulation that allows licensed cannabis delivery companies to offer services anywhere in the state, while also affirming that cities and counties can forbid those operations, though enforcement of the bans is also up to the local governments. More litigation is likely to follow if local governments ban deliveries into their jurisdictions. This result may negatively impact the viability and attractiveness of our offerings in California going forward. We generated approximately 64.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 in California, and such developments may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For more information, see \u201c-Our business is concentrated in California, and, as a result, our performance may be affected by factors unique to the California market.\u201d Additionally, if such challenges are successful in any other jurisdictions that have legalized or are in the process of legalizing cannabis, our ability to expand our business would be negatively impacted.\nIf clients and consumers using our platform fail to provide high-quality content that attracts consumers, we may not be able to generate sufficient consumer traffic to remain competitive.\nOur success depends on our platform providing consumers with useful information about our clients and their products, which in turn depends on the content provided by consumers and clients. For example, the platform will not provide useful information about cannabis brands or products if clients or consumers do not contribute content that is helpful and reliable, or if they remove previously submitted content.\nAdditionally, if we filter out helpful content or fail to filter out unhelpful content, clients and consumers alike may stop or reduce their use of our platform and products, which could negatively impact our business. For example, in 2016, the media reported allegations that many of the consumer-generated reviews on our website were fake or inauthentic. Allegations made against us, whether or not accurate, can materially harm our reputation and operating results. While we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify and remove offensive, biased, unreliable, inauthentic, duplicative, fraudulent or otherwise unhelpful content, and have implemented safeguards on the platform to facilitate those efforts, we cannot guarantee that those efforts or safeguards will be effective or adequate. If our website is not perceived as providing useful, accurate and current information about our clients and their products, consumers may stop or reduce their use of our platform, which could suppress the demand for our advertising placements and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the erosion or degradation of our brand recognition or reputation would likely adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe believe that our business is highly dependent on our brand identity and our reputation, which is critical to our ability to attract and retain clients and consumers. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in the markets in which we operate continues to develop. Our success in this area will depend on a wide range of factors, some of which are within our control and some of which are not. The factors affecting our brand recognition and reputation that are within our control include the following:\n\u2022the efficacy of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022our ability to maintain a high-quality, innovative, and error- and bug-free platform;\n\u2022our ability to maintain high satisfaction among clients and consumers;\n\u2022the quality and perceived value of our platform;\n\u2022successfully implementing and developing new features, including alternative revenue streams;\n\u2022our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce trademarks and other indicia of origin that are valuable to our brand;\n\u2022our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022our compliance with laws and regulations, including those applicable to any political action committees affiliated with us and to our registered lobbying activities;\n\u2022our ability to provide client support; and\n\u2022any actual or perceived data breach or data loss, or misuse or perceived misuse of our platform.\nIn addition, our brand recognition and reputation may be affected by factors that are outside our control, such as:\n\u2022actions of competitors or other third parties;\n\u2022the quality and timeliness of our clients\u2019 delivery businesses;\n\u2022consumers\u2019 experiences with clients or products identified through our platform;\n\u2022negative publicity regarding our company or operations, as well as with respect to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, partners, including celebrities who endorse or promote our brand, or others associated with any of these parties;\n\u2022interruptions, delays or attacks on our platform; and\n\u2022litigation or regulatory developments.\nDamage to our reputation and loss of brand equity from one or more of the factors listed above may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be costly and time-consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nWe currently face intense competition in the cannabis information market, and we expect competition to further intensify as the cannabis industry continues to evolve.\nThe cannabis information market is rapidly evolving and is currently characterized by intense competition, due in part to relatively low barriers to entry. We expect competition to further intensify in the future as cannabis continues to be legalized and regulated, new technologies are developed and new participants enter the cannabis information market. Our direct competitors for individual components of our platform include cannabis-focused, two-sided networks like Leafly (for retailer listing pages), Dutchie and Jane Technologies (for menu embed and orders functionality), Leaflink and Leaftrade (for B2B sales) and a variety of cannabis-focused point-of-sale providers. In addition, our platform also may compete with current or potential products and solutions offered by internet search engines and advertising networks, like Google, general two-sided networks like Yelp, various other newspaper, television, media companies, outdoor billboard advertising, and online merchant platforms, such as Shopify, Square, and Lightspeed. For example, Uber Eats announced a partnership with a Canadian retailer in November 2021 to allow consumers to place cannabis orders for pickup via Uber Eats. If the regulatory regime for cannabis becomes more settled and the legal market for cannabis becomes more accepted, competition may further intensify as new participants may be encouraged to enter the cannabis information market, including established companies, such as tobacco and alcohol companies, with substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than existing market participants. Additionally, as consumers and cannabis industry clients demand richer data, integrations with other cannabis industry participants such as point-of-sale providers and loyalty service providers may become increasingly important. If we are unable to complete such new integrations as quickly as our competitors, or improve our existing integrations based on legacy systems, we may lose market share to such competitors. Our current and future competitors may also enjoy other competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, more varied or more focused offerings, better market acceptance, and larger budgets. Some of our competitors recently raised significant amounts of capital. For example, in August 2021, Jane announced the closing of a $100 million Series C round of funding; in October 2021, Dutchie announced the closing of a $350 million Series D round of funding at a valuation of $3.75 billion; and in February 2022, Leafly became a public company and began trading on Nasdaq via a SPAC business combination. Our competitors may be able to use such capital infusions to more successfully enter new markets opening up, such as major east coast markets opening up in 2022.\nAdditionally, as the legalization of cannabis continues, cannabis cultivators and distributors could experience consolidation as existing cannabis businesses seek to obtain greater market share and purchasing power and new entrants seek to establish a significant market presence. Consolidation of the cannabis markets could reduce the size of our potential client base and give remaining clients greater bargaining or purchasing power. This may in turn erode the prices for our advertising placements and result in decreased margins. Consolidation could particularly affect smaller cannabis businesses, with whom we have historically conducted the majority of our business. Further, heightened competition between cannabis businesses could ultimately have a negative impact on the viability of individual market participants, which could reduce or eliminate their ability to purchase our products and solution.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively for any of these reasons, we may be unable to maintain our operations or develop our products and solutions, and as a result our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid organic growth in our headcount and operations, which places substantial demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As a result of our rapid growth, many of our employees have been with us for less than 24 months. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to improve existing, and implement new, transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We will also be required to expand our finance, administrative and operations staff. We intend to continue making substantial investments in our technology, sales and data infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a significant number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our existing corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork and a passion for our products and clients. In addition, our revenue may not grow at the same rate as the expansion of our business. There can be no assurance that our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations or that management will be able to hire, train, retrain, motivate and manage required personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, the quality of our platform, efficiency of our operations, and management of our expenses could suffer, which could negatively impact our brand, business, profitability and operating results.\nIf we are unable to recruit, train, retain and motivate key personnel, we may not achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, retain and motivate key personnel, including Christopher Beals, our Chief Executive Officer; Brian Camire, our General Counsel; Justin Dean, our Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer; Juanjo Feijoo, our Chief Operating Officer; and Arden Lee, our Chief Financial Officer. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense, particularly in Southern California, where we are headquartered. Additionally, we face additional challenges in attracting, retaining and motivating highly qualified personnel due to our relationship to the cannabis industry, which is rapidly evolving and has varying levels of social acceptance. We generally do not maintain fixed term employment contracts or key man life insurance with any of our employees. Any failure to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel could materially harm our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe rely on search engine placement, syndicated content, paid digital advertising, and social media marketing to attract a meaningful portion of our clients and consumers. If we are not able to generate traffic to our website through search engines and paid digital advertising, or increase the profile of our company brand through social media engagement, our ability to attract new clients may be impaired.\nMany consumers locate our website through internet search engines, like Google, and paid digital advertisements in certain jurisdictions. The prominence of our website in response to internet searches is a critical factor in the attractiveness of our advertising placements, and our digital marketing efforts, such as search engine optimization, are intended to improve our search result rankings and draw additional traffic to our website. Visits to our website could decline significantly if we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, including ineffective implementation of our digital marketing strategies or any change by a search engine to its ranking algorithms or advertising policies.\nVisits to our website could also decline if our accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter are shut down or restricted. We work across these social networks to increase brand awareness of our company by consumers and clients, and to promote client acquisition. Our engagement on these social media platforms is subject to their respective terms of service and community guidelines, which generally restrict the promotion, sale and, often, depiction of cannabis. While we do not directly promote the sale of cannabis or cannabis-related products by our clients on these social media platforms, the perception that we may be engaging in such promotion or our inadvertent violation of other aspects of these platforms\u2019 terms of service or community guidelines may result in our accounts being shut down or restricted. For example, our Instagram account was suspended in 2015, and it was recently suspended again in December 2021 until February 2022. Our accounts might also be suspended or restricted due to changes in the rules and regulations of such social media platforms. Any such suspension or restriction could result in reduced traffic to our website and diminished demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our current marketing model is not effective in attracting new clients, we may need to employ higher-cost sales and marketing methods to attract and retain clients, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use our sales team to build relationships with our client base. Our sales team builds and maintains relationships with clients primarily through phone and email contact, which is designed to allow us to cost-effectively service a large number of clients. We have significantly invested in our enterprise and field sales teams, and we may need to further employ more resource-intensive sales methods to continue to attract and retain clients, particularly as we increase the number of our clients and our client base employs more sophisticated marketing operations, strategies and processes. This could cause us to incur higher sales and marketing expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf the Google Play Store or Apple iTunes App Store limit the functionality or availability of our mobile application platform, including as a result of changes or violations of terms and conditions, access to and utilization of our platform may suffer.\nOur platform is available for download on iOS and Android, and is also accessible online. The availability of our platform and its various functionalities to a significant percentage of our clients is subject to standard policies and terms of service of these third-party platforms, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation generally of our platform. In addition, each platform provider has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to our platform and its functionalities, and those changes and interpretations may be unfavorable. A platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of its platform, or restrict how users can access the platform, which would similarly be unfavorable.\nFor example, we have at times been unable to offer our WM Orders functionality in our iOS Weedmaps mobile application and are currently unable to offer such functionality in our Android Weedmaps mobile application due to restrictions imposed by the Apple iTunes App Store and Google Play, respectively. While our platform is still available in the Apple iTunes App Store and on Google Play for download, there can be no assurance that our platform or all of its functionalities will remain available in the immediate or longer term. To the extent that we are limited or prohibited from making some or all of our solutions available through any third-party platform, including the Apple iTunes App Store or the Google Play Store, we may need, or choose, to provide our solutions through alternative venues that may be more difficult for potential users to access. Limits on, or discontinuation of, access to our mobile platform or its various functionalities could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on utilization of our platform, our business, and our ability to attract clients and consumers.\nWe may be unable to scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure in a timely or effective manner to ensure that our platform is accessible, which would harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nIt is critical to our success that clients and consumers within our geographic markets be able to access our platform at all times. We have previously experienced service disruptions, and in the future, we may experience service disruptions, outages or other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints, and distributed denial of service, or DDoS, fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our products become more complex and our traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when consumers attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, consumers may seek other solutions and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would harm our ability to attract clients and decrease the frequency with which they subscribe for our advertising placements. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, respond adequately to service disruptions, upgrade our systems as needed or continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe expect to continue making significant investments in the functionality, performance, reliability, design, security and scalability of our platform. We may experience difficulties with the development of our platform that could delay or prevent the implementation of new solutions and enhancements. Software development involves a significant amount of time and resources for our product development team, and we may not be able to continue making those investments in the future.\nTo the extent we are not able to continue successfully improving and enhancing our platform, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur payment system and the payment systems of our clients depend on third-party providers and are subject to evolving laws and regulations.\nWe have engaged third-party service providers to perform credit and debit card processing services for client\u2019s payments to us, and we understand that some of our clients use those services, and we may engage third-party service providers in the future to provide fraud analysis services. We also may integrate with third-party service providers used by our clients to process payments made by consumers. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships, or the relationships of our clients, with these service providers were to terminate, our ability or the ability of our clients to process payments could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. The laws and regulations related to payments are complex and are potentially impacted by tensions between federal and state treatment of the vaporization, tobacco, nicotine, cannabis, CBD and hemp, and cannabis accessories industries. These laws and regulations also vary across different jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering our clients the ability to pay with credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers. As we expand the availability of these payment methods or offer new payment methods to our clients in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. Due to the constantly evolving and complex laws and regulations applicable to our industry, third-party merchant banks and third-party payment processors may consider our business a high risk. This could cause a third party to discontinue\nits services to us, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement. If this were to occur, we would need to collect from our clients using less efficient methods, which could adversely impact our collections, revenues and financial performance. Additionally, if a third party were to discontinue its services to us or if the applicable laws and regulations were to evolve in a way that impacted us negatively, we may not be able to realize our plans of expanding our business offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our plans for expansion. For more information, see \u201c-We are subject to industry standards, governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business\u201d below.\nFurther, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processors, we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including restrictions on product mix and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Additionally, any data breach or failure to hold certain information in accordance with PCI-DSS may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe calculate and track performance metrics with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third-party. While we believe our metrics are reasonable estimates of our user or client base for the applicable period of measurement, the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and may be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. For example, user accounts are based on email addresses, and a user could use multiple email addresses to establish multiple accounts, and clients in many instances will have multiple accounts. As a result, the data we report may not be accurate. Our internal tools and processes we use to identify multiple accounts or fraudulent accounts have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking key metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments and we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such changes. Though we regularly review our processes for calculating metrics and may adjust our processes for calculating metrics to improve their accuracy, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, user or client base, or traffic levels; if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, user or client base or traffic levels, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, our reputation may be harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur clients and investors rely on our key metrics as a representation of our performance. If these third parties do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or user engagement, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics, our reputation may be harmed and retailers may be less willing to list a business on our platform, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to prevent others from aggregating or misappropriating data from our websites.\nFrom time to time, third parties have misappropriated data from our website through website scraping, software robots or other means, and aggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. Additionally, copycat websites have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. We may be unable to detect all such websites in a timely manner and even timely technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations or protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among clients or consumers, decreases the likelihood that consumers use our platform to access information, or reduces the distinctiveness of our products in the marketplace, our brand and business could be harmed.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platform could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe update our platform on a frequent basis. Despite efforts to test our updates, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in our platform until after it is deployed to our clients. We have discovered and expect we will continue to discover errors, failures and bugs in our platform and anticipate that certain of these errors, failures and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after deployment to clients. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, security incidents, such as data breaches, government inquiries, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, or claims by clients for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for client relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.\nWe implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regular system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of inaccuracies in the data we collect for our clients, or unauthorized access or damage to, or the loss, acquisition, or inadvertent release or exposure of confidential or other sensitive data could cause our reputation to be harmed and result in claims against us, and cannabis businesses may elect not to purchase our products or, in the case of existing clients, renew their agreements with us or we may incur increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects or errors in our software or other performance problems may be substantial and could harm our operating results and growth prospects.\nA distributed denial of service attack, ransomware attack, security breach or unauthorized data access could impair or incapacitate our information technology systems and delay or interrupt service to our clients and consumers, harm our reputation, or subject us to significant liability.\nWe may become subject to DDoS attacks, a technique used by hackers to take an internet service offline by overloading its servers. In addition, ransomware attacks against businesses of all sizes are becoming increasingly common. Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Our platform may be subject to DDoS, ransomware or other cybersecurity attacks in the future and we cannot guarantee that applicable recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures are or will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure or data loss. Moreover, our platform could be breached if vulnerabilities in our platform are exploited by unauthorized third parties or others. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, and the size of DDoS attacks and the number and types of ransomware attacks are increasing. As a result, we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop such attacks while they are occurring. A DDoS attack, ransomware attack or security breach could delay or interrupt service to our clients and consumers and may deter the utilization of our platform.\nWe also use information technology and security systems to maintain the physical security of our facilities and to protect our proprietary and confidential information, including that of our clients, consumers, and employees. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, or viruses, loggers, malware, ransomware, or other malfeasant code in our data or software, could compromise this information or render our systems and data unusable. Additionally, we rely on a number of third-party \u201ccloud-based\u201d providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services, some financial functions, and systems used to provide solutions to our clients, and we are therefore dependent on the security systems of these providers. Any security breaches or other unauthorized access to our service providers\u2019 facilities or systems, or viruses, loggers, malware, ransomware or other malfeasant code in their data or software, could expose us to information loss, and misappropriation of confidential information, and other security breaches. In addition, our employees, contractors, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate personal information, confidential information or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage security systems, or to obtain unauthorized access to data we or our contractors maintain, change frequently and are often not recognized until after an attack, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate the techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.\nAny actual or perceived DDoS attack, ransomware attack, security breach or other unauthorized access could damage our reputation and brand, result in decreased utilization of our platform, expose us to fines and penalties, government investigations, and a risk of litigation and possible liability, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate any resulting problems and otherwise to remediate the incident, and require us to expend increased cybersecurity protection costs. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security related incidents. Numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations require companies to notify individuals and/or regulatory authorities of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Any disclosures of security breaches, pursuant to these laws or regulations or otherwise, could lead to regulatory investigations and enforcement and negative publicity, and may cause our clients and consumers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures.\nAdditionally, our discovery of any security breach or other security-related incident, or our provision of any related notice, may be delayed or be perceived to have been delayed. Any of these impacts or circumstances arising from an actual or perceived attack, breach or other unauthorized access could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation and relationships with clients and consumers.\nFurthermore, while our errors and omissions insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experienced a significant security incident, we could be subject to claims or damages that exceed our insurance coverage. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nWe rely upon cloud-based data centers, infrastructure and technologies provided by third parties, and technology systems and electronic networks supplied and managed by third parties, to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these systems, technologies and networks may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to host our cloud-based infrastructure that operates our business. If any of these services becomes unavailable or otherwise is unable to serve our requirements due to extended outages, interruptions, or facility closure, or because it is no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our operations otherwise could be disrupted or otherwise impacted until appropriate substitute services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the data center facilities and infrastructure we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyberattack, terrorism and similar other events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, to adverse events caused by operator error, and to interruptions, data loss or corruption, and other performance problems due to various factors, including introductions of new capabilities, technology errors, infrastructure changes, DDoS attacks, or other security-related incidents. Changes in law or regulations applicable to data centers in various jurisdictions could also cause a disruption in service. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our platform operations and the loss, corruption of, unauthorized access to or acquisition of client or consumer data.\nOur platform also depends on our ability to communicate through the public internet and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties. In addition, in order to provide our solutions on-demand and promptly, our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours per day, which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by third parties and the availability of electricity, which we do not control. A severe disruption of one or more of these networks or facilities, including as a result of utility or third-party system interruptions, could impair our ability to process information and provide our solutions to our clients and consumers.\nAny unavailability of, or failure to meet our requirements by, third-party data centers or other third-party technologies or services, or any disruption of the internet, utilities or the third-party networks or facilities that we rely upon, could impede our ability to make our platform accessible, harm our reputation, result in reduced traffic from consumers, cause us to issue refunds or credits to our clients, and subject us to potential liabilities. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur operations and employees face risks related to health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters or anywhere else we operates, and the business or operations of our clients, consumers, partners or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented significant measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including closures, quarantines, travel restrictions and other social distancing directives, and fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief.\nTo the extent that restrictions or prevention and mitigation measures are implemented in the future, there may be an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending, which could materially and adversely affect our operations as well as our relationships with clients and consumers. For instance, despite the overall increases in demand described below, some of our clients\u2019 operations were initially significantly disrupted in certain jurisdictions, causing a temporary significant decrease in activity on our platform in those jurisdictions.\nBeginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand from retailers, including storefronts and delivery services, for our technology solutions (such as clients using WM Orders functionality to enable reservation of products by consumers for curbside pickup), which resulted in increased revenue (including from technology services fees relating to product reservation orders submitted prior to December 31, 2020, although such per order fee has been eliminated effective January 1, 2021). Although we experienced increased consumer demand in the form of increases in MAU, we cannot determine what, if any, impact the pandemic had on our MAU growth in 2020. While we believe, like other industries, the pandemic accelerated existing trends towards consumer adoption of online platforms, we cannot be certain to what impact, if any, the end of the pandemic will have on our MAUs or MAU growth. To the extent the circumstances that accelerated the initial growth of our business stemmed from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this may not continue in the future, and the growth rates in revenue and increases in MAUs may decline in future periods.\nShelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact our client\u2019s ability to operate their businesses, consumers\u2019 ability to pick up orders, and our client\u2019s ability to make deliveries. Such events have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a temporary closure of our clients\u2019 businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures,\nand many of our clients may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if our clients are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate with limited hours and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of our clients\u2019 businesses could adversely affect our business. Further, we may experience a decrease in new clients due to a lack of financial resources or a decline in new markets as businesses and financial markets deal with the impact of COVID-19. Further, these conditions may impact our ability to access financial markets to obtain the necessary funding to expand our business as currently contemplated, which may adversely affect our liquidity and working capital.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Our clients may be perceived as unsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our platform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar public health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the CARES Act and FFCRA were enacted to provide economic relief to businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to the relief related to federal employment taxes provided in such legislation, we have (i) elected to defer eligible payroll taxes, which will be due in two equal installments in 2021 and 2022, and (ii) claimed certain employment-related tax credits under the legislation. While we may be eligible to receive some economic relief pursuant to the CARES Act, FFCRA or other legislation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, cannabis businesses may not be eligible to take full advantage of the government-sponsored COVID-19 relief packages. As a result, we may not benefit from these relief efforts to the same extent other businesses do in different industries. These relief measures, including the CARES Act, may be beneficial to us in one or more reporting periods but may adversely affect us on a going-forward basis. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred payroll taxes of $1.8 million, all of which was paid during the second quarter of 2021.\nThe extent of COVID-19\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, the rate of vaccinations, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, if the pandemic continues to persist as a severe worldwide health crisis, the disease may harm our business, and may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nYou should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in the uncertain and rapidly evolving market for our solutions. Because the cannabis information market is new and evolving, predicting its future growth rate and size is difficult. This reduces our ability to accurately evaluate our future prospects and forecast quarterly or annual performance. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022our ability to attract new clients and consumers and retain existing clients and consumers;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses;\n\u2022the effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\n\u2022the effects of increased competition on our business;\n\u2022our ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n\u2022the impact of global, regional or economic conditions;\n\u2022the ability of licensed cannabis markets to successfully grow and outcompete illegal cannabis markets;\n\u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and effectively manage an adequate rate of growth;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\n\u2022costs associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims and related judgments or settlements;\n\u2022changes in governmental or other regulation affecting our business;\n\u2022interruptions in platform availability and any related impact on our business, reputation or brand;\n\u2022the attraction and retention of qualified personnel;\n\u2022the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of our internal controls.\nWe may improve our products and solutions in ways that forego short-term gains.\nWe seek to provide the best experience for the clients and consumers who use our platform. Some of our changes may have the effect of reducing our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the benefits will ultimately improve our business and financial performance over the long term. Any short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be greater than planned or the changes mentioned above may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations, including social, political and economic flux and compliance with additional U.S. and foreign laws, including those related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and may not be able to successfully maintain or expand our foreign operations.\nWe sell our WM Business offering in the United States, currently offer some of our WM Business solutions in Canada and have a limited number of non-monetized listings in several other countries including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. We anticipate growing our business, in part, by continuing to expand our foreign operations. As we continue our expansion, we may enter new foreign markets where we have limited or no experience marketing and deploying our platform. If we fail to launch or manage our foreign operations successfully, our business may suffer. Additionally, as our foreign operations expand, or more of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our operating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. In addition, as our foreign operations continue to grow, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022political, social, and economic instability;\n\u2022risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy and data protection, and unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022complying with tax requirements of multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022the ability to present our content effectively in foreign languages;\n\u2022complying with a variety of foreign laws, including certain employment laws requiring national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions, and termination requirements;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and compliance costs associated with multiple foreign locations;\n\u2022regulations that might add difficulties in repatriating cash earned outside the United States and otherwise preventing us from freely moving cash;\n\u2022import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\n\u2022complying with statutory equity requirements;\n\u2022complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Corruption of Public Officials Act (Canada), and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022export controls and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nWe are subject to industry standards, governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental authorities, including those responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, antibribery laws, lobbying and election laws, securities laws and tax laws. These laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus we must continue to monitor and dedicate resources to ensure continued compliance.\nIn addition, our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and foreign governmental agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches); federal and state consumer protection and employment laws; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA; and European and other foreign data protection laws.\nWe receive, store, process, and use personal information and other user content. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide, including in the United States, is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, as many new laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, or PII, and other data have been adopted or are under consideration and existing laws and regulations may be subject to new and changing interpretations. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes significant additional requirements with respect to the collection of personal information from California residents. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, significantly modified the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses. The CPRA created a new California state agency charged with enforcing state privacy laws, and there is uncertainty about potential enforcement actions that the new agency may take in the future. The effects of the CCPA and the CPRA remain far-reaching, and depending on final regulatory guidance and related developments, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nMany foreign countries and governmental bodies, including Canada and the European Union, or E.U., and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, internet protocol addresses and other types of data. In Canada, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, governs the collection, use and disclosure of PII in many provinces in Canada, and though it is silent with respect to territorial reach, the Federal Court of Canada has found that PIPEDA will apply to businesses established in other jurisdictions if there is a \u201creal and substantial connection\u201d between the organization\u2019s activities and Canada. Provincial privacy commissioners take a similar approach to the interpretation and application of provincial private-sector privacy laws equivalent to PIPEDA. Further, Canada has robust anti-spam legislation. Organizations sending commercial electronic messages to individuals must either have express consent from the individual in the prescribed form or the situation must qualify as an instance of implied consent or other authorization set out in Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation, or CASL. The penalties for non-compliance under CASL are significant and the regulator, the Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission, is active with respect to enforcement. In addition, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, requires subject companies to implement and maintain comprehensive information privacy and security protections with respect to personal data (data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual) about persons in the E.U. that is collected or processed by such companies. The GDPR provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state, provincial and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, governmental standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our applications or platform. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our contractors to comply with federal, state, provincial or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in loss of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition, alteration, destruction, release or transfer of PII or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause employees, clients and consumers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability or perceived inability (even if unfounded) on our part to adequately address privacy, data protection, and information security concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, governmental standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, Canada, the E.U. and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, or amendments or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, could impair our or our clients\u2019 ability to collect, use, disclose or otherwise process information relating to employees or consumers, which could decrease demand for our applications, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our client and consumer bases and increase revenue. Such laws and regulations may require us to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use PII or other data for certain purposes. In addition, a foreign government could require that any data collected in a country not be transferred or disseminated outside of that country, or impose restrictions or conditions upon such dissemination, and we may face difficulty in complying with any such requirements for certain geographic regions. Indeed,\nmany privacy laws, such as those in force in Canada and the E.U., already impose these requirements. If we fail to comply with federal, state, provincial and foreign data privacy laws and regulations, our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals could be harmed. Furthermore, due to our acceptance of credit cards, we are subject to the PCI- DSS, which is designed to protect the information of credit card users.\nWe have had security incidents in the past, which we do not believe reached the level of a breach that would be reportable under applicable state laws or our other obligations; however, there can be no assurance that our determinations were correct. In the event our determinations are challenged and found to have been incorrect, we may be subject to unfavorable publicity or claims by one or more state attorneys general, federal regulators, or private plaintiffs, any of which could damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.\nGovernmental regulation of the internet continues to develop, and unfavorable changes could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal, state, provincial and foreign laws specifically governing the internet. Existing and future laws and regulations, narrowing of any existing legal safe harbors, or previous or future court decisions may impede the growth of the internet or online products and solutions, and increase the cost of providing online products and solutions. These laws may govern, among other issues, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of offerings. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet or online services. There is also a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways across jurisdictions, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may limit our business activities, expose us to potential legal claims or cause us to spend significant resources on ensuring compliance, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims brought against us as a result of content we provide.\nWe provide educational information regarding the use and potential effects of various types of cannabis products through our platform, including information regarding therapeutic uses for cannabis. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that consumers or others may sue us for various causes of action. Although our website and mobile applications contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers that provide the terms and conditions for use of our websites and mobile applications are unenforceable. A finding by a court that these agreements are invalid and that we are subject to liability could harm our business and require costly changes to our business.\nFor content that we publish or provide ourselves, we have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide. However, we cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, our business is based on establishing the reputation of our platform as trustworthy and dependable sources of educational information. Allegations of impropriety or inaccuracy, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation and business.\nWe may be subject to legal claims based on the content published to our platform.\nWe may be subject to legal claims relating to information made available through our platform, including claims for defamation, libel, negligence and copyright or trademark infringement, among others. These claims or allegations could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merits of the claims or allegations. In some instances, we may elect or be compelled to remove content, or may be forced to pay substantial damages or administrative monetary penalties, if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to defend against these claims or allegations. If we elect, or are compelled, to remove valuable content from our platform, our platform or services may become less useful to consumers, which could have a negative impact on our business and financial performance. This risk may also be greater in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States where our protections from such liability may be unclear.\nFuture investments in alternative revenue streams or acquisitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe believe that our long-term growth depends in part on our ability to develop and monetize additional aspects of our platform. Developing new products and solutions may involve significant investments of capital, time, resources and managerial attention. We have limited experience with developing, implementing and managing revenue streams other than our core listing business, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any new products or solutions. External factors, such as additional regulatory compliance obligations, may also affect the successful implementation of new products and solutions through our platform.\nAdditionally, we may make acquisitions that could be material to our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability as an organization to successfully acquire and integrate technologies or businesses is unproven. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:\n\u2022an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flows because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u2022we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us, and potentially across different cultures and languages in the event of a foreign acquisition;\n\u2022an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the company we acquired due to uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of products or support from either company;\n\u2022we may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;\n\u2022an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022potential known and unknown liabilities associated with an acquired company;\n\u2022if we incur debt to fund such acquisitions, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial maintenance covenants;\n\u2022the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets or goodwill in future acquisitions;\n\u2022to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity or convertible debt securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing equity holders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and\n\u2022managing the varying intellectual property protection strategies and other activities of an acquired company.\nWe may not succeed in addressing these or other risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business. The inability to integrate successfully the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any acquired business, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nIn the course of running our business, we may need to raise capital, certain forms of which may cause dilution to our stockholders. If our need is due to unforeseen circumstances or material expenditures or if our operating results are worse than expected, then we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and these additional financings could cause further dilution to our stockholders. Due to the current legal status of cannabis under U.S. federal law, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, difficulty attracting additional debt or equity financing. In addition, the current legal status of cannabis may increase the cost of capital now and in the future. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include equity conversion rights, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, expending capital, or declaring dividends, or that impose financial covenants on us that limit our ability to achieve our business objectives. Debt financings may contain provisions, which, if breached, may entitle lenders to accelerate repayment of loans, and there is no assurance that we would be able to repay such loans in such an event or prevent the foreclosure of security interests granted pursuant to such debt financing. If we need but cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, then we may not be able to meet our business objectives, our stock price may fall, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur business and operating results may be harmed if we are deemed responsible for the collection and remittance of state sales taxes or other indirect taxes for clients using our order functionality.\nWe do not collect sales and value-added tax as part of our client agreements in the United States or Canada, based on our determination that such tax is not applicable to our platform. Sales and use, value-added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. If we are deemed an agent for the clients on our platform under state or other applicable tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain states or jurisdictions. It is possible that one or more states could seek to impose sales, use or other tax obligations on us with regard to the ordering functionality that we offer our clients. These taxes may be applicable to past sales. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v.\nWayfair that a U.S. state may require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to the state\u2019s residents may permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements, which may increase the jurisdictions in which we may be required to collect and/or remit taxes. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use or other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states or other jurisdictions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and additional administrative expenses and increase the cost of our products and solutions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to potential adverse tax consequences both domestically and in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a result, we generally are not liable for U.S. federal or state and local income taxes in most jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to taxes, such as income, payroll, sales, use, value-added, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to various jurisdictional rules regarding the timing and allocation of revenue and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file and to changes in tax laws. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. From time to time, we may be subject to income and non-income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, audits may require ongoing time and attention from our management, which could limit their ability to focus on other aspects of our business and impact our business in the future.\nChanges in accounting standards or other factors could negatively impact our future effective tax rate.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for equity-based compensation, the impact of accounting for business combinations, changes in our international organization, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In addition, in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot ensure that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations and compliance in multiple jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or operating results.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, Canada, and several other foreign jurisdictions. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our U.S. and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and foreign business operations, and our business and financial performance. In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances, such as Section 280E of the Code, discussed below, could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. Furthermore, changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or operating results.\nRequirements as to taxation vary substantially among jurisdictions. Complying with the tax laws of these jurisdictions can be time consuming and expensive and could potentially subject us to penalties and fees in the future if we were to inadvertently fail to comply. If we were to inadvertently fail to comply with applicable tax laws, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in WMH LLC, and WMH LLC is accordingly dependent upon distributions made by its subsidiaries to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement and pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of Units and our managing member interest in WMH LLC. As a result, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. Our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement and pay dividends will depend on the financial results and cash flows of WMH LLC and its subsidiaries and the distributions we receive from WMH LLC. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of WMH LLC and its subsidiaries, for any reason could limit or impair WMH LLC\u2019s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and WMH LLC and/or any of its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or WMH LLC is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWMH LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, WMH LLC\u2019s taxable income will be allocated to holders of Units, including us. Accordingly, we will be required to pay income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income\nof WMH LLC. Under the terms of the amended operating agreement, WMH LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of Units (including us) calculated at certain assumed tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payment obligations under the tax receivable agreement (and the cost of administering such payment obligations), which could be significant. We intend to cause WMH LLC to make distributions to holders of Units in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes (calculated at assumed tax rates), relevant operating expenses, payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends, if any, declared by us. However, as discussed below, WMH LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which WMH LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering WMH LLC insolvent. If our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement and to fund our obligations, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to provide the liquidity needed to make such payments, which could materially adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the tax receivable agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the tax receivable agreement.\nAdditionally, although WMH LLC generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax, it may be liable under recent federal tax legislation for adjustments to its tax return, absent an election to the contrary. In the event WMH LLC\u2019s calculations of taxable income are incorrect, its members, including us, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this federal legislation and its related guidance.\nDividends on our Class A Common Stock, if any, will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors, which will consider, among other things, our business, operating results, financial condition, current and expected cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay such dividends. Financing arrangements may include restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders. In addition, WMH LLC is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of WMH LLC (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. WMH LLC\u2019s subsidiaries are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to WMH LLC. If WMH LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired.\nIn certain circumstances, WMH LLC will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of WMH Units, and the distributions that WMH LLC will be required to make may be substantial.\nAs discussed above, WMH LLC will generally be required from time to time to make pro rata distributions in cash to us and the other holders of WMH Units at certain assumed tax rates in amounts that are intended to be sufficient to cover the taxes on our and the other WMH equity holders\u2019 respective allocable shares of the taxable income of WMH LLC. As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and the other holders of WMH Units, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations than individuals and (iii) the use of an assumed tax rate (based on the tax rate applicable to individuals) in calculating WMH LLC\u2019s distribution obligations, we may receive tax distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the tax receivable agreement. We will determine in our sole discretion the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, dividends, the payment of obligations under the tax receivable agreement and the payment of other expenses. We will have no obligation to distribute such excess cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to the holders of Class A Common Stock. No adjustments to the redemption or exchange ratio of WMH Units for shares of Class A Common Stock will be made as a result of either (i) any cash dividend by us or (ii) any cash that we retain and do not distribute to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on Class A Common Stock and instead, for example, holds such cash balances or lends them to WMH LLC, WMH LLC equity holders would benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A Common Stock following a redemption or exchange of their WMH Units.\nWe will be required to pay the WMH LLC Class A equity holders and any other persons that become parties to the tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits we may receive and the amounts payable may be substantial.\nAcquisitions by us of common units in the Business Combination and future taxable redemptions or exchanges of Class A units representing limited liability company interests of WMH LLC (the \u201cClass A Units\u201d) by the WMH LLC equity holders for shares of Class A Common Stock or cash pursuant to the exchange agreement are expected to result in favorable tax attributes for us.\nUpon the Closing, we, the holder representative and the WMH Class A equity holders entered into the tax receivable agreement. Under the tax receivable agreement, we generally will be required to pay to the WMH LLC Class A equity holders, in the aggregate, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) increases to the tax basis of WMH LLC\u2019s assets resulting from acquisitions by us of common units for cash in the Business Combination and future taxable redemptions or exchanges of Class A Units for shares of Class A Common Stock or cash pursuant to the exchange agreement, (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest or (iii) tax attributes\nresulting from payments made under the tax receivable agreement. The payment obligations under the tax receivable agreement are our obligations and not obligations of WMH LLC.\nWe expect that the payments we will be required to make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. Assuming no material changes in relevant tax law, that there are no future redemptions or exchanges of Class A Units and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, the tax savings associated with acquisitions of common units in the Business Combination would aggregate to approximately $151.3 million over 15 years from the Closing Date. Under this scenario, we would be required to pay to the WMH LLC Class A equity holders approximately 85% of such amount, or $128.6 million, over the 15-year period from the Closing Date. The actual amounts we will be required to pay may materially differ from these hypothetical amounts, because potential future tax savings that we will be deemed to realize, and the tax receivable agreement payments made by us, will be calculated based in part on the market value of the Class A Common Stock at the time of each redemption or exchange under the exchange agreement and the prevailing applicable tax rates applicable to us over the life of the tax receivable agreement and will depend on us generating sufficient taxable income to realize the tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement. Payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned on the WMH LLC Class A equity holders\u2019 continued ownership of us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions we determine, and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or a part of the existing tax basis, tax basis increases, or other tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement, and a court could sustain such challenge. The parties to the tax receivable agreement will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such tax basis, or other tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that any excess payments made to a party under the tax receivable agreement will be netted against future payments otherwise to be made under the tax receivable agreement, if any, after the determination of such excess.\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that if (1) we breach any of our material obligations under the tax receivable agreement (including in the event that we are more than three months late making a payment that is due under the tax receivable agreement, except in the case of certain liquidity exceptions) (2) we are subject to certain bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, or (3) at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement (with respect to all Class A Units, whether or not such units have been exchanged or redeemed before or after such transaction) would accelerate and become payable in a lump sum amount equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the tax deductions, tax basis and other tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. The tax receivable agreement also provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination, or certain other changes of control, (x) our obligations under the tax receivable agreement with respect to Class A Units that have been exchanged or redeemed prior to or in connection with such change of control transaction would accelerate and become payable in a lump sum as described above and (y) with respect to Class A Units that have not been exchanged as of such change of control transaction, our or our successor\u2019s obligations under the tax receivable agreement would be based on certain assumptions, including that we or our successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits covered by the tax receivable agreement. As a result, upon any acceleration of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement (including upon a change of control), we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than 85% of our actual cash tax savings, which could negatively impact our liquidity. The change of control provisions in the tax receivable agreement may also result in situations where the WMH LLC Class A equity holders have interests that differ from or are in addition to those of the Class A equity holders.\nFinally, because we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to make payments under the tax receivable agreement depends on our ability to make distributions to it. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could negatively impact our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nAdditional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry\nCannabis remains illegal under federal law, and therefore, strict enforcement of federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to execute our business plan.\nCannabis, other than hemp (defined by the U.S. government as Cannabis sativa L. with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis), is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). Even in states or territories that have legalized cannabis to some extent, the cultivation, possession, and sale of cannabis all violate the CSA and are punishable by imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they aid and abet another in violating the CSA, or conspire with another to violate the law, and violating the CSA is a predicate for certain other crimes, including money laundering laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize the sale, possession and use of cannabis, even for individual medical purposes, regardless of whether it is legal under state law.\nFor over five years, however, the U.S. government has not prioritized the enforcement of those laws against cannabis companies complying with state law and their vendors. No reversal of that policy of prosecutorial discretion is expected under a Biden administration given his campaign\u2019s position on cannabis, and recent statements of Attorney General Merrick Garland discussed further below, although prosecutions against state-legal entities cannot be ruled out entirely at this time.\nOn January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the \u201cSessions Memo\u201d) rescinding certain past DOJ memoranda on cannabis law enforcement, including the Memorandum by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole (the \u201cCole Memo\u201d) issued on August 29, 2013, under the Obama administration. Describing the criminal enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions against those complying with state cannabis regulatory systems as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo gave federal prosecutors discretion not to prosecute state law compliant cannabis companies in states that were regulating cannabis, unless one or more of eight federal priorities were implicated, including use of cannabis by minors, violence, or the use of federal lands for cultivation. The Sessions Memo, which remains in effect, states that each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office should follow established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when deciding which cannabis activities to prosecute. As a result, federal prosecutors could and still can use their prosecutorial discretion to decide to prosecute even state legal cannabis activities. Since the Sessions Memo was issued over four years ago, however, U.S. Attorneys have generally not prioritized the targeting of state law compliant entities.\nWe cannot assure that each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in each judicial district where we operate will not choose to enforce federal laws governing cannabis sales against state-legal companies like our business clients. The basis for the federal government\u2019s lack of recent enforcement with respect to the cannabis industry extends beyond the strong public sentiment and ongoing prosecutorial discretion. Since 2014, versions of the U.S. omnibus spending bill have included a provision prohibiting the DOJ, which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Bluemnauer Amendment, and now known as the Joyce Amendment). In 2021, President Joe Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment included. On February 18, 2022, the amendment was renewed through a stopgap spending bill, with the most recent extension effective through March 11, 2022. There is no assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriations bills for future years.\nIn USA vs. McIntosh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. The court noted that, if the spending bill provision were not continued, prosecutors could enforce against conduct occurring during the statute of limitations even while the provision was previously in force. Other courts that have considered the issue have ruled similarly, although courts disagree about which party bears the burden of proof of showing compliance or noncompliance with state law. Our policies do not prohibit our state-licensed cannabis retailers from engaging in the cannabis business for adult use that is permissible under state and local laws. Consequently, certain of our retailers currently (and may in the future) sell adult-use cannabis, if permitted by such state and local laws now or in the future, and therefore may be outside any protections extended to medical-use cannabis under the spending bill provision. This could subject our clients to greater and/or different federal legal and other risks as compared to businesses where cannabis is sold exclusively for medical use, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement posture with respect to state licensed cannabis sales, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts where we operate, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses with respect to client base, which would adversely affect our operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nAdditionally, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended (the \u201cBank Secrecy Act\u201d). The penalties for violation of these laws include imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Prior to the DOJ\u2019s rescission of the Cole Memo, supplemental guidance from the DOJ issued under the Obama Administration directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. With the rescission of the Cole Memo, there is increased uncertainty and added risk that federal law enforcement authorities could seek to pursue money laundering charges against entities or individuals engaged in supporting the cannabis industry.\nFederal prosecutors have significant discretion and no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where we operate will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis production or distribution. Any change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement posture with respect to state-licensed cultivation of cannabis, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts where we operate, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses with respect to our investment in cannabis facilities in the United States. Furthermore, following any such change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement position, we could be subject to prosecution, which could lead to imprisonment and/or the imposition of penalties, fines, or forfeiture.\nWhile President Biden\u2019s campaign position on cannabis falls short of full legalization, he has campaigned on a platform of relaxing enforcement of cannabis proscriptions, including decriminalization generally. According to the Biden\ncampaign website: \u201cA Biden Administration will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes and reschedule cannabis as a CSA Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts. This will include allowing the VA to research the use of medical cannabis to treat veteran-specific health needs.\u201d He has pledged to \u201cdecriminalize\u201d cannabis, which could prompt his U.S. Attorney General to issue policy guidance to U.S. Attorneys that they should not enforce federal cannabis prohibition against state law compliant entities and others legally transacting business with them. Indeed, the Biden-Sanders Unity Platform, which was released at the time President Biden won the Democratic Party nomination for President, affirmed that his administration would seek to \u201c[d]ecriminalize marijuana use and legalize marijuana for medical purposes at the federal level;\u201d \u201callow states to make their own decisions about legalizing recreational use;\u201d and \u201cautomatically expunge all past marijuana convictions for use and possession.\u201d Vice President Harris echoed these intentions during the vice presidential debate, saying that \u201c[w]e will decriminalize marijuana and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana[-related offenses].\u201d While President Biden\u2019s promise to decriminalize likely would mean that the federal government would not criminally enforce the Schedule II status against state legal entities, and would expand opportunities for cannabis research in the U.S., the implications of the potential re-scheduling are not entirely clear for state legal commercial cannabis operators.\nAlthough the U.S. Attorney General could issue policy guidance to federal prosecutors that they should not interfere with cannabis businesses operating in compliance with states\u2019 laws, any such guidance would not have the force of law, and could not be enforced by the courts. The President alone cannot legalize medical cannabis, and as states have demonstrated, legalizing medical cannabis can take many different forms. While rescheduling cannabis to the CSA\u2019s Schedule II would ease certain research restrictions, it would not make the state medical or adult-use programs federally legal.\nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden formally nominated Merrick Garland to his cabinet as the U.S. Attorney General. Confirmation hearings for Attorney General Garland began on February 22, 2021. On the first date of his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Garland stated that he did not see enforcement of federal cannabis law as a high priority use of resources for the DOJ: \u201cThis is a question of the prioritization of our resources and prosecutorial discretion. It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a useful use. I do think we need to be sure there are no end-runs around the state laws that criminal enterprises are doing. So that kind of enforcement should be continued. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of our resources, where states have already authorized. That only confuses people, obviously, within the state.\u201d While the statement is not a promise to avoid federal interference with state cannabis laws, it does signal that the enforcement priorities of DOJ lie elsewhere.\nFurthermore, while industry observers are hopeful that a Democrat-controlled Senate, along with a Biden presidency, will increase the chances of federal cannabis policy reform, such as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (\u201cMORE Act\u201d), which was originally co-sponsored by now Vice President Harris in the Senate, or banking reform, such as the SAFE Banking Act, which passed the House of Representatives but has not yet passed the Senate, we cannot provide assurances about the content, timing or chances of passage of a bill legalizing cannabis. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing of any change in federal law or possible changes in federal enforcement. In the unlikely event that the federal government were to reverse its long-standing hands-off approach to the state legal cannabis markets and start more broadly enforcing federal law regarding cannabis, we would likely be unable to execute our business plan, and our business and financial results would be adversely affected.\nOur business and our clients are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws regarding financial transactions related to cannabis, which could subject our clients to legal claims or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe and our clients are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States regarding financial transactions. Violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) laws require proceeds from enumerated criminal activity, which includes trafficking in cannabis in violation of the CSA. Financial institutions that both we and our clients rely on are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by Title III of the USA Patriot Act. In Canada, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Criminal Code (Canada) apply. The penalties for violation of these laws include imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture.\nIn 2014, the DOJ under the Obama administration directed federal prosecutors to exercise restraint in prosecuting AML violations arising in the state legal cannabis programs and to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals based upon cannabis-related activity. Around the same time, the Treasury Department issued guidance that clarified how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses, consistent with financial institutions\u2019 obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Then-Attorney General Sessions\u2019s rescission of the DOJ\u2019s guidance on the state cannabis programs in early 2018 increased uncertainty and heighted the risk that federal law enforcement authorities could seek to pursue money laundering charges against entities, or individuals, engaged in supporting the cannabis industry. On January 31, 2018, the Treasury Department issued additional guidance that the 2014 Guidance would remain in place until further notice, despite the rescission of the DOJ\u2019s earlier guidance memoranda. A detailed description of current U.S. policy and the legal status of cannabis, including President Biden\u2019s stance on cannabis enforcement and current and foreseeable decriminalization and legalization initiatives, can be found in the \u201cU.S. and Territories\u201d section.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Canada and elsewhere that prohibit money laundering, including the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada) and the Money Laundering Control Act (U.S.), as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States, Canada or any other jurisdiction in which we have business operations or to which we export our offerings. If any of our clients\u2019 business activities, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenue accruing thereby are found to be in violation of money laundering statutes, our clients could be subject to criminal liability and significant penalties and fines. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, by our clients could disrupt our operations and involve significant management distraction and expenses. As a result, a significant number of our clients facing money laundering charges could materially affect our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, proceeds from our clients\u2019 business activities, including payments we have received from those clients, could be subject to seizure or forfeiture if they are found to be illegal proceeds of a crime transmitted in violation of anti-money laundering laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Finally, if any of our clients are found to be violating the above statutes, this could have a material adverse effect on their ability to access or maintain financial services, as discussed in detail below, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on our banking relations, and we may have difficulty accessing or consistently maintaining banking or other financial services due to our connection with the cannabis industry.\nAlthough we do not grow or sell cannabis products, our general connection with the cannabis industry may hamper our efforts to do business or establish collaborative relationships with others that may fear disruption or increased regulatory scrutiny of their own activities.\nWe are dependent on the banking industry to support the financial functions of our products and solutions. Our business operating functions including payroll for our employees and other expenses are handled which are reliant on traditional banking. Additionally, many of our clients pay us via wire transfer to our bank accounts, or via checks that we deposit into our banks. We require access to banking services for both us and our clients to receive payments in a timely manner. Lastly, to the extent we rely on any lines of credit, these could be affected by our relationships with financial institutions and could be jeopardized if we lose access to a bank account. Important components of our offerings depend on client accounts and relationships, which in turn depend on banking functions. Most federal and federally-insured state banks currently do not serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products on the stated ground that growing and selling cannabis is illegal under federal law, even though the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), issued guidelines to banks in February 2014 that clarified how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses, consistent with financial institutions\u2019 obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. While the federal government has generally not initiated financial crimes prosecutions against state-law compliant cannabis companies or their vendors, the government theoretically could, at least against companies in the adult-use markets. The continued uncertainty surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities and the subsequent risks this uncertainty presents to financial institutions may result in their discontinuing services to the cannabis industry or limit their ability to provide services to the cannabis industry or ancillary businesses providing services to the cannabis industry.\nAs a result of federal-level illegality and the risk that providing services to state-licensed cannabis businesses poses to banks, cannabis-related businesses face difficulties accessing banks that will provide services to them. When cannabis businesses are able to find a bank that will provide services, they face extensive client due diligence in light of complex state regulatory requirements and guidance from FinCEN, and these reviews may be time-consuming and costly, potentially creating additional barriers to financial services for, and imposing additional compliance requirements on, us and our clients. FinCEN requires a party in trade or business to file with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), a Form 8300 report within 15 days of receiving a cash payment of over $10,000. While we receive very few cash payments for the products we sell, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure that our strategies and techniques for designing our products and solutions for our clients will operate effectively and efficiently and not be adversely impacted by any refusal or reluctance of banks to serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products. A change in banking regulations or a change in the position of the banking industry that permits banks to serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products may increase competition for us, facilitate new entrants into the industry offering products or solutions similar to those that we offer, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Also, the inability of potential clients in our target market to open accounts and otherwise use the services of banks or other financial institutions may make it difficult for us to conduct business, including receiving payments in a timely manner.\nWe do not sell cannabis, or products that contain cannabis; accordingly, our company is not part of the cannabis industry that would be restricted from using federal and federally insured banks. However, because of \u201cweed\u201d in our name and the fact that our revenue is generated largely from companies licensed as operators in the cannabis industry, banks have and may continue to consider us to be part of the cannabis industry that is subject to banking restrictions. If we were to lose any of our banking relationships or fail to secure additional banking relationships in the future, we could experience difficulty and incur increased costs in the administration of our business, paying our employees, accepting payments from clients, each of which may adversely affect our reputation or results of operations. Additionally, the closure of many or one of our bank accounts due to a bank\u2019s reluctance to provide services to a business working with state legal cannabis businesses would require significant management attention from us and could materially adversely affect our business and operations. In addition to\nbanks and financial institutions, merchant processors may take a similar view of the risks of working with us since we provide services to cannabis businesses, and loss of any of our merchant processor relationships could have similar results. Moreover, Visa reportedly prohibits processing of transactions involving cannabis on its network, and Mastercard has reportedly stated that it is evaluating the inconsistency between U.S. state and federal cannabis law. In October 2020, we responded to an inquiry from certain of our merchant processors on behalf of Mastercard relating to the applicability of U.S. state and federal law to our services, including our WM Orders services. Although consumers cannot currently purchase products on the Weedmaps marketplace and we do not currently use, nor have we historically used, any of our merchant processing relationships to process payments for cannabis transactions, to the extent Visa or Mastercard extend these restrictions to cannabis-related businesses, our merchant processing relationships could be terminated, or we could be prevented from processing any Visa or Mastercard transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nParticipating in transactions involving proceeds derived from cannabis may constitute criminal money laundering.\nParticipating in transactions involving proceeds derived from cannabis may constitute criminal money laundering. It is a federal crime to engage in certain transactions involving the proceeds of a \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d (a \u201cSUA\u201d) when those transactions are designed to promote an underlying SUA, or conceal the source of the funds. Violations of the CSA and violations of a state\u2019s laws may be deemed to be SUAs. In the event that any of our investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues were found to be in violation of anti-money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of statutes of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions, or subsequently require us to repatriate such funds back to the United States from Canada or other foreign jurisdictions.\nIf any of our clients\u2019 business activities, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenue accruing thereby are found to be in violation of money laundering statutes, we and our investors could be subject to criminal liability and significant penalties and fines. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations and involve significant management distraction and expenses. Facing money laundering charges could materially affect our business, operations and financial condition. Additionally, proceeds from our clients\u2019 business activities, if found to be in violation of anti-money laundering laws, could subject payments we have received from those clients to seizure or forfeiture, if they are found to be illegal proceeds of a crime committed by a client, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our investors. Finally, if we or any of our clients are found to be violating the above statutes, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access or maintain financial services, as discussed in detail below, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may have difficulty using bankruptcy courts due to our involvement in the regulated cannabis industry.\nWe currently have no need or plans to seek bankruptcy protection. U.S. courts have held that debtors whose income is derived from cannabis or cannabis assets in violation of the CSA cannot seek federal bankruptcy protections. Although we are not in the business of growing or processing cannabis or selling or even possessing cannabis or cannabis products, a U.S. court could determine that our revenue is derived from cannabis or cannabis assets and prevent us from obtaining bankruptcy protections if necessary.\nThe conduct of third parties may jeopardize our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our systems, protocols, and practices will prevent all unauthorized or illegal activities by our clients. Our success depends in part on our clients\u2019 ability to operate consistently with the regulatory and licensing requirements of each state, local, and regional jurisdiction in which they operate. We have a dedicated Trust and Safety team that reviews cannabis license information for operational cannabis retail clients, both on submission and on an ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy. We require all operational cannabis retailer clients, including storefronts and delivery services, to display on their WMH listing a valid, unexpired state-issued license number. For certain of our products or services, we request additional verification and documentation. We cannot ensure that the conduct of our clients, who are third parties, and their actions could expose them to legal sanctions and costs, which would in turn, adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe conduct of third parties may jeopardize our regulatory compliance.\nWhile we are a technology company, not a cannabis licensee, and as such, are not subject to commercial cannabis regulations that apply to cannabis operators, we cannot guarantee that our systems, protocols, and practices will prevent any and all unauthorized or illegal activities by our clients. Our success depends in part on our clients\u2019 ability to operate consistently with the regulatory and licensing requirements of each state, local, and regional jurisdiction in which they operate. Despite the procedures and protocols in place for license verification by our Trust & Safety team, any non-compliance by our clients could put our business at risk, as discussed herein, and could also subject us to potential actions by state regulators, to the extent they could be applied to technology service providers, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, brand, and reputation.\nFDA regulation of adult-use and medical-use cannabis, as well as e-cigarettes and other vaping products, could negatively affect the cannabis industry, which would directly affect our financial condition.\nShould the federal government legalize cannabis for adult-use and/or medical-use, it is possible that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) would seek to regulate it under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938, as it has with federally legal hemp. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations including certified good manufacturing practices related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of adult-use and medical-use cannabis. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where adult-use and medical-use cannabis is grown register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations.\nIn addition, as a result of the recent lung injuries and deaths associated with e-cigarettes and other vaping products, the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the \u201cCDC\u201d) have warned consumers not to use vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d). While the FDA and the CDC continue to conduct ongoing investigations, it is currently unknown when and whether the FDA will impose additional rules and regulations on e-cigarettes and other vaping products.\nIn the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, we do not know what the impact would be on the adult-use and medical-use cannabis industry, including what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If our clients are unable to comply with any new rules, regulations or registration as prescribed by the FDA, or are unable to do so in a cost-effective manner, our clients may be unable to continue to operate their respective business in its current form, or at all, which may also result in our clients being unable to continue engaging our technology services.\nWe believe that Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act (\u201cCDA\u201d) provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability, but it is possible that it does not.\nWe believe that Section 230(c)(1) provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to internet service provider intermediaries in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. We do not create or develop the information that appears on our clients\u2019 listing pages and advertising placements, although our moderation teams may take down a client\u2019s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our site, such as WM News, WM Learn and WM Policy. All of these sections are general news and information, and none of these sections are advertisements for, or listing pages of, cannabis businesses, except in limited circumstances related to descriptions of certain cannabis strains. For additional information about Section 230, see the section captioned \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry.\u201d Our clients are subject to licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations, and our own compliance policies, and some of our clients currently and in the future may not be in compliance with all such requirements. Despite our belief that we are protected by Section 230, it is possible that we are not, which would subject us to legal, business, and operational risks. In addition, there have been various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the CDA, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, recently enacted legislation in Germany may impose significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations.\nWe may continue to be subject to constraints on marketing our products.\nCertain of the states in which we operate have enacted strict regulations regarding marketing and sales activities on cannabis products, which could affect our cannabis retail clients\u2019 demand for our listing and marketing services. There may be restrictions on sales and marketing activities of cannabis businesses imposed by government regulatory bodies that can hinder the development of our business and operating results because of the restrictions our clients face. If our clients are unable to effectively market our products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for our products for our clients, this could hamper demand for our products and services from licensed cannabis retailers, which could result in a loss of revenue.\nCannabis businesses are subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment.\nSection 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) does not allow any deduction or credit for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on business, other than costs of goods sold, if the business (or the activities which comprise the trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedules I and II of the CSA). The IRS has applied this provision to cannabis operations, prohibiting them from deducting expenses associated with cannabis businesses beyond costs of goods sold and asserting assessments and penalties for additional taxes owed. Section 280E may have a lesser impact on cannabis cultivation and manufacturing operations than on sales operations, which directly affects our clients, who are cannabis retailers. However, Section 280E and related IRS enforcement activity have had a significant impact on the operations of all cannabis companies. While the Section does not directly affect our Company, it lowers our clients\u2019 profitability, and could result in decreased demand for our listing and marketing services. An otherwise\nprofitable cannabis business may operate at a loss after taking into account its U.S. income tax expenses. This affects us because our sales and operating results could be adversely affected if our clients decrease their marketing budgets and are operating on lower profit margins as a result of unfavorable treatment by the Code.\nService providers to cannabis businesses may also be subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment.\nAs discussed above, under Section 280E of the Code, no deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on business, other than costs of goods sold, if the business (or the activities which comprise the trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedules I and II of the CSA). The IRS has applied this provision to cannabis operations, prohibiting them from deducting expenses associated with cannabis businesses and asserting assessments and penalties for additional taxes owed. While we do believe that Section 280E does not apply to our business, or ancillary service providers that work with state-licensed cannabis businesses, if the IRS interprets the section to apply, it would significantly and materially affect our profitability and financial condition. The MORE Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives but did not become law in the 116th Congress and has not yet been reintroduced into the 117th, would remove marijuana from the CSA, which would effectively carve out state-legal cannabis businesses from Section 280E of the Code.\nThe MORE Act would impose two new taxes on cannabis businesses: an excise tax measured by the value of certain cannabis products and an occupational tax assessed on the enterprises engaging in cannabis production and sales. Although these novel tax provisions are included in the MORE Act passed by the House of Representatives, it is challenging to predict whether, when, and in what form the MORE Act could be enacted into law and how any such legislation would affect our activities.\nCannabis businesses may be subject to civil asset forfeiture.\nAny property owned by participants in the cannabis industry used in the course of conducting such business, or that represents proceeds of such business or is traceable to proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture because of the illegality of the cannabis industry under federal law. Even if the owner of the property or the assets is never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture of assets of our cannabis business clients could adversely affect our revenues if it impedes their profitability or operations and our clients\u2019 ability to continue to subscribe to our services.\nDue to our involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial liability.\nInsurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, is more difficult for us to find and is more expensive or contains significant exclusions because our clients are cannabis industry participants. There are no guarantees that we will be able to find such insurance coverage in the future or that the cost will be affordable to us. If we are forced to go without such insurance coverage, it may prevent us from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit our growth, and may expose us to additional risk and financial liabilities. If we experience an uninsured loss, it may result in loss of anticipated cash flow and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and business.\nThere may be difficulty enforcing certain of our commercial agreements and contracts.\nCourts will not enforce a contract deemed to involve a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, parties to contracts involving the state legal cannabis industry have argued that the agreement was void as federally illegal or against public policy. Some courts have accepted this argument in certain cases, usually against the company trafficking in cannabis. While courts have enforced contracts related to activities by state-legal cannabis companies, and the trend is generally to enforce contracts with state-legal cannabis companies and their vendors, there remains doubt and uncertainty that we will be able to enforce our commercial agreements in court for this reason. We cannot be assured that we will have a remedy for breach of contract, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to Telephone Consumer Protections Act (TCPA) risks for our communications with consumers.\nOur acquisitions of Cannveya and Sprout will continue to put us directly into contact with consumers and their data. Additionally, we are exploring products for our WM Business customers that would permit them to directly contact consumers. The Telephone Consumer Protections Act (TCPA) restricts calls or text messages to cellphones made using an \u201cautomatic telephone dialing system\u201d without first obtaining the prior express consent of the called or texted party, in addition to other restrictions on contacting customers directly. Cannveya provides a means for our clients to communicate directly with their customers, and may expose us to potential lawsuits under the TCPA, if those third party clients do not adhere to TCPA restrictions. Even if the third party clients do adhere to the TCPA, we still run the risk of private lawsuits against us. While we have in place systems and policies for TCPA compliance, our direct communications with consumers (including on behalf of our clients) may put us at risk of a TCPA lawsuit.\nCertain of our directors, officers, employees and investors who are not U.S. citizens may face constraints on cross-border travel into the United States.\nBecause cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, non-U.S. citizens employed at or investing in companies doing business in the state legal cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with cannabis businesses. Entry to the United States happens at the sole discretion of the officers on duty of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d), and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the United States could also be grounds for U.S. border guards to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada\u2019s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of U.S. laws regarding controlled substances and because cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under U.S. federal law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or in Canada may affect admissibility to the United States. CBP updated its stated policy on October 9, 2018 to clarify that a Canadian citizen coming to the United States for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry will generally be admissible to the United States.\nAs a result, CBP has affirmed that employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to cannabis in the United States or Canada (such as us), who are not U.S. citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States for life. On October 9, 2018, CBP released an additional policy statement indicating that Canadian citizens working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in Canada, if travelling to the United States for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry, will generally be admissible. However, if the traveler is found to be entering into the United States for reasons related to the cannabis industry, he or she may be deemed inadmissible. Ultimately, travel restrictions imposed on our directors, officers, employees and investors could impair our ability to conduct business and to freely explore new strategic relationships.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our affiliates, executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates as a group beneficially own approximately 45.9% of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates specific courts as the exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against current or former directors, officers or other employees for breach of fiduciary duty, other similar actions, any other action as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any action or proceeding concerning the validity of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any state court located in the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Certificate of Incorporation also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This provision may limit our stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us and our directors, officers or other employees and may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers and other employees. Furthermore, our stockholders may be subject to increased costs to bring these claims, and the exclusive forum\nprovision could have the effect of discouraging claims or limiting investors\u2019 ability to bring claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable.\nIn addition, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in our Certificate of Incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable. In March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi, which found that an exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under Delaware law. We intend to enforce this provision, but we do not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or enforce it. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A Common Stock and the public warrants originally issued in the initial public offering of Silver Spike (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d).\nTo the extent our Warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales, or the potential sales, of substantial numbers of shares in the public market by the Selling Securityholders, subject to certain restrictions on transfer until the termination of applicable lock-up periods, could increase the volatility of the market price of our Class A Common Stock or adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of Class A Common Stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional shares of Class A Common Stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances of additional shares of Class A Common Stock or preferred stock:\n\u2022may significantly dilute the equity interests of our investors;\n\u2022may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A Common Stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u2022may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A Common Stock and/or Warrants.\nThe trading price of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants have been, and may continue to be, volatile, and the value of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants have been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 changes in projected operational and financial results;\n\u2022 the development, effects and enforcement of and changes to laws and regulations, including with respect to the cannabis industry;\n\u2022 the commencement or conclusion of legal proceedings that involve us;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures;\n\u2022 capital-raising activities or commitments;\n\u2022 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 the use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our financial performance;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 sales of our securities, including short selling of our securities;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from civil unrest, war, foreign invasions, terrorism, or public health crises, or responses to such events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets frequently experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, elections, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants. As a result of such fluctuations, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation or derivative litigation. For example, stockholders have filed or threatened to file derivative lawsuits, purportedly on our behalf, in the past and may do so in the future. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe impact of global, regional or local economic and market conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur performance is subject to global economic conditions and economic conditions in one or more of our key markets, which impact spending by our clients and consumers. A majority of our clients are small and medium-sized businesses that operate one or two retail locations, and their access to capital, liquidity and other financial resources is constrained due to the regulatory restrictions applicable to cannabis businesses. As a result, these clients may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns.\nClients may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our platform, especially during economic downturns. Economic conditions may also adversely impact retail sales of cannabis. Declining retail sales of cannabis could result in our clients going out of business or deciding to stop using our platform to conserve financial resources. Negative economic conditions may also affect third parties with whom we have entered into relationships and upon whom we depend in order to grow our business.\nFurthermore, economic downturns could also lead to limitations on our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all, reduced liquidity, decreases in the market price of our securities, decreases in the fair market value of our financial or other assets, and write-downs of and increased credit and collectability risk on our trade receivables, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business and impair our ability to provide our platform to clients and consumers, resulting in costs for remediation, client and consumer dissatisfaction, and other business or financial losses.\nOur operations depend, in part, on our ability to protect our facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. Despite precautions taken at our facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, spikes in usage volume or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our platform. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce revenue, subject us to liability and lead to decreased usage of our platform and decrease sales of our advertising placements, any of which could harm our business.\nWe will incur increased costs and administrative burden as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a public company, we are subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these\ncompliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs will increase our net loss. Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements will require us to carry out activities we have not done previously. For example, we created new board committees and adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies additional material weaknesses or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs it may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nOur employees and independent contractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other activities that violate laws and regulations, including production standards, U.S. federal and state fraud, abuse, data privacy and security laws, other similar non-U.S. laws or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A Common Stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease their coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if we have sufficient funds. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.", "PERMNO": 19025, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SSPK"}
