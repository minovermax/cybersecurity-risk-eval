RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business and operations may be materially and adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies. If the outbreak continues to spread, it may affect the Company\u2019s operations and those of third parties on which the Company relies, including causing disruptions in the supply of the Company\u2019s product candidates and the conduct of current and planned preclinical and clinical studies. We may need to limit operations or implement limitations, and may experience limitations in employee resources. There are risks that it may be more difficult to contain if the outbreak reaches a larger population or broader geography, in which case the risks described herein could be elevated significantly. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nAdditionally, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the coronavirus pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the coronavirus on the global financial markets may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to access capital, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term liquidity and the Company\u2019s ability to complete its preclinical studies on a timely basis, or at all. For instance, our preclinical and clinical may be temporarily delayed or paused, and the operations of our contracted third parties may be significantly delayed as well. The ultimate impact of coronavirus is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, financing or preclinical and clinical trial activities or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.\nOur product candidates are in an early stage of development and may fail or experience significant delays or may never advance to the clinic, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\nAll of our pipeline programs are in preclinical development and our future success heavily depends on the successful development of our INTASYL\u2122 product candidates, which may never occur. These product candidates could be delayed, not advance into the clinic or unexpectedly fail at any stage of development. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must conduct extensive preclinical and other non-clinical tests in order to support an IND application, including IND-enabling good laboratory practice (\u201cGLP\u201d) toxicology studies, in the United States or their equivalents with regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and can take many years. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop our product candidates, and we may focus our efforts and resources on product candidates that may prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe cannot be certain of the outcome of preclinical testing and clinical studies and results from these studies may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase trials of our product candidates. Even if we are able to complete our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials in line with our projected timelines, results from such studies and trials may be not replicated in subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trial results. Additionally, such studies may be delayed due to events beyond our control including as a result of natural disasters, epidemics or pandemic outbreaks such as the novel coronavirus. Further, the FDA, or equivalent regulatory authority, may not accept the results of our preclinical studies or proposed clinical study designs and may require the Company to complete additional preclinical studies or impose stricter approval conditions than we expect. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to submit INDs, or similar applications, within our projected timelines, if at all, or that the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities, will allow us to commence clinical trials.\nWe are dependent on collaboration partners for the successful development of our adoptive cell therapy product candidates.\nWe are not a cell company and expect to depend on third-party collaborators to support the clinical development of our ACT product candidates. We have entered into research agreements with our academic and industry collaborators, each of which is terminable by the relevant party at any time, subject to applicable notice periods. We may not be successful in negotiating agreements with these collaborators to continue the development and commercialization of our ACT product candidates through collaborations such as joint development or licensing agreements. Our ability to successfully negotiate such agreements will depend on, among other things, potential partners\u2019 evaluation of the superiority of our technology over competing technologies, the quality of preclinical data that we have generated, the perceived risks specific to developing our product candidates and our partners\u2019 own strategic and corporate objectives. If we fail to negotiate these agreements, we may not be able commence clinical trials with our ACT product candidates or we may be required to obtain licenses from third-party cell companies and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely upon third-party relationships to conduct preclinical studies, and any future clinical trials, for our product candidates and may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to support their development.\nWe depend upon third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), medical institutions, clinical investigators, consultants and other third parties to support our preclinical research efforts such as through managing and conducting research studies, formulating our product candidates and manufacturing our product candidates and expect to rely on the same for our future clinical trials. Because we rely on these third parties, we cannot necessarily control the timing, quality of work or amount of resources that our contract partners will devote to these activities and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements. Furthermore, we compete with many other companies for the resources of these third parties, some of which may be our competitors, and may detract from our programs. Additionally, our contracted CROs and other third parties we rely upon may be impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, resulting in delays or interruptions, If these third parties do not successfully carry out their responsibilities, as well as within a timely fashion, our preclinical and clinical development may be delayed, unsuccessful or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements with or maintain relationships with these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval(s) or commercialize our product candidates. The third parties whom we rely on generally may terminate their agreements with us at any time, subject to applicable notice periods, and we may not be able to readily terminate any such agreements with contract partners even if such partners do not fulfill their obligations to us. If we have to enter into alternative arrangements it may delay or adversely affect the development of our product candidates and our business operations.\nWe rely upon third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates.\nWe rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers to provide us with the materials and services to manufacture our INTASYL\u2122 compounds and product candidates for certain of our preclinical research and expect that we will rely on them for our future clinical trials. While we do have in-house expertise and capacity to manufacture our INTASYL\u2122 compounds, we do not own or lease manufacturing facilities or have our own supply source for the required materials. Accordingly, we will be dependent upon third party suppliers and our contract manufacturers to obtain supplies, and we will need to either develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturers for these supplies. If for any reason we are unable to obtain the supplies for our INTASYL\u2122 compounds from our current manufacturer, we would have to seek to obtain it from another major manufacturer. There is no assurance that we will be able to timely secure needed supply arrangements on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nAlthough we have used multiple contract manufacturers, we currently contract with only one manufacturer for the supply of our clinical product candidates. There is no assurance that our supply of our clinical drug product will not be limited, interrupted, of satisfactory quality or be available at acceptable prices. If for any reason we are unable to obtain the clinical supply of our product candidates from our current manufacturer, we would have to seek to contract with another major manufacturer. While we believe that we currently have sufficient supply of our PH-762 product candidate for our planned preclinical and clinical studies, some of our other product candidates or the materials contained therein, may come from facilities in areas impacted by the coronavirus, which may result in delays or shortages due to ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. Our failure to secure these arrangements as needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our clinical product candidates or, if we obtain regulatory approval, to commercialize them.\nThe FDA, or equivalent regulatory authority, governs the manufacturing process for product candidates and will inspect the facilities at which the product manufactured. Approval of the product will not occur unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations, or equivalent foreign authority. If our suppliers or manufacturers do not comply with the FDA or foreign regulations for our product candidates, we may experience delays in timing or supply, be forced to manufacture our product candidates ourselves or seek to enter contract with another supplier or manufacturer. If we are required to switch suppliers or manufacturers, we will be required to verify that the new supplier or manufacturer maintains facilities and processes in line with cGMP regulations, which may result in delays, additional expenses, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates.\nNatural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators or other third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future.\nA wide variety of events beyond our control, including natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks (such as the recent novel coronavirus outbreak), trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our manufacturers, regulatory authorities, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. These events may cause businesses and government agencies to be shut down, supply chains to be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. For example, Massachusetts recently ordered most businesses closed, mandating work-from-home arrangements, where feasible, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These limitations could negatively affect our business operations and continuity, and could negatively impact our development timelines and ability to timely perform basic business functions, including making SEC filings and preparing financial reports. If our operations or those of third parties with whom we have business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be impaired or halted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe approach we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using RNAi may never lead to marketable products.\nOur research and development efforts and our future success is based on our INTASYL\u2122 technology platform. We plan to develop our INTASYL\u2122 products for the treatment of cancer to be delivered via direct injection for use intratumorally and with ACT by isolating immune cells from patients, treating the cells ex vivo and then returning them to the patient for treatment. We believe that our INTASYL\u2122 compounds may offer a new treatment option to current standards of care, such as antibodies, and potentially with a more cost-effective approach. Successful development of our INTASYL\u2122 compounds by us, or by our collaborative partners, is highly uncertain and depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The scientific research used to support our efforts and approach to developing RNAi therapeutics is limited. Decisions made by the Company to advance the development of our pipeline, including those related to our technology or manufacturing processes, may show to be incorrect based on further work by us or our collaborators.\nThe use of RNAi is a relatively new scientific discovery and the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries, or INTASYL\u2122, is limited. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately predict challenges we may face with our product candidates as they move through the discovery, preclinical and clinical development stages. We may spend large amounts of money trying to develop our INTASYL\u2122 technology and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, our research methodology by be unsuccessful in identifying product candidates and results from preclinical and clinical studies may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase trials of our product candidates or our product candidates may interact with patients in unforeseen or harmful ways that may make it impractical to manufacture, market or receive regulatory approval. If we are not successful in bringing an INTASYL\u2122 product candidate to market, it could negatively impact our business and financial condition and we may not be able to identify and successfully implement an alternative product development strategy.\nA number of different factors could prevent us from advancing into clinical development, obtaining regulatory approval, and ultimately commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests and successful clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Before human clinical trials may commence, we must submit to the FDA an IND application. An IND application involves the completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other data in the IND submission. The FDA may require us to complete additional preclinical studies or disagree with our clinical trial study design. Also, animal models may not exist for some of the disease areas we choose to develop our INTASYL\u2122 product candidates for. As a result, our clinical trials may be delayed or we may be required to incur more expense than we anticipated.\nClinical trials require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Before our clinical trials can begin, we must also submit to the FDA a clinical protocol accompanied by the approval of the IRB at the institution(s) participating in the clinical trial. An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of our clinical trials, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval.\nClinical trials of a new drug candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of subjects, including subjects who are suffering from the disease or condition the drug candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of subject enrollment are affected by many factors, and delays in subject enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times.\nClinical testing is lengthy and expensive, and its outcome is highly uncertain. Historical failure rates are high due to number of factors, such as safety and efficacy of drug candidates. We, our collaborators, the FDA, or an IRB may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time for various reasons, including if we or they believe the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a drug candidate on subjects in a clinical trial could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspending or terminating the trial and refusing to approve a particular drug candidate for any or all indications of use.\nAn additional number of factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our drug development efforts, including the following:\n\u00b7 Delays in filing or acceptance of initial drug applications for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 Difficulty in securing centers to conduct clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Conditions imposed on us by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Problems in engaging IRBs to oversee trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB approval of studies;\n\u00b7 Difficulty in enrolling subjects in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u00b7 Third-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 Our drug candidates having unexpected and different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than in laboratory testing and interacting with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways;\n\u00b7 The need to suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 Insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our drug candidates or other necessary materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 Effects of our drug candidates not having the desired effects or including undesirable side effects or the drug candidates having other unexpected characteristics;\n\u00b7 The cost of our clinical trials being greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 Negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for similar drug candidates or inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u00b7 Changes in the FDA\u2019s requirements for testing during the course of that testing;\n\u00b7 The impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak;\n\u00b7 Reallocation of our limited financial and other resources to other clinical programs; and\n\u00b7 Adverse results obtained by other companies developing similar drugs.\nA failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these products may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. Preliminary observations made in early stages of clinical trials with small numbers of subjects are inherently uncertain and initial clinical trial results are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained when full data sets are analyzed or in subsequent clinical trials. Because of these factors, it is difficult to predict the time and cost of the development of our product candidates. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals may prevent us from completing our preclinical or clinical studies and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to initiate or commercialize any drug candidate on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside of the United States.\nWe are dependent on the success of our product candidates and even if we complete the necessary preclinical and clinical studies, we may not receive or be delayed in receiving regulatory approval and as a result, we will not be able to commercialize or will be delayed in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe have no commercial products and currently generate no revenue from product sales and may never be able to develop marketable products. The FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies must approve our products in development before they can be marketed. We, and any of our collaborators, must demonstrate and establish our product candidate\u2019s safety, purity and effectiveness to patients through extensive clinical trials before we can submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA for approval. Even if we complete the necessary preclinical and clinical studies, it is possible that none of the product candidates that we may attempt to develop will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals needed to begin selling them or they may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.\nThe process for obtaining FDA and other approval is both time consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome, and can often take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending on the complexity of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may deny our application, may decide our data is insufficient or require additional information from us regarding our current or planned clinical trials at any time, and such information may be costly to provide or cause potentially significant delays in development. Any changes in marketing approval policies or regulatory statutes and regulations during product development, trials and the review process, may cause delays in the approval of an application. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop any of our product candidates, and we may spend large amounts of money trying to resolve these issues and may never succeed in doing so.\nWe have no experience in filing the applications necessary to obtain marketing approval and expect that we and need to rely on CROs and regulatory consultants to assist us with this process. Regulatory approval also requires the submission about the product manufacturing process and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, to the relevant regulatory authority. Any product candidates we develop may not be effective, may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nIf we experience delays or fail to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates that we may develop, we would be prevented from being able to commercialize our product candidates and our commercial prospects and ability to generate revenues may be materially impaired.\nThe FDA could impose a unique regulatory regime for our therapeutics.\nThe compounds we intend to develop may represent a new class of drug, and even though the first RNAi therapeutic was approved in August 2018, the FDA has not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. While we expect any product candidates that we develop will be regulated as a new drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to regulate them or other products we may develop as biologics under the Public Health Service Act. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by defining requirements that we may not have anticipated.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, our product candidates may not be accepted commercially, which may prevent us from becoming profitable.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenues from sales of the product. The product candidates that we are developing are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches, which are largely unproven. Additionally, RNAi products do not readily cross the so-called blood brain barrier, are rapidly eliminated from circulating blood and, for various applications, are likely to require injection or implantation, which will make them less convenient to administer than drugs administered orally. Key participants in the pharmaceutical marketplace, such as physicians, medical professionals working in large reference laboratories, public health laboratories and hospitals, third-party payors and consumers may not accept products intended to improve therapeutic results based on our technologies. For example, RNAi products may be more expensive to manufacture than traditional small molecule drugs, which may make them costlier than competing small molecule drugs. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use our products or to provide favorable reimbursement. If medical professionals working with large reference laboratories, public health laboratories and hospitals choose not to adopt and use our technologies, our products may not achieve broader market acceptance.\nAdditionally, although we expect that we will have intellectual property protection for our technology, certain governments may elect to deny patent protection for drugs targeting diseases with high unmet medical need (e.g., as in the case of HIV) and allow in their country internationally unauthorized generic competition. If this were to happen, our commercial prospects for developing any such drugs would be substantially diminished in these countries.\nWe are dependent on technologies we license, and if we lose the right to license such technologies or fail to license new technologies in the future, our ability to develop new products would be harmed.\nMany patents in the fields we are pursuing have already been exclusively licensed to third parties, including our competitors. If any of our existing licenses are terminated, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses could be delayed or terminated and we may not be able to negotiate additional licenses on acceptable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights licensed from other parties; our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent third parties from using our technologies or developing competing products; and we may need to license additional intellectual property from others.\nTherapeutic applications of gene silencing technologies, formulations, delivery methods and other technologies that we license from third parties are claimed in a number of pending patent applications, but there is no assurance that these applications will result in any issued patents or that those patents would withstand possible legal challenges or protect our technologies from competition. The United States Patent and Trademark Office and patent granting authorities in other countries have upheld stringent standards for the RNAi patents that have been prosecuted so far. Consequently, pending patents that we have licensed and those that we own may continue to experience long and difficult prosecution challenges and may ultimately issue with much narrower claims than those in the pending applications. Third parties may hold or seek to obtain additional patents that could make it more difficult or impossible for us to develop products based on our technologies without obtaining a license to such patents, which licenses may not be available on attractive terms, or at all.\nIn addition, others may challenge the patents or patent applications that we currently license or may license in the future or that we own and, as a result, these patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which would negatively affect our ability to exclude others from using the technologies described in these patents. There is no assurance that these patent or other pending applications or issued patents we license or that we own will withstand possible legal challenges. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any patents issued to us or our licensors may not provide us with any competitive advantages, and there is no assurance that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. Our efforts to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights may not be successful and may result in substantial costs and diversion of management time. Even if our rights are valid, enforceable and broad in scope, competitors may develop products based on technology that is not covered by our licenses or patents or patent applications that we own.\nThere is no guarantee that future licenses will be available from third parties for our product candidates on timely or satisfactory terms, or at all. To the extent that we are required and are able to obtain multiple licenses from third parties to develop or commercialize a product candidate, the aggregate licensing fees and milestones and royalty payments made to these parties may materially reduce our economic returns or even cause us to abandon development or commercialization of a product candidate.\nOur success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies.\nThe applications based on RNAi technologies claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, delivery and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Because this field is so new, very few of these patent applications have been fully processed by government patent offices around the world, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about which patents will issue, when, to whom and with what claims. Although we are not aware of any blocking patents or other proprietary rights, it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference and opposition proceedings in various patent offices, relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. It is possible that we may become a party to such proceedings.\nWe are subject to significant competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including immuno-oncology, have intense competition and contain a high degree of risk. We face a number of competitors that have substantially greater experience and greater research and development capabilities, staffing, financial, manufacturing, marketing, technical and other resources than us, and we may not be able to successfully compete with them. These companies include large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations.\nIn addition, even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, in order to compete successfully we may need to be first to market or to demonstrate that our products are superior to therapies based on different technologies. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that are introduced to market earlier than our product candidates or on a more cost-effective basis. A number of our competitors have already commenced clinical testing of product candidates and may be more advanced than we are in the process of developing products. If we are not first to market or are unable to demonstrate superiority, on a cost-effective basis or otherwise, any products for which we are able to obtain approval may not be successful.\nOur competitors also compete with us in acquiring technologies complementary to our INTASYL\u2122 technology. We may face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, timing and scope of regulatory approvals, reimbursement coverage, price and patent position, including dominant patent positions of others. If we are not able to successfully obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to establish market share and generate revenues from our technology.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities from clinical testing and future product liability claims.\nIf any of our future products are alleged to be defective, they may expose us to claims for personal injury by subjects in clinical trials of our products. If our products are approved by the FDA, users may claim that such products caused unintended adverse effects. We will seek to obtain clinical trial insurance for clinical trials that we conduct, as well as liability insurance for any products that we market. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in the amounts we seek, or at all. We anticipate that licensees who develop our products will carry liability insurance covering the clinical testing and marketing of those products. There is no assurance, however, that any insurance maintained by us or our licensees will prove adequate in the event of a claim against us. Even if claims asserted against us are unsuccessful, they may divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and we may have to incur substantial costs to defend such claims.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf approved, we intend to sell our products primarily to hospitals, oncologists and clinics, which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Most third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, was used for an unapproved indication or if they believe the cost of the product outweighs its benefits. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, because our programs are still in development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost-effectiveness and the level or method of reimbursement for them. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe currently expect that any drugs we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician. Under currently applicable law, drugs that are not usually self-administered may be eligible for coverage by the Medicare program if:\n\u00b7 They are \u201cincidental\u201d to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u00b7 They are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standards of medical practice;\n\u00b7 They are not excluded as immunizations; and\n\u00b7 They have been approved by the FDA.\nInsurers may refuse to provide insurance coverage for newly approved drugs, including drugs in our clinical pipeline, or insurance coverage may be delayed or be more limited than the purpose for which the drugs are approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for insurance coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to develop products and our overall financial condition.\nAdditionally, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products. If our customers are not reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComprehensive healthcare reform legislation, which became law in 2010, and any revisions to this legislation, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Among other provisions, the legislation provides that a \u201cbiosimilar\u201d product may be approved by the FDA on the basis of analytical tests and certain clinical studies demonstrating that such product is highly similar to an existing, approved product and that switching between an existing product and the biosimilar product will not result in diminished safety or efficacy. This abbreviated regulatory approval process may result in increased competition if we are able to bring a product to market. The legislation also includes more stringent compliance programs for companies in various sectors of the life sciences industry with which we may need to comply and enhanced penalties for non-compliance with the new healthcare regulations. Complying with new regulations may divert management resources, and inadvertent failure to comply with new regulations may result in penalties being imposed on us.\nSome states and localities have established drug importation programs for their citizens, and federal drug import legislation has been introduced in Congress. The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan legislation, which became law in 2003, required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations for drug reimportation from Canada into the United States under some circumstances, including when the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States. The Secretary, however, retained the discretion not to implement a drug reimportation plan, if the Secretary finds that the benefits do not outweigh the costs, and has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nWith the current U.S. administration and Congress, there may be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drugs will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market drugs and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will remain subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that are reported after our drug products are made available to patients. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or vigilance required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug products will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with the product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the drug from the market. We would continue to be subject to the FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information for all of our product candidates, even those that the FDA had approved. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and other adverse consequences.\nIf we fail to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to design, develop, market or sell our products or successfully manage our business.\nOur business prospects are dependent on the principal members of our executive team, the loss of whose services could make it difficult for us to manage our business successfully and achieve our business objectives. While we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, they could leave at any time, in addition to our other employees, who are all \u201cat will\u201d employees. Our ability to identify, attract, retain and integrate additional qualified key personnel is also critical to our success. Competition for skilled research, product development, regulatory and technical personnel is intense, and we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need. The loss of the services of any key research, product development, regulatory and technical personnel, or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills, could restrict our ability to develop our product candidates.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing and may not be able to develop our product candidates.\nWe believe that our existing cash at December 31, 2019, and the proceeds received from our capital raises completed in February 2020, will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed. However, we have generated significant losses to date, have not generated any product revenue and may not generate product revenue in the foreseeable future, or ever. We expect to incur significant operating losses as we advance our product candidates through drug development and the regulatory process. In the future, we may need to issue equity or incur debt in order to fund our planned expenditures, as well as to make acquisitions and other investments. We cannot assure you that equity or debt financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we cannot, or are limited in the ability to, issue equity, incur debt or enter into strategic collaborations, we may be unable to fund the discovery and development of our product candidates, address gaps in our product offerings or improve our technology.\nWe anticipate that we will need to raise substantial amounts of money to fund a variety of future activities integral to the development of our business, which may include but is not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 To conduct research and development to successfully develop our technologies;\n\u00b7 To obtain regulatory approval for our products;\n\u00b7 To file and prosecute patent applications and to defend and assess patents to protect our technologies;\n\u00b7 To retain qualified employees, particularly in light of intense competition for qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 To manufacture products ourselves or through third parties;\n\u00b7 To market our products, either through building our own sales and distribution capabilities or relying on third parties; and\n\u00b7 To acquire new technologies, licenses or products.\nMoreover, the global coronavirus pandemic has led to significant uncertainty and increased volatility in the capital markets. If these conditions in the capital markets continue for an extended period of time it may impact our ability to raise capital. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we may ultimately be unable to continue to develop and potentially commercialize our product candidates, and we may be forced to scale back or terminate our operations or seek to merge with or be acquired by another company.\nFuture financing may be obtained through, and future development efforts may be paid for by, the issuance of debt or equity, which may have an adverse effect on our stockholders or may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation. In such event, there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled, there may be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of common stock. In addition, if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, whether through private placements or public offerings, such an issuance would dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership in us.\nThe terms of debt securities may also impose restrictions on our operations, which may include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock, or to make certain acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios, and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult for us to attain profitability, and may lead to uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe expend substantial funds to develop our technologies, and additional substantial funds will be required for further research and development, including preclinical testing and clinical trials of any product candidates, and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale. Because the successful development of our products is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate enough revenue, even if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable.\nIf we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to secure additional financing, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due, raising substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our common stockholders losing their entire investment. There is no guarantee that we will become profitable or secure additional financing. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to, or classification of, recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern. Changes in our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our expansion plans, increased expenses, potential acquisitions or other events will all affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock markets, in general, and the markets for drug delivery and pharmaceutical company stocks, in particular, have experienced extreme volatility, particularly in response to the coronavirus outbreak, that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could be extremely expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and the Company\u2019s resources.\nWe have issued preferred stock in the past and possibly may issue more preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. The issuance of our preferred stock could affect the rights of existing stockholders or reduce the value of our outstanding preferred stock or common stock. In particular, rights granted to holders of certain series of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that may be unsuccessful and could dilute your ownership interest in the Company.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other complementary businesses and technology licensing arrangements. We also may pursue strategic alliances. We have limited experience with respect to acquiring other companies and with respect to the formation of collaborations, strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to integrate such acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. We also could experience adverse effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition related charges, amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles and impairment charges relating to write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets from time to time following the acquisition. Integration of an acquired company requires management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license or strategic alliance. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing such assets, and a failure to successfully develop such assets could diminish our prospects.\nTo finance future acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock as consideration, which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders. Any future acquisitions by us also could result in large and immediate write-offs, the incurrence of contingent liabilities or amortization of expenses related to acquired intangible assets, any of which could harm our operating results.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings in the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u00b7 Authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 Prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7 Provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u00b7 Establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAlthough we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 14468, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PHIO"}
