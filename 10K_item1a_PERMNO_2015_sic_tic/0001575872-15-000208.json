{"cik": "772897", "company": "HUTCHINSON TECHNOLOGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or otherwise waived, or if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, then the Merger will not occur.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions. The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including (1) determination of the amount of Additional Consideration; (2) approval, by the requisite affirmative vote of our shareholders of (a) a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and (b) a proposal to increase the conversion rate of our 8.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201c8.50% New Convertible Notes\u201d) in connection with the Merger; (3) the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d); and (4) the absence of any law, order or injunction that prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger.\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions, including (1) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties (subject to certain qualifications), and (2) the other party\u2019s material compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement.\nParent\u2019s and Merger Subsidiary\u2019s obligations to consummate the Merger also are subject to satisfaction or waiver of additional conditions, including (1) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (2) if review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or the U.S. Department of the State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (the \u201cDDTC\u201d) shall have concluded, the President of the United States of America or the DDTC, as applicable, shall have not taken any action to block or prevent consummation of the Merger or imposed any requirements or conditions that have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (3) delivery by the company of customary payoff letters from holders of our outstanding indebtedness (other than capitalized lease obligations, the 8.50% New Convertible Notes, and our outstanding 8.50% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2017 and 10.875% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2017).\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both the company and Parent, including, among others, a mutual termination right and termination rights of either us or Parent, if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not consummated on or before November 1, 2016, if the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are legally prohibited, or if our shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement and the increase in the conversion rate of the 8.50% New Convertible Notes.\nThe company has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal subject to the other applicable terms of the Merger Agreement.\nIf any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger are not fulfilled or waived of if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, then the Merger may not occur.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of our management on the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board seeks another merger or business combination, shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration offered by the Merger Agreement.\nWe have agreed to reimburse Parent for up to $1.4 million of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby if the company terminates the Merger Agreement because shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement and the increase in the conversion rate of the 8.50% New Convertible Notes. Any such reimbursed expenses would be deducted from any termination fee that may subsequently be paid by the company to Parent. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including in the event of a termination by the company in order to accept a superior proposal, we have agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $4.2 million.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger remains pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or a desire not to remain with the business, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without the consent of Parent until the Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash or secure enough capital to service our existing debt obligations or execute our current and future business plans.\nSince 2009, we have experienced significant reductions in demand for and shipments of our suspension assemblies due primarily to our losses of market share resulting from supply chain realignments by our customers. Our operating results and cash flow from operations have been adversely affected by decreases in our demand. Our manufacturing capacity may continue to be underutilized in the future, which will negatively impact our operating results. Despite our workforce reductions and restructuring actions in recent years, we have continued to incur operating losses. Our unfavorable operating results have resulted in reduced cash flow from operations. Cash flow provided by operations was $18,765,000 for 2015, and cash flow used by operations was $1,474,000 for 2014. We will continue to have significant liquidity needs. Our outstanding $63,931,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2017 (the \u201c8.50% Secured Notes\u201d) mature on January 15, 2017. Our outstanding $12,200,000 aggregate principal amount of 10.875% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2017 (the \u201c10.875% Notes\u201d) also mature on January 15, 2017. Our outstanding $37,500,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.50% New Convertible Notes mature on October 31, 2019. Our term loan from PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC Bank\u201d) is payable in quarterly installments of $750,000 on the first day of each calendar quarter. As of September 27, 2015, we had $13,500,000 outstanding.\nA further deterioration in our business or disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related adverse economic conditions would impact our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our ability to obtain new financing. We may not be able to obtain new financing on terms acceptable to us, including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short-term. If cash flow from operations together with cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and debt obligations, and we are unable to secure alternative sources of financing, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nWe will need a significant amount of funds over the next several years to achieve our long-term growth objectives and to meet our debt obligations.\nOur business will require significant funds over the next several years. We would likely use these funds for capital expenditures, research and development, debt service and working capital. Our business is capital intensive. Our total capital expenditures were $17,940,000 in 2015, $17,283,000 in 2014 and $18,880,000 in 2013. In 2016, our capital expenditures are expected to be $10,000,000 to $15,000,000. In addition, our total research and development expenses were $22,100,000 or 9% of net sales, in 2015.\nWe have a revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC Bank\u201d). Our credit agreement with PNC Bank and the indentures governing our 8.50% Secured Notes and our 10.875% Notes each contain a number of financial covenants and other customary provisions. Our 8.50% Secured Notes and our 10.875% Notes mature in January 2017, and our 8.50% New Convertible Notes mature on October 31, 2019. Our term loan from PNC Bank is payable in quarterly installments of $750,000. We may pursue additional debt or equity financing or other forms of financing to supplement our current capital resources, if needed, in 2016 and beyond. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors, including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions. We may not be able to maintain adequate capital or raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all, if needed.\nThe following factors could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all:\n\u00b7 our results of operations;\n\u00b7 general economic and capital market conditions and conditions in the disk drive industry;\n\u00b7 our financial condition;\n\u00b7 our ratio of debt to equity;\n\u00b7 the perception in the capital markets of our business;\n\u00b7 our business prospects;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates; and\n\u00b7 our existing secured debt.\nOur ability to execute our long-term strategy may depend on our ability to obtain additional long-term debt and equity capital. We cannot determine the precise amount and timing of our funding needs at this time. We may be unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We also may need to refinance our indebtedness on a required repurchase date or at maturity. We may not be able to obtain additional capital on favorable terms to refinance our indebtedness or provide us with sufficient cash to serve our ongoing needs. An inability to refinance our indebtedness, if needed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe terms of our credit agreement with PNC Bank and the indentures governing the 8.50% Secured Notes and the 10.875% Notes may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Bank and the indentures governing our 8.50% Secured Notes and our 10.875% Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The agreements also require us to meet certain financial ratios and financial conditions tests. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to meet the financial ratios and financial condition tests described above or to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could require that we repay any borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance any borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFuture disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could limit our access to credit, which could negatively impact our business.\nDomestic and foreign credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruption, including volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declining valuations of certain investments and significant changes in the capital and organizational structures of certain financial institutions. We are unable to predict the likely timing, duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets or of any related adverse economic conditions. Given these conditions, we may not be able to secure additional financing for future activities on satisfactory terms, or at all, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit and security agreement with PNC Bank and our 8.50% Secured Notes and our 10.875% Notes are secured by substantially all of the personal and real property of Hutchinson Technology Incorporated. In addition, our credit agreement with PNC Bank and the indentures governing our 8.50% Secured Notes and our 10.875% Notes each contain a number of financial covenants and other customary provisions. Deterioration in our business or disruptions in the global credit and financial markets could result in reductions in our access to credit, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFuture disruptions in the global credit and financial markets also could adversely affect our customers and suppliers. Our customers and their customers may experience difficulty obtaining financing for significant purchases and operations. A resulting decrease in orders could decrease the overall demand for our products. It is also possible that our customers could demand adjustments in pricing terms or postpone or cancel existing orders as a result of limited credit availability. Furthermore, we maintain significant balances due from customers and limitations on the credit available to our customers could impair our ability to collect those receivables on a timely basis. If we were not able to enter into new independent bill of exchange discounting transactions, our working capital would be negatively impacted. If our suppliers, of either raw materials or equipment, experience similar credit restrictions, they may become unable to meet our ongoing supply demands or tighten the terms of our purchases. Disruptions in the global credit markets that adversely affect our customers and suppliers could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nA slowdown in demand for computer systems and consumer electronics and enterprise storage products may cause a decline in demand for suspension assemblies.\nOur suspension assemblies are components in computers and a variety of consumer electronics and enterprise storage products. The demand for these products can be volatile. In a weak economy, consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computer systems, other consumer electronics and enterprise storage products tends to decrease, as does business demand for computer systems. Demand for suspension assemblies therefore may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy. During the second half of 2012, overall disk drive production capacity recovered from the flooding in Thailand; however, hard disk drive demand weakened in the world market and has remained relatively flat. Previously, demand for suspension assemblies weakened significantly in 2009, which resulted in shipments of our suspension assemblies declining 30% from 2008. In addition, in the past, unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems, other consumer electronics and enterprise storage products have caused sharp declines in demand for suspension assemblies, resulting in periods during which the supply of suspension assemblies exceeded demand. If in the future an unexpected slowdown in demand for suspension assemblies occurs or if demand decreases as a result of a weakening economy, our results of operations will be materially adversely affected as a result of lower revenue and gross profits.\nOur sales are concentrated in a small customer base.\nAlthough we supply all manufacturers of disk drives and head-gimbal assemblers, sales to our four largest customers constituted 95%, 97% and 98% of net sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The failure by any one of our largest customers to pay its account balance with us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We currently enter into bill of exchange discounting transactions that enable us to reduce our balance of outstanding receivables. If we were not able to enter into new independent bill of exchange discounting transactions, our working capital would be negatively impacted.\nOver the years, the disk drive industry has experienced numerous consolidations. TDK Corporation controls MPT, a competitive suspension assembly supplier, and our customer SAE Magnetics (which is owned by TDK Corporation), is affiliated with a competitive supplier of suspension assemblies. In December 2011, Seagate Technology, LLC acquired the hard disk drive business of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. In March 2012, Western Digital Corporation completed its acquisition of HGST. We believe that consolidation in the disk drive industry has negatively impacted our competitive position and future consolidation could have a similar result.\nThe following factors could adversely impact our market share:\n\u00b7 change in supply chain alignment by a customer due to disk drive industry consolidation, strategic sourcing decisions or otherwise;\n\u00b7 loss of one or more of our disk drive industry customers;\n\u00b7 development by any one customer of the capability to produce suspension assemblies in high volume for its own products;\n\u00b7 loss of market share by one of our major customers; and\n\u00b7 change in the type of suspension assembly or flexures used in suspension assemblies, such as our TSA+ flexure, used by a customer.\nAny reduction in our market share could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manufacture our products efficiently due to changes in product mix or technology, or other unforeseen events.\nWe manufacture a wide variety of suspension assemblies with different selling prices and manufacturing costs. Disk drive makers continue to expand their product lines to include drives offering performance characteristics optimized for specific applications, which has resulted in a proliferation of individual disk drive programs. We cannot produce products for certain low-volume disk drive programs as efficiently as we produce products for high-volume programs. Our product mix varies as market demand changes. Any substantial variation in product mix can lead to changes in utilization of our equipment and tooling, inventory obsolescence and overstaffing in certain areas, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing yields, efficiencies and processing operations vary from product to product. Newer products often require new or additional manufacturing process steps and typically have lower initial manufacturing yields and efficiencies as we ramp up manufacturing. As a result, new products are frequently more expensive to produce and may not be profitable. We used new manufacturing processes to produce TSA+ suspension assemblies, which caused us to experience inefficiencies and lower yields in 2010 and 2011. We have experienced missed shipments and increased sales returns in the past as we ramp up manufacturing of new products, or as new features for our products are introduced, or as new manufacturing processes are implemented. In 2010, a defect in some of our TSA+ product resulted in decreased shipments. The measures we took to isolate and contain the product defect also reduced our yield, limited our output and increased our costs. We may in the future experience additional process issues that impact our ability to meet customer demand and cause us to incur higher costs. We also may in the future experience missed shipments or increased sales returns. In addition, we may be required to reimburse customers for product costs relating to the incorporation of defective suspension assemblies into our customers\u2019 products. We may not attain our output goals and be profitable with regard to any of our suspension assembly products.\nWe may need to transfer production of certain suspension assemblies from one manufacturing site to another. In 2011, we started high-volume assembly operations at our Thailand plant and we expect to continue to transfer assembly manufacturing to that location. In the past, transfers between our manufacturing sites have lowered initial yields and/or manufacturing efficiencies. This results in higher manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing plants located in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Thailand can experience severe weather. Severe weather has, at times, resulted in lower production and decreased our shipments.\nOur ability to conduct business could be impaired if our workforce were to be unionized and employees refused to work or if a significant number of our specialized employees were to leave and we could not replace them with comparable personnel. The locations of our plants and the broad span and technological complexity of our products and processes may limit the number of satisfactory engineering and other candidates for key positions. Our business may be adversely affected if we need to adjust the size of our workforce due to fluctuating demand. We significantly reduced our workforce in 2008, 2009 and 2011 and further restructured our business in each of the past four years. Past or future workforce reductions may impact our ability to recruit and retain employees, and we are uncertain if we will be able to adequately staff our operations if we need to increase our manufacturing capacity in the future.\nAlmost all of our sales depend on the disk drive industry, which is cyclical, subject to ongoing technological innovation and subject to intense price competition.\nSales of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components historically have accounted for 95% or more of our net sales. The disk drive industry is intensely competitive and technology changes rapidly, such as during past industry transitions to smaller disks or higher density read/write heads. The industry\u2019s demand for disk drive components also fluctuates. The disk drive industry experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction. These cycles may affect suppliers to this industry because we believe that it is a common practice for disk drive manufacturers to place orders for disk drive components in excess of their needs during growth periods, and sharply reduce orders for these components during periods of contraction. In addition, there is continuous downward price pressure on disk drive manufacturers and their suppliers. If price reductions exceed our ability to reduce costs, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nIndustry transitions in head technology and data density improvements impact demand for suspension assemblies. During past industry transitions, production yields of head and disk drive manufacturers initially were reduced. Because a significant portion of head yield reduction occurs after the head is bonded onto the suspension assembly, low yields at our customers often result in increased demand for suspension assemblies. When our customers improve their production yields, overall demand for our products may be negatively impacted. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if a reduction in the industry\u2019s component demand continues long-term or a future significant slowdown in the industry occurs.\nDemand for our suspension assemblies will decline if we are unable to qualify our products in disk drive programs.\nWe must qualify our products with our customers. The qualification process for disk drive products can be complex and difficult. We cannot be sure that our suspension assemblies will continue to be selected for design into our customers\u2019 products. If we are unable to obtain additional customer qualifications, or if we cannot qualify our products for high-volume production quantities, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our operating results.\nWe increase our production capacity and the overhead that supports production based on anticipated market demand. Market demand, however, has not always developed as expected or remained at a consistent level. The underutilization that can result decreases our profitability. For example, in 2010 and 2011 demand for our suspension assemblies declined, primarily due to market share losses. In 2012, the flooding in Thailand temporarily constrained the overall production capacity of the hard disk drive supply chain, which also resulted in a material decrease in our suspension assembly demand. This resulted in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity. As a result, our profitability also was below our expectations.\nA deterioration of our business could result in further underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and we may need to impair certain assets in the future. In 2009, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $71,809,000 for the impairment of long-lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our assembly and component operations. This impairment included the closure of our Sioux Falls, South Dakota facility at the end of June 2009. In 2012, we recorded flood-related costs of $20,360,000 for impairment of damaged facility equipment and fixtures, manufacturing equipment and tooling, inventory write-downs, and Thailand operating and site restoration costs. In 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $4,470,000 in connection with selling our Eau Claire, Wisconsin assembly building and again in 2015 when we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1,620,000 related to our Development Center building in Hutchinson, Minnesota that is currently offered for sale.\nThe following factors complicate accurate capacity planning for market demand:\n\u00b7 changes in the demand for and mix of specific products our customers buy and the features they require;\n\u00b7 our ability to add and train staff to operate our production equipment in advance of demand;\n\u00b7 the market\u2019s pace of technological change;\n\u00b7 variability in our manufacturing yields and productivity; and\n\u00b7 long lead times for most of our plant and equipment expenditures, requiring major financial commitments well in advance of actual production requirements.\nOur inability to plan our capacity requirements accurately and efficiently utilize our production capacity, or our failure to put in place the technologies and capacity necessary to meet market demand, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our customers improve their manufacturing yields, demand for our suspension assemblies may decrease.\nIn the past, we believe that improvements in our sales and unit volumes have occasionally been due in part to manufacturing difficulties experienced by our customers as they transitioned to higher density read/write heads. These customers experienced higher levels of defective read/write heads, which they were unable to detect until after they had attached the read/write heads to our suspension assemblies and our customers required more suspension assemblies during those periods. If our customers\u2019 production yields continue to improve in the future, or when they separate and re-use suspension assemblies or test the read/write head before attaching suspension assemblies, overall suspension assembly shipments could decline and our operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur investment in developing new process capabilities could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and may result in a product that is not acceptable to our customers.\nRapid technological change in the disk drive industry, as well as the expanding use of disk drives in a growing range of consumer electronics and enterprise storage applications, has led to numerous suspension assembly design changes and tighter performance specifications. To maintain our position in the disk drive industry, we need to develop new process capabilities to achieve the ever-increasing performance requirements of our customers. Also, if processes change, we may need to replace, modify or design, build and install equipment. These changes may require additional capital expenditures and increased development and support expenses, which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe expect to continue to have significant research and development expenses for the following new products:\n\u00b7 suspension assemblies that incorporate flexures produced using additive processing;\n\u00b7 suspension assemblies with tighter performance specifications than our customers currently require;\n\u00b7 suspension assemblies that require additional or smaller electrical conductors;\n\u00b7 suspension assemblies that incorporate new materials, such as thinner laminates and piezoelectric actuators used in DSA suspension assemblies, which are more difficult to handle in the manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 suspension assemblies for use with more complex read/write heads; and\n\u00b7 SMA OIS actuators for use in the smartphone camera market.\nWe have invested, and continue to invest, a substantial amount of engineering and manufacturing resources to develop process capabilities, as needed, to produce suspension assembly flexures and DSA suspension assemblies that meet the ever-increasing performance requirements of our customers. If high-volume manufacturing of our TSA+ suspension assemblies that are produced using additive processing capabilities cannot be produced profitably in the quantities and to the specifications required by our customers, we may need to purchase increased quantities of additive flexures. We may not be able to purchase the necessary quantity of such components on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe introduction of new process capabilities for our products also increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns, which may negatively impact our ability to bring products to market on time and at acceptable costs. When we started high-volume manufacturing of TSA+ suspension assemblies, we experienced higher cost due to yield loss, quality problems, startup and production inefficiencies and equipment problems. These TSA+ costs added a cost burden of approximately $30,400,000 in 2010, $32,000,000 in 2009 and $37,600,000 in 2008.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations.\nOur past operating results, and our gross profits, have fluctuated from period to period. We expect our future operating results and gross profits will continue to fluctuate from period to period. The following factors may cause these fluctuations:\n\u00b7 changes in overall demand for our products;\n\u00b7 changes in our manufacturing process, or problems related to our manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 changes in our manufacturing yields and related scrap recovery;\n\u00b7 increased costs when we start producing new products and features, and ramping up high-volume production;\n\u00b7 changes in our production efficiency;\n\u00b7 changes in utilization of existing or newly added production capacity;\n\u00b7 long disruptions in operations at any of our plants or our customers\u2019 plants for any reason;\n\u00b7 changes in our selling prices;\n\u00b7 changes in the specific products our customers buy and features they require;\n\u00b7 changes in our infrastructure costs and expected production and shipping costs, and how we control them;\n\u00b7 changes in the cost of, or limits on, available materials and labor; and\n\u00b7 currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the Thai baht.\nA deterioration of our business could result in further underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and we may need to impair certain assets in the future. In 2009, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $71,809,000 for the impairment of long-lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our assembly and component operations. If customer demand for suspension assemblies weakens, or if one or more customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, we may incur restructuring and asset impairment charges that would reduce our earnings, as we did in 2012, 2014 and 2015.\nWe typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice. We plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand. Our customers often prefer a dual source supply and, therefore, may allocate their demand among suppliers. Both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially. These factors, among others, create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary, leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace.\nOur selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers. Disk drive manufacturers seek low cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive. Our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products, changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product\u2019s life cycle. A typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature. To offset price decreases during a product\u2019s life, we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yields and efficiencies to reduce our cost. If we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products\u2019 life cycles, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to differentiate our product features or process capabilities in the future.\nWe historically held a market leadership position through innovation and technological advancement that has enabled our customers to deploy higher disk drive capacities at lower total costs. However, with the slowing of the areal density growth rate, the amount of technical innovation required to produce suspension assemblies also has decreased which has enabled our competitors to gain market share. If we can no longer differentiate our product features or process capabilities, competing suppliers may have access to a greater percentage of disk drive programs and program share. This inability to differentiate could be caused through our misunderstanding of market requirements, including technology changes, which could enable a competitor to take market share. The inability to differentiate our product offerings could also allow for supply chain alignments between our customers and other suppliers that could limit our access to available disk drive programs and corresponding market share. These alignments could include share agreements, sole-sourcing conditions or primary access to development programs. Any of the above scenarios could adversely impact our shipment volumes, average selling prices and operational costs.\nCompeting storage technology or reductions in demand for storage capacity may reduce demand for our products.\nOther types of data storage technology, such as solid state storage or flash (semiconductor) memory compete with certain disk drive applications and negatively impact the demand for our products. Lower capacity storage needs increasingly are being met by flash memory. If flash memory suppliers overcome both the technical and economic limitations of flash memory storage and can offer better performance or more competitive cost per unit of capacity than disk drive products for higher capacity storage needs, demand for disk drives, and thus for our products, may decrease. Additionally, consumers\u2019 demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow as expected as a result of how consumers store data, such as the emerging storage processes for cloud computing and storage virtualization. These factors, among others, could lead to lower capacity hard drives or solid state storage memory that could reduce demand for disk drive components, including our suspension assemblies. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the computer industry adopts technology that reduces or replaces disk drives as a computer data storage medium.\nIf the rate of data density improves at a significantly faster rate than the rate of increase in the demand for disk drive storage, demand for suspension assemblies may decrease.\nDisk drive manufacturers have been able to steadily increase data density, and we believe that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Increasing data density permits drive manufacturers to reduce the average number of disks in each disk drive, which in turn reduces the number of components they need per drive, including suspension assemblies. If improvements in data density outpace growth in data storage capacity requirements, demand for our suspension assemblies may decline and we may not be able to maintain or expand our suspension assembly business.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining an adequate supply of raw materials that meet our strict specifications at reasonable prices.\nCertain types of stainless steel, polyimide, adhesives, purchased flexures and photoresists are currently single-sourced because the raw materials provided by these sources meet our strict specifications. We have chosen to obtain certain other materials from a single or limited set of sources because of quality and pricing considerations. If we were not able to obtain an adequate supply of these materials from our current suppliers or if a current supplier were to exit the market, we could experience production delays and quality problems. Similarly, we obtain certain customized equipment and related repair parts from single sources because of the specialization of the equipment and the quality of these supply sources. We continue to look for options that may reduce our risk of supply disruption.\nThe price we pay for stainless steel periodically is reset and can fluctuate with changes in the value of the Japanese yen, which will impact our costs. The price we pay for gold and other precious metals has fluctuated in the past. We also have experienced increased expenses due to higher fuel costs related to freight and higher utility rates. During times of increased prices, we typically do not pass this higher price on to our customers. If we could not obtain the materials referred to above in the necessary quantities, with the necessary quality and at reasonable prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to achieve our financial and strategic goals in connection with investments in our assembly operation in Thailand.\nWe may fail to identify significant issues in connection with manufacturing in a foreign location, such as issues related to its infrastructure, workforce, quality or reporting systems, local tax, legal and financial controls or contingencies. Additionally, our operations in Thailand may be subject to various political, economic, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. Thailand has experienced political and civil unrest in the past and continued or future political or civil unrest in Thailand could adversely affect our ability to maintain operations in Thailand. From time to time, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have negatively affected our profitability and there can be no assurance that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our operations and profitability in the future. An inability to manage these risks as part of our investment in this manufacturing location could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe future success of our optical image stabilization actuator remains uncertain.\nWe have been developing an OIS actuator for use in a smartphone. This new product is in the early stages and volumes initially will be low. We face significant manufacturing challenges as we ramp our first production line to volume and we may not meet the market\u2019s product requirements, attain our manufacturing goals or achieve our cost targets. Our manufacturing process is capital intensive. We have very limited operating and marketing experience in the smartphone camera market. We do not know whether the product will generate sufficient revenue to offset expenditures related to product development and manufacturing start-up or become profitable. We do not know whether this product will be accepted by the market, the rate at which it will be accepted, if at all, or whether our product will be competitive with existing products already in the market or new technologies that may be introduced in the future. There can be no assurance that our investment in this new product line will not negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nNatural disasters in certain regions could adversely affect our supply chain or our customer base, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business, our ability to deliver or receive products and demand for our products.\nWe cannot be certain what impact the occurrence of natural disasters in certain regions, such as earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan or flooding in Thailand, may have on demand for our products or our ability to produce and supply our products to our customers and to what extent our customers could decrease or cancel orders. For example, the 2012 flooding in Thailand resulted in the suspension of manufacturing at our Thailand assembly facility, and also constrained hard disk drive production in the near-term, which resulted in a material decrease in demand for suspension assemblies in 2012. Any such occurrences could cause sales of suspension assemblies and hard disk drives to be negatively affected by disruptions in the hard disk drive or PC supply chain, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in the market price of our common stock could result in securities litigation claims against us.\nSignificant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of technology companies generally. In the past, securities litigation claims have been filed against certain companies following a period of decline in the market price of their publicly traded securities. We may be the target of similar securities litigation claims in the future. Risks associated with litigation often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Although we maintain director and officer insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured. Future litigation, if any, may result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations, and may be further limited by a \u201cchange of control.\u201d\nAt September 27, 2015, our deferred tax assets included $31,660,000 of unused tax credits, of which $2,907,000 can be carried forward indefinitely and $23,526,000 expire at various dates beginning in 2018, and $5,225,000 of various state tax credits expire at various dates beginning in 2016, including $539,000 that will expire in 2016.\nIn addition, at September 27, 2015, our deferred tax assets included $197,400,000 of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2021 if not otherwise used by us. As of September 27, 2015, we had an estimated NOL carryforward of $560,084,000 for United States federal tax return purposes.\nA valuation allowance of $239,912,000 has been recognized to offset the related deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets before they expire. Both our unused tax credits and our estimated NOL carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income, if any, generated by us in future years. Our ability to use these deferred tax assets is subject to an annual limitation imposed by certain change of control provisions under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that may be triggered by an aggregate change in the beneficial ownership of our common stock. If we do not generate sufficient profits or the annual limitation under Section 382 is triggered, some or all of our deferred tax assets may expire or we may not be able to use them to offset taxes due in the applicable period.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We may not, however, be able to obtain rights to protect our technology. In addition, competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently. Our ability to remain competitive depends in large part on trade secrets relating to our proprietary manufacturing processes. We seek to protect trade secrets and our other proprietary technology in part by requiring each of our employees to enter into non-disclosure, assignment and non-competition agreements. In these agreements, the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all of our proprietary information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment. In addition, we regularly enter into non-disclosure agreements with third parties, such as consultants, strategic suppliers and customers. These agreements may, however, be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our competitors may otherwise learn or independently develop our trade secrets.\nWe believe that the patents we hold and may obtain are valuable, but that they will not independently determine our success. Moreover, we may not receive patents for our pending patent applications, and our issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology adequately. Our future technology may not be protected, and any patent issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or infringed. In addition, we have only limited patent rights outside the United States, and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIn the past, we have entered into licensing and cross-licensing agreements relating to certain of our patents and patent applications allowing some of our competitors to produce products similar to ours in return for royalty payments and/or cross-license rights. The agreements also include cross-licenses to certain existing and future suspension assembly technology. These agreements are renegotiated as needed.\nWe and certain users of our disk drive industry products have received, and may receive, communications from third parties asserting patents against us or our customers that may relate to certain of our manufacturing equipment or to our products or to products that include our products as a component. Some of our competitors have experience with, and have developed patent portfolios relating to, technology associated with our TSA+ product. In addition, we and certain of our customers have been sued on patents having claims closely related to products we sell. If any third party makes a valid infringement claim against us and we are unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As the number of patents issued in connection with our disk drive industry business continues to increase, the volume of intellectual property claims made against us could increase. We may need to engage in litigation to:\n\u00b7 enforce patents issued or licensed to us;\n\u00b7 protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us; or\n\u00b7 determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our intellectual property rights or the rights of others.\nIn the past, we have litigated claims against a competitive disk drive industry supplier alleging infringement of our patents. We could incur substantial costs in other such litigation or other similar legal actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88795, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "HTCH"}
