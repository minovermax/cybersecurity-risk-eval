Risk Factors\nImportant risk factors that could cause results or events to differ from current expectations are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development and results of the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\nThe Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in Latin American Markets.\nThe Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, where business operations are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales. The Company\u2019s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective subsidiary\u2019s functional currency. While the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of the Company\u2019s Latin American subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the Latin American currencies could cause significant fluctuations in the value of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity and operating results. In addition, while expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, the Company has transaction exposure to the extent expenditures are incurred in currencies other than the respective subsidiary\u2019s functional currency. The costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions also may increase as a result of adverse currency rate fluctuations. In addition, changes in currency rates could negatively affect customer demand, especially in Latin America and in U.S. stores located along the Mexican border. The average value of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate for fiscal 2016 was 18.7 to 1, compared to 15.8 to 1 in fiscal 2015 and 13.3 to 1 in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2017, through February 20, 2017, the average exchange rate was 21.0 to 1, which equates to a 12% decline as compared to the average value for fiscal 2016 of 18.7 to 1. The average value of the Guatemalan quetzal to the U.S. dollar exchange rate for fiscal 2016 was 7.6 to 1, compared to 7.7 to 1 in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2017, through February 20, 2017, the average exchange rate was 7.5 to 1, which equates to a 1% increase as compared to the average value for fiscal 2016 of 7.6 to 1. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the United States and Latin America. If changes in regulations affecting the Company\u2019s pawn, credit services and consumer loan businesses create increased restrictions, or have the effect of prohibiting loans in the jurisdictions where the Company offers these products, such regulations could materially impair or reduce the Company\u2019s pawn, credit services and consumer loan businesses and limit its expansion into new markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the United States and Latin America. The Company faces the risk that restrictions or limitations on loan products, loan amounts, loan yields, loan fees and customer acceptance of loan products resulting from the enactment, change, or interpretation of laws and regulations in the United States or Latin America could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business activities. Both consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, pawn transactions, have come under increased scrutiny and increasingly restrictive regulation in recent years. Other enacted or recently proposed regulatory activity may limit the number of loans that customers may receive or have outstanding and require the Company to offer an extended payment plan to its customers, and regulations adopted by some states require that all borrowers of certain loan products be listed on a database, limit the yield on pawn or consumer loans and limit the number of such loans borrowers may have outstanding. Certain consumer advocacy groups and federal and state legislators have also asserted that laws and regulations should be tightened so as to severely limit, if not eliminate, the availability of pawn, consumer loans and credit services products to consumers. It is difficult to assess the likelihood of the enactment of any unfavorable federal or state legislation or local ordinances, and there can be no assurance\nthat additional legislative or regulatory initiatives will not be enacted that would severely restrict, prohibit, or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nIn Latin America, restrictions and regulations affecting the pawn and consumer loan industries, including licensing restrictions, customer identification requirements, suspicious activity reporting, disclosure requirements and limits on interest rates and/or loan service fees, have been and continue to be proposed from time to time. Adoption of such federal, state or local regulation or legislation in the United States and Latin America could restrict, or even eliminate, the availability of pawn and consumer finance at some or all of the Company\u2019s locations, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe extent of the impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes will depend on the political climate, the nature of the legislative or regulatory change, the jurisdictions to which the new or modified laws would apply, and the amount of business the Company does in that jurisdiction. Moreover, similar actions by states or foreign countries in which the Company does not currently operate could limit its opportunities to pursue its growth strategies. A more detailed discussion of the regulatory environment and current developments and risks to the Company is provided in \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nMedia reports, statements made by regulators and elected officials and public perception in general of pawnshop and consumer loan operations, including payday advances or pawn transactions, as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s pawn, consumer loan and credit services businesses. In recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports, in both the United States and Latin America, have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on consumer loans, including payday advances and pawn services.\nReports and statements made by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media, regulators and elected officials often focus on the annual or monthly cost to a consumer of consumer loans and pawn transactions, which are generally higher than the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with better credit histories. These reports and statements typically characterize pawn and/or consumer loans as predatory or abusive or focus on alleged instances of pawn operators purchasing or accepting stolen property as pawn collateral. If the negative characterization of these types of transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for pawn and/or consumer loan products could significantly decrease, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions becomes increasingly accepted by legislators and regulators, the Company could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services in the U.S., and it could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe CFPB has been exercising its supervisory review over certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of consumer loans such as the Company. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits CFPB examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar lenders, such as the Company, and ask questions about their business practices. The CFPB\u2019s examination procedures include specific modules for examining marketing activities, loan application and origination activities, payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers, collection practices, accounts in default and consumer reporting activities as well as third-party relationships. As a result of these examinations of non-bank providers of consumer credit, the Company could be required to change its practices or procedures, whether as a result of another party being examined or as a result of an examination of the Company, or could be subject to monetary penalties, which could adversely affect the Company. Under certain circumstances, the CFPB may also be able to exercise regulatory authority over providers of pawn services.\nIn addition to having the authority to obtain monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules), the CFPB can require remediation of practices, including through memorandums of understanding and consent orders, pursue administrative proceedings or litigation and obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that the Company has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations or any consent orders or memorandums of understanding instituted by the CFPB or state regulators against the Company, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nSee \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d for a further discussion of the regulatory authority of the CFPB.\nPROFECO has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over pawn operators in Mexico, and it could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nFederal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by PROFECO, Mexico\u2019s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO requires all pawn operators like the Company to register its pawn stores, pawn contracts and to disclose the interest rate and fees charged on pawn and consumer loan transactions. PROFECO also regulates the form and terms of pawn contracts and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops and establishes reporting requirements.\nIn January 2013, federal legislation conveyed additional regulatory authority to PROFECO regarding the pawn industry and national registration process. The 2013 legislation requires all pawn businesses and their owners to annually register with and be approved by PROFECO in order to legally operate. In addition, all operators must comply with additional customer notice and disclosure provisions, bonding requirements to insure against loss or insolvency, reporting of certain types of suspicious transactions and monthly reporting to state law enforcement officials of certain transactions (or series of transactions) of suspicious transactions. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to register and/or comply with PROFECO\u2019s rules and regulations. PROFECO continues to implement its process regarding its registration requirements, and the Company has complied in all material respects with this ongoing process and registration requirements as administered by PROFECO.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nGovernments at the national, state and local levels, may seek to impose new laws, regulatory restrictions or licensing requirements that affect the Company\u2019s products or services it offers, the terms on which it may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations it must fulfill in connection with its business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to continue its current methods of operation or to expand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of the Company\u2019s current business activities in certain jurisdictions, or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue.\nIn July 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense published a finalized set of new rules under the Military Lending Act (\u201cMLA\u201d). The MLA (and rules previously adopted thereunder) have previously prevented the Company from offering its short-term unsecured credit products to members of the military or their dependents because none of the Company\u2019s short-term unsecured credit products carry a military annual percentage rate of 36% or less. The new rules, which went into effect October 3, 2016, expand the scope of the credit products covered by the MLA to include certain non-purchase money loans secured by personal property, such as pawn loans, or vehicles and certain unsecured installment loan products to the extent any of such products have a military annual percentage rate greater than 36%. Under the new rules, the Company is unable to offer any of its current credit products, including pawn loans, to members of the U.S. military or their dependents. While the Company does not believe that active members of the U.S. military or their dependents comprise a significant percentage of the historical customer base in most locations, compliance with the MLA, and the new rules in particular, is complex and increases compliance risks and related costs. The Company continues to assess the impact of these new rules on its business operations and compliance requirements.\nOn June 1, 2016, the CFPB issued its notice of proposed rulemaking related to short-term consumer loans. The proposed rules are expected to become effective 15 months after the rules are finalized. The proposed rules seek to establish an ability to repay assessment on all covered loans, verification by the consumer of certain debts and verification through outside sources by lenders of certain debts, mandatory cooling off periods, alternative loan offerings that would allow lenders to forego the proposed requirement to conduct an ability to repay assessment, and restrictions on collection practices. As written, the proposed rules define the Company\u2019s consumer loan products, both short-term loans and installment loans, as loans covered under the rules, but excludes pawn loans. The Company continues to review the proposed rules to determine the potential impact on its consumer loan portfolio if the proposed rules become final in their current form. On a consolidated basis, the Company expects consumer loan revenue for the year ending December 31, 2017 to account for approximately 5% of the Company\u2019s consolidated total revenue.\nDeclines in commodity market prices of gold and other precious metals and diamonds could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely impacted by gold market fluctuations. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 57% of the Company\u2019s pawn loans were collateralized with jewelry, which is primarily gold, and 49% of its inventories consisted of jewelry, which is also primarily gold. The Company sells significant quantities of gold, other precious metals and diamonds acquired through collateral forfeitures or direct purchases from customers. In addition to normal market risks associated with accepting gold as loan collateral and buying and selling gold, current global economic conditions have increased the volatility of\ncommodity markets such as those for gold and other precious metals. A significant and sustained decline in gold and/or other precious metal prices could result in decreased merchandise sales and related margins, decreased inventory valuations and sub-standard collateralization of outstanding pawn loans. In addition, a significant decline in market prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the Company, as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry or other gold items. For a detailed discussion of the impact of a decline in market prices on wholesale scrap jewelry sales, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks and uncertainties related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had 955 store locations in Latin America, including 909 in Mexico, 33 in Guatemala and 13 in El Salvador. All of these are countries in which there are potential risks related to geo-political events, political instability, corruption, economic volatility, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social and ethnic unrest including riots and looting, enforcement of property rights, governmental regulations, tax policies, foreign investment policies, public safety and security, anti-money laundering regulations and import/export regulations among others. As in many developing markets, there are also uncertainties as to how both local law and U.S. federal law is applied, including areas involving commercial transactions and foreign investment. As a result, actions or events could occur in Mexico, Guatemala or El Salvador that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, which could restrict or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to operate some or all of its locations in these countries or significantly reduce customer traffic, product demand and the expected profitability of such operations.\nChanges impacting U.S. international trade and corporate tax provisions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause international operations increase the complexity of an organization, the Company may face additional administrative costs in managing its business. In addition, most countries typically impose additional burdens on non-domestic companies through the use of local regulations, tariffs, labor controls and other federal or state requirements or legislation. As the Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, primarily in Mexico, there are some inherent risks regarding the overall stability of the trading relationship between Mexico and the U.S. and the burdens imposed thereon by any changes to (or the adoption of new) regulations, tariffs or other federal or state legislation. Specifically, the Company has significant exposure to fluctuations and devaluations of the Mexican peso and the health of the Mexican economy, which, in each case, may be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. trade treaties (such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d)) and corporate tax policy, including the imposition of a tax on imports from countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, which includes countries such as Mexico. In particular, the current president has indicated that NAFTA and future import taxes are under scrutiny by his administration and that NAFTA may be renegotiated and new import taxes imposed with respect to imports from Mexico and other countries in which the U.S. runs a trade deficit. In some cases, there have been negative reactions to the proposed policies as expressed in the media and by politicians in Mexico, which could potentially impact U.S. companies operating in Mexico. While the Company engages in limited cross-border transactions other than those involving scrap jewelry sales, any such changes in regulations, trade treaties, corporate tax policy, import taxes or adverse court or administrative interpretations of the foregoing could adversely and significantly affect the Mexican economy and ultimately the Mexican peso, which could adversely and significantly affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of the Company\u2019s Latin America operations.\nIn addition, foreign countries may impose additional burdens on non-domestic companies through the use of local regulations, tariffs, labor controls and other federal or state requirements or legislation that could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs in these foreign jurisdictions. International operations also increase the complexity of an organization, and, as a result, the Company may face additional administrative costs in managing its business as compared to other companies in the Company\u2019s industry with only domestic operations.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses for credit services and consumer loans may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nMany of the Company\u2019s consumer loan and pawn stores offer a fee-based CSO Program through which the Company assists customers in applying for short-term extensions of credit from Independent Lenders. When an extension of credit is granted, the Company provides a guarantee to the Independent Lenders for the repayment of the customer\u2019s extension of credit. The Company records the estimated fair value of the guarantee liability in accrued liabilities. The Company also has customer loans arising from its consumer loan operations. The Company is required to recognize losses resulting from the inability of credit services and consumer loan customers and/or borrowers to repay such receivables or loans. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover credit losses inherent in its consumer loan operations. Additional credit losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has experienced to date. The allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates of material\nfactors that may be susceptible to significant change, especially in the event of a change in the governmental regulations that affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate new loans or collect outstanding loans. If the Company\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, its current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio, which could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nThe failure or inability of third-parties who provide products, services or support to the Company to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt Company operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s credit services operations depend, in part, on the willingness and ability of the Independent Lenders to make extensions of credit to its customers. The loss of the relationship with these lenders, and an inability to replace them with new lenders, or the failure of the lenders to fund new extensions of credit and to maintain volumes, quality and consistency in its loan programs could cause the Company to lose customers and substantially decrease the revenue and earnings of the Company\u2019s credit services business. In addition, the Company\u2019s lending, pawn retail, scrap jewelry and cash management operations are dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to maintain retail banking relationships with commercial banks. Recent actions by federal regulators in the U.S. and other Latin American countries where the Company operates have caused many commercial banks, including certain banks used by the Company, to cease offering such services to the Company and other companies in the Company\u2019s industry. The Company also relies significantly on outside vendors to provide services such as financial transaction processing (including foreign exchange), utilities, store security, armored transport, precious metal smelting, data and voice networks, and other information technology products and services. The failure or inability of any of these third-party lenders, financial institutions or vendors to provide such services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business and could increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations if the Company is unable to timely replace them with comparable service providers at a comparable cost.\nAn inability to disburse consumer loan proceeds or collect consumer loan payments through the ACH system would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s consumer loan business.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer loan businesses, including loans made through the CSO Program, depend all or in part on the ACH system to collect amounts due to the Company by withdrawing funds from its customers\u2019 bank accounts when the Company has obtained written authorization to do so from its customers. The Company\u2019s ACH transactions are processed by banks, and if these banks cease to provide ACH processing services to the Company, the Company would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of its consumer loan business if alternative ACH processors are not available.\nIt was reported that actions by the Department of Justice, the FDIC and certain state regulators appear to be discouraging banks, non-bank providers, and ACH payment processors from providing access to the ACH system (e.g. debiting/crediting consumer accounts) for certain short-term consumer loan providers that they believe are operating illegally. The heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Department of Justice, the FDIC and other state and federal regulators has the potential to cause banks and ACH payment processors to cease doing business with consumer lenders who are operating legally, without regard to whether that lender is complying with applicable laws, simply to avoid the risk of heightened scrutiny or even unwarranted litigation. In addition, the National Automated Clearing House Association (\u201cNACHA\u201d) adopted certain operating rules that govern the use of the ACH system (\u201cRules\u201d). Changes to the Rules were effective in 2015 and 2016. For example, some of the Rules add more options for which NACHA may begin an initial investigation or enforcement proceeding when an entity originates an excessive number of unauthorized entries. This could result in increased investigations of originator activity, and could ultimately result in fines passed on to those originators. Other portions of the Rules establish acceptable guidelines for certain returns of an originator. Return rates that exceed these guidelines may trigger an inquiry and review process by NACHA and the engagement of an industry review panel to evaluate the facts behind an originator's ACH activity. The evaluation could also result in a Rules violation or a Rules enforcement proceeding. Lastly, the NACHA Rules now formally define the types of entries that may be reinitiated, and those that are prohibited from reinitiation, among other notable changes.\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s access to the ACH system will not be impaired as a result of this heightened scrutiny or the NACHA rule amendments. If this access is impaired, the Company\u2019s consumer loan business could be materially adversely affected and the Company may find it difficult or impossible to continue some or all of its consumer loan business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects and results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased competition from banks, credit unions, internet-based lenders, other short-term consumer lenders, and other entities offering similar financial services, as well as retail businesses that offer products and services offered by the Company, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s principal competitors are other pawnshops, consumer loan companies, internet-based lenders, consumer finance companies, rent-to-own stores, retail finance programs, payroll lenders, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that serve the Company\u2019s primary cost conscious and underbanked customer base. Many other financial institutions or other businesses that do not now offer products or services directed toward the Company\u2019s traditional customer base, many of whom may be much larger than the Company, could begin doing so. Significant increases in the number and size of competitors for the Company\u2019s business could result in a decrease in the number of consumer loans or pawn transactions that the Company writes, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings in these categories. Furthermore, the Company has many competitors to its retail operations, such as retailers of new merchandise, retailers of pre-owned merchandise, other pawnshops, thrift shops, online retailers, online classified advertising sites and online auction sites. Increased competition or aggressive marketing and pricing practices by these competitors could result in decreased revenue, margins and turnover rates in the Company\u2019s retail operations. In Mexico, the Company competes directly with certain pawn stores owned by government affiliated or sponsored non-profit foundations. The government could take actions that would harm the Company\u2019s ability to compete in the Mexico market.\nA sustained deterioration of economic conditions or an economic crisis could reduce demand or profitability for the Company\u2019s products and services and increase credit losses which would result in reduced earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial results may be adversely impacted by sustained unfavorable economic conditions or unfavorable economic conditions associated with a global or regional economic crisis which, in either case, include adverse changes in interest or tax rates, effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions and increased volatility of commodity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. Specifically, a sustained or rapid deterioration in the economy could cause deterioration in the performance of the Company\u2019s loan portfolios and in consumer or market demand for pre-owned merchandise or gold such as that sold in the Company\u2019s pawnshops. A sustained deterioration in the economy could reduce the demand and resale value of pre-owned merchandise and reduce the amount that the Company could effectively lend on an item of collateral. Such reductions could adversely affect pawn book balances, pawn redemption rates, inventory balances, inventory mixes, sales volumes and gross profit margins. An economic slowdown also could result in a decrease in loan demand and an increase in loan defaults on consumer loan and credit services products. During such a slowdown, the Company could be required to tighten its underwriting standards, which would reduce consumer loan balances and related revenue and credit services fees, and could face more difficulty in collecting defaulted consumer loans, which could lead to an increase in loan losses. As consumer loans and credit services customers generally have to be employed to qualify for a loan or extension of credit, an increase in the unemployment rate would reduce the number of potential customers.\nA decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and the failure of the Company to adapt to such decreases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s products and services are a staple of its customer base, the demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, such as the availability and pricing of competing products, changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions as a result of changes in unemployment levels, fuel prices or other events, real or perceived loss of consumer confidence or regulatory restrictions that increase or reduce customer access to particular products. Should the Company fail to adapt to a significant change in its customers\u2019 demand for, or regulatory access to, its products, the Company\u2019s revenue could decrease significantly. Even if the Company does make adaptations, customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product change on the results of the Company\u2019s business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time. In particular, the Company has changed, and will continue to change, some of the consumer loan products and services it offers due to regulatory developments. Demand may also fluctuate by geographic region. The current geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s stores creates exposure to local economies and regional downturns (see \u201c-Item 1. Business-Locations and Operations\u201d for store concentration by state). As a result, the business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and the Company is vulnerable to economic downturns in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nChanges in the capital markets or the Company\u2019s financial condition could reduce availability of capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe Company has, in the past, accessed the debt capital markets to refinance existing debt obligations and to obtain capital to finance growth. Efficient access to these markets is critical to the Company\u2019s ongoing financial success; however, the Company\u2019s future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, regulatory restrictions or overall business or industry prospects, a significant deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward the Company\u2019s industry by market participants. Inability to access the credit markets on acceptable terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and ability to fund future growth.\nThe Company's existing and future levels of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial health, its ability to obtain financing in the future, its ability to react to changes in its business and its ability to fulfill its obligations under such indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, including the Company's 6.75% senior notes issued in March 2014 (\u201cNotes\u201d) and the Company\u2019s two current credit facilities, the Company had outstanding principal of $460.0 million and availability of $144.0 million under its credit facilities. The Company's level of indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for it to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and its other indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to refinance indebtedness or cause the associated costs of such refinancing to increase;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to the Company, which could limit its ability to, among other things, make required payments on its debt;\n\u2022\nincrease the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations (because a portion of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest); and\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to other companies with proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns.\nAny of the foregoing impacts of the Company's level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of the Company\u2019s facilities, systems and business functions, including its information technology and other business systems.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends highly upon its employees\u2019 ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions such as operating, managing and securing its retail locations, technical support centers, call centers, security monitoring, treasury and accounting functions and other administrative support functions. Additionally, the Company\u2019s storefront operations depend on the efficiency and reliability of the Company\u2019s point-of-sale system. A shut-down of or inability to access the facilities in which the Company\u2019s online operations, storefront point-of-sale and loan management system and other technology infrastructure are based, such as due to a power outage, a security breach, a failure of one or more of its information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair its ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to perform efficient storefront lending and merchandise disposition activities, provide customer service, perform collection activities, or perform other necessary business functions.\nSecurity breaches, cyber attacks or fraudulent activity could result in damage to the Company\u2019s operations or lead to reputational damage.\nA security breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems could interrupt or damage its operations or harm its reputation. In addition, the Company could be subject to liability if confidential customer or employee personal and identifying information is misappropriated from its computer systems. Any compromise of security, including security breaches perpetrated on persons with whom the Company has commercial relationships, that result in the unauthorized release and use of its users\u2019 personal information or the unauthorized access of confidential Company information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws,\nsignificant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, which could harm its business. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the Company\u2019s systems and could harm relationships with the Company\u2019s suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Actual or anticipated cyber attacks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. Despite the implementation of significant security measures, these systems may still be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks.\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers provide personal information in three ways: (1) when conducting a pawn transaction or selling merchandise; (2) during a consumer loan transaction (when personal and bank account information is necessary for approving this transaction); and (3) when conducting a retail purchase whereby a customer\u2019s payment method is via a credit card, debit card or check. The Company relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account and other personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by the Company to protect transaction data being breached or compromised.\nIn addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services, or support to the Company could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact the Company\u2019s customers and its business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue.\nJudicial or administrative decisions, CFPB rule-making or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d) could render the arbitration agreements the Company uses illegal or unenforceable.\nThe Company includes dispute arbitration provisions in many of its customer loan agreements. These provisions are designed to allow the Company to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court. The Company\u2019s arbitration provisions explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of mitigating class and collective action liability. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements do not have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. The Company takes the position that the FAA requires enforcement, in accordance with the terms of its arbitration agreements, of class and collective action waivers of the type the Company uses.\nIn the past, a number of state and federal circuit courts, including the California and Nevada Supreme Courts, and the National Labor Relations Board concluded that arbitration agreements with class action waivers are \u201cunconscionable\u201d and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis. In April 2011, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion that the FAA preempts state laws that would otherwise invalidate consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers. In December 2015, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia upheld DIRECTV\u2019s service agreement that included a binding arbitration provision with a class action waiver, and declared that the arbitration clause at issue was governed by the FAA. The Company\u2019s arbitration agreements differ in some respects from the agreement at issue in Concepcion and DIRECTV and some courts have continued, in the aftermath of Concepcion, to find reasons to rule that arbitration agreements are unenforceable.\nIn 2016, the CFPB proposed new federal regulations prohibiting mandatory arbitration provisions in contracts which bar class action lawsuits. The proposed rules would still allow arbitration provisions, though they would need to specify that the consumer is not precluded from participating in a class action lawsuit. After receiving comments on the proposed rules, the CFPB is developing a final rule expected to be published sometime in 2017. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any CFPB rule prohibiting or limiting arbitration of disputes would apply to arbitration agreements entered into more than six months after the final rule becomes effective (and not to prior arbitration agreements). The rules would also require companies that choose to use arbitration clauses for individual disputes to submit to the CFPB the arbitration claims filed and awards issued so that the bureau can monitor the fairness of the process. The CFPB is also considering publishing the claims and awards on its website so that the public can monitor them.\nIn light of conflicting court decisions and the CFPB\u2019s pending rules, it is possible that the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements will be rendered unenforceable. Additionally, Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory dispute arbitration in consumer contracts, and it has adopted such prohibitions with respect to certain mortgage loans and certain consumer loans to active-duty members of the military and their dependents.\nAny judicial or administrative decision, federal legislation or CFPB rule that would impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers could significantly increase the Company\u2019s exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff friendly jurisdictions. Such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to goodwill impairment risk.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had $831.2 million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet, all of which represents assets capitalized in connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions and business combinations. Accounting for goodwill requires significant management estimates and judgment. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying values of goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill to become impaired. A write-down of the carrying value of goodwill could result in a non-cash charge, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nDue primarily to the impacts of recently enacted and additional proposed local, state and federal regulatory restrictions affecting short-term and long-term profitability expectations for consumer loans, including payday and title lending products, the Company\u2019s long-term ongoing strategy to reduce non-core consumer lending operations along with significant deterioration in payday lending market conditions, the Company recorded a $7.9 million goodwill impairment charge during fiscal 2015 related to the U.S. consumer loan operations reporting unit. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has no remaining goodwill or other intangible assets associated with its U.S. consumer loan operations reporting unit.\nThe Company depends on its senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company depends on its senior management. The loss of services of any of the members of the Company\u2019s senior management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business until a suitable replacement can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and the Company cannot ensure that it would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nThe inability to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets and integrate completed acquisitions could adversely affect results.\nThe Company has historically grown, in part, through strategic acquisitions, including the addition of 815 stores as a result of the Merger and the acquisition of 182 other stores during 2016. The Company\u2019s strategy is to continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities if and when they become available. The success of an acquisition is subject to numerous internal and external factors, such as the ability to consolidate information technology and accounting functions, the management of additional sales, administrative, operations and management personnel, overall management of a larger organization, competitive market forces, and general economic factors. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees, or other third-parties or the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and could harm its financial performance. Failure to successfully integrate an acquisition could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and failure to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets and complete such acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s growth. Additionally, any acquisition has the risk that the Company may not realize a return on the acquisition or the Company\u2019s investment.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings, both in the U.S. and Latin America, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company or its subsidiaries has been or may be involved in future lawsuits, regulatory or administrative proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders, memorandums of understanding or other actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to consumer protection, federal or state wage and hour laws, product liability, unclaimed property, employment, personal injury and other matters that could cause it to incur substantial expenditures and generate adverse publicity. In particular, the Company may be involved in lawsuits or regulatory actions related to employment, marketing, unclaimed property and other matters, including class action lawsuits brought against it for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state wage and hour laws, state or federal advertising laws, consumer protection, lending, unclaimed property and other laws. The consequences of an adverse ruling in any current or future litigation, judicial or administrative proceeding, including consent orders or memorandums of understanding, could cause the Company to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties, fines, and/or modify or terminate\nthe Company\u2019s operations in particular states. Defense of any lawsuit or administrative proceeding, even if successful, could require substantial time and attention of the Company\u2019s management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits or administrative proceedings may also result in significant payments and modifications to the Company\u2019s operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, administrative proceedings and other claims, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such matters.\nAdverse court and administrative interpretations of the various laws and regulations under which the Company operates could require the Company to alter the products that it offers or cease doing business in the jurisdiction where the court, state or federal agency interpretation is applicable. The Company is also subject to regulatory proceedings, and the Company could suffer losses from interpretations of state or federal laws in those regulatory proceedings, even if it is not a party to those proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could impair the Company\u2019s ability to continue current operations. Besides regulation specific to consumer lending, which is discussed previously, the Company\u2019s pawn, credit services and consumer loan businesses are subject to other federal, state and local regulations, tax laws and import/export laws, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Act, Unfair Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices, Federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z adopted thereunder, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, Military Lending Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, USA PATRIOT Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. In addition, the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and the representations the Company makes about its products and services are subject to federal and state unfair and deceptive practice statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission Act and analogous state statutes under which the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general or private plaintiffs may bring legal actions. If the Company is found to have engaged in an unfair and deceptive practice, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company sells products manufactured by third parties, some of which may be defective. Many such products are manufactured overseas in countries which may utilize quality control standards that vary from those legally allowed or commonly accepted in the U.S., which may increase the Company\u2019s risk that such products may be defective. If any products that the Company sells were to cause physical injury or injury to property, the injured party or parties could bring claims against the Company as the retailer of the products based upon strict product liability. In addition, the Company\u2019s products are subject to the federal Consumer Product Safety Act and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect consumers from hazardous products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be hazardous. Similar laws exist in some states and cities in the U.S. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safety standards, the Company may be subject to claims, lawsuits, product recalls, fines and negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the Company\u2019s U.S. stores sell firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, which may be associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. The Company may incur losses due to lawsuits relating to its performance of background checks on firearms purchases as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by the Company, including lawsuits by individuals, municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover damages or costs from firearms retailers relating to the misuse of firearms. Commencement of such lawsuits against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is also subject to similar applicable laws and regulations in Mexico. For example, Mexico\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering Law (effective in November 2013), which requires monthly reporting of certain transactions (or series of transactions) exceeding monetary limits, and require stricter maintenance of customer identification records and controls, and reporting of all foreign (non-Mexican) customer transactions. The Company is also subject to the terms and enforcement of the Federal Personal Information Protection Act (\u201cPrivacy Law\u201d) (effective January 2012), which requires companies to protect their customers\u2019 personal information, among other things such as mandatory disclosures.\nCertain state and local governmental entities in Latin America also regulate pawn, other consumer finance and retail businesses through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. State and local agencies, including local police authorities, often have unlimited, broad and discretionary authority to suspend store operations pending investigation of suspicious pawn transactions and resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations is costly, can affect operating results and may result in operational restrictions. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject it to regulatory enforcement actions, result in the assessment against the Company of civil, monetary, criminal or other penalties, require the Company to refund interest or fees, result in a determination that certain loans are not collectible, result in a revocation of licenses, or cause damage to its\nreputation, brands and customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sale and ownership of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories is subject to current and potential regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company sells firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, the Company is required to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the purchase, storage, transfer and sale of such products. These laws and regulations require the Company, among other things, to ensure that each pawn location offering firearms has its FFL, that all purchasers of firearms are subjected to a pre-sale background check, to record the details of each firearm sale on appropriate government-issued forms, to record each receipt or transfer of a firearm and to maintain these records for a specified period of time. The Company is also required to timely respond to traces of firearms by law enforcement agencies. Over the past several years, the purchase, sale and ownership of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories has been the subject of increased federal, state and local regulation. These regulatory efforts are likely to continue in the Company\u2019s current markets and other markets into which the Company may expand. If enacted, new laws and regulations could limit the types of licenses, firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories that the Company is permitted to purchase and sell and could impose new restrictions and requirements on the manner in which the Company offers, purchases and sells these products. If the Company fails to comply with existing or newly enacted laws and regulations relating to the purchase and sale of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories, its licenses to sell or maintain inventory of firearms at its stores may be suspended or revoked, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, new laws and regulations impacting the ownership of firearms and ammunition could cause a decline in the demand for and sales of the Company\u2019s products, which could materially adversely impact its revenue and profitability. Complying with increased regulation relating to the sale of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories could be costly.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with these anti-corruption laws could result in penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although the Company has policies and procedures designed to ensure that it, its employees, agents, and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect the Company against liability for actions taken by its employees, agents, and intermediaries with respect to its business or any businesses that it may acquire. In the event the Company believes, or has reason to believe, its employees, agents, or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the Company may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. The Company\u2019s continued operation and expansion outside the United States, especially in Latin America, could increase the risk, perceived or otherwise, of such violations in the future. If the Company violates the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), the Company may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Investigation of any potential or perceived violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain certain criteria required by state and local regulatory bodies could result in fines or the loss of the Company\u2019s licenses to conduct business.\nMost states and many local jurisdictions both in the United States and in Latin America in which the Company operates, as well as the federal governments in Latin America, require registration and licenses to conduct the Company\u2019s business. These states or their respective regulatory bodies have established criteria the Company must meet in order to obtain, maintain, and renew those licenses. For example, many of the states in which the Company operates require it to meet or exceed certain operational, advertising, disclosure, collection, and recordkeeping requirements and to maintain a minimum amount of net worth or equity. From time to time, the Company is subject to audits in these states to ensure it is meeting the applicable requirements to maintain these licenses. Failure to meet these requirements could result in various fines and penalties or store closures, which could include temporary suspension of operations, the revocation of existing licenses or the denial of new and renewal licensing requests. The Company cannot guarantee future license applications or renewals will be granted. If the Company were to lose any of its licenses to conduct its business, it could result in the temporary or permanent closure of stores and online activities, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe complexity of the political and regulatory environment in which the Company operates and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to changing political landscape and additional legal and regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s ongoing expansion into new markets and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and brand, failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations such as those outlined above may result in the Company being subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse real estate market fluctuations and/or the inability to renew and extend store operating leases could affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company leases most of its locations. A significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in store lease costs as the Company opens new locations and renews leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company also owns certain developed and undeveloped real estate, which could be impacted by adverse market fluctuations. In addition, the inability of the Company to renew, extend or replace expiring store leases could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s lending business is somewhat seasonal, which causes the Company\u2019s revenues and operating cash flows to fluctuate and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to service its debt obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. lending business typically experiences reduced demand in the first and second quarters as a result of its customers\u2019 receipt of federal tax refund checks typically in February of each year. Demand for the Company\u2019s U.S. lending services is generally greatest during the third and fourth quarters. Also, retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the heavy repayment period of pawn loans in Latin America associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter. This seasonality requires the Company to manage its cash flows over the course of the year. If a governmental authority were to pursue economic stimulus actions or issue additional tax refunds, tax credits or other statutory payments at other times during the year, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition during these periods. If the Company\u2019s revenues were to fall substantially below what it would normally expect during certain periods, the Company\u2019s annual financial results and its ability to service its debt obligations could be adversely affected.\nInclement weather or natural disasters can adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe occurrence of weather events such as rain, cold weather, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes, or other natural disasters adversely affecting consumer traffic and loan origination or collection activities at the Company\u2019s stores could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the Company may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance. The Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that the Company obtains vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and management\u2019s decisions with respect to risk retention. The Company\u2019s insurance policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in the Company\u2019s retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase the Company\u2019s expenses, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s growth is subject to external factors and other circumstances over which it has limited control or that are beyond its control. These factors and circumstances could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow through the opening of new store locations.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s expansion strategy is subject to numerous external factors, such as the availability of sites with favorable customer demographics, limited competition, acceptable regulatory restrictions, political or community acceptance, suitable lease terms, its ability to attract, train and retain qualified associates and management personnel, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the ability to identify attractive acquisition targets and complete such acquisitions. Some of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The failure to execute the Company\u2019s expansion strategy would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its business and could materially adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s reported results require the judgment of management, and the Company could be subject to risks associated with these judgments or could be adversely affected by the implementation of new, or changes in the interpretation of existing, accounting principles or financial reporting requirements.\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. In addition, the Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and GAAP and its interpretations are subject to change over time. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require the Company to change its financial reporting, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and the Company could be required to restate historical financial reporting.\nUnexpected changes in both domestic and foreign tax rates could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may be negatively impacted should tax rates or changes to tax laws in the U.S. and in Latin America be increased or otherwise affected by changes in allowable expense deductions, or as a result of the imposition of new withholding requirements on repatriation of foreign earnings.\nCertain tax positions taken by the Company require the judgment of management and could be challenged by federal taxing authorities in the United States and Latin America.\nManagement\u2019s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Management\u2019s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes.\nThe impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company has exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of its corporate cash balances and commodity transactions. If the Company\u2019s counterparties and financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have serious consequences to the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be impacted by the outbreak of certain public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics and other contagious diseases.\nIn the event of an outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other contagious diseases, regulatory and/or public health officials could restrict store operating hours, product offerings and/or the number of customers allowed in a store at one time, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. In addition, to the extent that the Company\u2019s customers become infected by such diseases, or feel uncomfortable visiting public locations due to a perceived risk of exposure to contagious diseases, the Company could experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, its ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business depends to a certain extent upon the value associated with its intellectual property rights. The Company uses the trademarks \u201cFirst Cash,\u201d \u201cFirst Cash Pawn\u201d and \u201cCash America\u201d along with numerous other trade names as described herein. The Company has also developed a proprietary point of sale system for use in its stores. The Company relies on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. While the Company intends to vigorously protect its trademarks and proprietary point of sale systems against infringement, it may not be successful. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights and trademarks could be substantial.\nBecause the Company maintains a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories in its stores, the Company may be subject to employee and third-party robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts. The Company also may be subject to liability as a result of crimes at its stores.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories in most of its stores. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk of riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts. Although the Company has implemented various programs in an effort to reduce these risks, maintains insurance coverage for riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts and utilizes various security measures at its facilities, there can be no assurance that riots, looting, robberies, burglaries\nand thefts will not occur. The extent of the Company\u2019s cash, loan collateral and inventory losses or shortages could increase as it expands the nature and scope of its products and services. Riots, looting, robberies, burglaries and thefts could lead to losses and shortages and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. It is also possible that violent crimes such as riots, assaults and armed robberies may be committed at the Company\u2019s stores. The Company could experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. For example, the Company may be liable if an employee, customer, guard or bystander suffers bodily injury or other harm. Any such event may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Cash America Merger\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger or those benefits may take longer, if at all, to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.\nThe ability of the Company to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, the Company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of First Cash and Cash America. The integration process may disrupt the business of the Company and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the Company and could adversely impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers and diversion of the attention of the Company\u2019s management and employees. The challenges of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the Merger;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures, regulatory and compliance programs and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the acculturation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company with both a domestic and foreign business presence;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\nchallenges in retaining or attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future success of the combined company; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping key business relationships in place.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the control of the Company, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of First Cash and Cash America are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or cash flows that are expected, and the Company will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of First Cash and Cash America. All of these factors could cause dilution of the earnings per share of the Company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger, negatively impact the price of the Company\u2019s stock, impair the ability of the Company to return capital to its stockholders or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution of the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s management currently anticipates that the Merger will be accretive to stockholders on an adjusted earnings per share basis in 2017. This expectation is based on currently available net revenue and operating expense estimates, which may materially change. The Company could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger. All of these factors could cause dilution of the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a decrease in the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations resulting from the Merger.\nAs a result of the Merger, the size of the business of the Company has increased significantly. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the Merger will be successful or that the Company will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits anticipated from the Merger.\nThe Company is expected to incur substantial future expenses related to the Merger and the integration of First Cash\u2019s and Cash America\u2019s businesses.\nThe Company has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the integration of First Cash and Cash America, and will incur additional significant expenses in connection therewith in future periods. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including store point of sale and pawn transaction management systems, accounting and finance, payroll and incentive compensation, pawn collateral valuation and pricing, legal and regulatory compliance and employee benefits. While the integration of such items have begun, a significant amount of integration work remains and is expected to continue through 2017 and 2018. The Company has assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred in connection with the integration, however, there are many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the Company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses will result in the Company taking meaningful charges against earnings in the period following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nIf the Merger does not qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the former Cash America shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nAlthough the Company intends that the Merger qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that the Merger fails to qualify as such. If the IRS were to be successful in any such contention or if for any other reason the Merger were to fail to qualify as a \u201creorganization,\u201d each former Cash America shareholder would recognize a gain or loss with respect to all such shareholder\u2019s shares of Cash America\u2019s common stock based on the difference between (i) the former Cash America shareholders\u2019 tax basis in such shares and (ii) the aggregate cash and the fair market value of the Company common stock received.\nThe CFPB issued a consent order with respect to Cash America, and any noncompliance could have a material adverse effect.\nOn November 20, 2013, Cash America consented to the issuance of a consent order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 review of Cash America\u2019s consumer loan business, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. Cash America also agreed to set aside $8 million for a period of 180 days to fund any further payments to eligible Ohio customers in connection with Cash America\u2019s voluntary program to reimburse Ohio customers that was initiated by Cash America in 2012 in connection with legal collections proceedings initiated by Cash America in Ohio from January 1, 2008 through December 4, 2012 (the \u201cOhio Reimbursement Program\u201d). The consent order also relates to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB during its 2012 examination of Cash America, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the interest rate permitted by the MLA; for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB\u2019s examination of Cash America; for certain conduct in the examination process; and certain conduct giving rise to the Ohio Reimbursement Program. Cash America remains subject to the obligations of the consent order, including the CFPB\u2019s order that Cash America ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws and develop more robust compliance policies and procedures; however, certain restrictions and obligations expired on November 20, 2016. The compliance plan mandated by the consent order requires Cash America to perform ongoing consumer protection compliance risk reviews before introducing or implementing new or changed products or services. This requirement could result in additional delay or cost when introducing, integrating or implementing new or changed products or services, or a decision not to proceed with such initiatives. In addition, Cash America\u2019s former subsidiary, Enova International, Inc. (\u201cEnova\u201d), also remains subject to the consent order because it was part of Cash America when the consent order was issued. Cash America cannot assure that Enova will continue to comply with the consent order now that it is a separate publicly traded company. If Enova does not comply with the consent order, Cash America could be held liable for Enova\u2019s noncompliance. Any noncompliance with the consent order, continuing obligations or similar orders or agreements from other regulators could lead to further regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company could be responsible for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off by Cash America of Enova, in November 2014 (the \u201cEnova Spin-off\u201d).\nThe Enova Spin-off was conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel that the Enova Spin-off will be treated as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Accordingly, the Internal Revenue Service may reach conclusions with respect to the Enova Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations made by Cash America, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel\u2019s conclusions. In addition, Cash America received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the then retention by Cash America of up to 20% of Enova\u2019s stock will not be in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code. The private letter ruling does not address any other tax issues related to the Enova Spin-off. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the retention of the Enova stock was in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings that Cash America or Enova have made or provided to the IRS are not correct. If the retention is in pursuant to a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. federal income tax, then the distribution could ultimately be determined to be taxable, and the Company would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of Enova\u2019s common stock distributed to Cash America\u2019s shareholders on the distribution date over Cash America\u2019s tax basis in such shares of Enova\u2019s common stock. In addition, Cash America agreed to certain actions in connection with the private letter ruling, such as disposing of the Enova common stock by September 15, 2017. All of the shares held by the Company as of the Merger date were sold in open market transactions at an average price of $10.40 per share, with the final sales completed on December 6, 2016.\nWhile the Company believes that the Merger did not and will not adversely impact the tax-free status of the Enova Spin-off, it is possible that the IRS could assert that the Merger should result in the Enova Spin-off being treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to be successful in any contention that the Enova Spin-off should be treated as a taxable transaction or, if for any other reason, the Company were to take actions that would cause the Enova Spin-off to be treated as a taxable transaction, the Company could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, in accordance with a tax matters agreement entered into between Cash America and Enova in connection with the Enova Spin-off, the Company could be subject to liability for any tax liabilities incurred by Enova or Enova\u2019s shareholders if the Merger were to cause the Enova Spin-off to be deemed taxable.\nIn connection with the Enova Spin-off, Enova and Cash America agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities; if the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Enova, it may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and Enova\u2019s indemnity could be insufficient or Enova could be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to a separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements that Cash America entered into with Enova at the time of the Enova Spin-off, including a tax matters agreement, Enova agreed to indemnify Cash America for certain liabilities that could be related to tax, regulatory, litigation or other liabilities, and Cash America agreed to indemnify Enova for certain similar liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. In addition, the tax matters agreement prohibits Enova from taking any action or failing to take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Enova Spin-off to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the private letter ruling obtained in connection with the Enova Spin-off or opinions of counsel received by Cash America or Enova. Indemnities that Cash America may be required to provide Enova are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, particularly indemnities relating to actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold the Company responsible for any of the liabilities that Enova has agreed to assume. Further, the indemnity from Enova could be insufficient to protect the Company against the full amount of such liabilities, or Enova may be unable to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if the Company ultimately succeeds in recovering from Enova any amounts for which it is held liable, the Company may be temporarily required to bear these losses and could suffer reputational risks if the losses are related to regulatory, litigation or other matters.\nA discussion of certain market risks is covered in \u201cItem 7A.
