RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We may also be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following occurs, our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the trading prices of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could substantially decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning our company set forth in, or attached as an exhibit to, this annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A.\u201d\nRisks Related to Sempra Energy\nSempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities that are accounted for as equity method investments, such as Oncor Holdings, and the ability to utilize the cash flows from those subsidiaries and equity method investments.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries and in entities accounted for as equity method investments, such as Oncor Holdings. Our ability to pay dividends and to meet our debt and other obligations depends almost entirely on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments and, in the short term, our ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term, cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments depend on their ability to successfully execute their business strategies and generate positive cash flows. In addition, the subsidiaries and other entities accounted for as equity method investments are separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from paying any such dividends or making any such loans or distributions under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, as a result of legislation, regulation, court order, contractual restrictions or in times of financial distress. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments as well from the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and prospects.\nConditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally may materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.\nLimitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, as well as our ability to meet contractual and other commitments. In difficult credit market environments, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support new or ongoing business activities. This could cause us to reduce non-safety related capital expenditures and could increase our cost of servicing debt, both of which could significantly reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.\nOther factors can affect the availability and cost of credit for our businesses as well as the terms of equity and debt financing, including:\n\u25aa\nadverse changes to laws and regulations in the states and countries in which we operate\n\u25aa\nthe overall health of the energy industry\n\u25aa\nvolatility in natural gas or electricity prices\n\u25aa\ncredit ratings downgrades\n\u25aa\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions\nIn addition, over the past several years, California IOUs have suffered from the potential catastrophic losses resulting from the impact of the multiple wildfires that spread through Northern and Southern California (the California Wildfires). While the California Wildfires occurred in counties outside of SDG&E\u2019s electric service territory, the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters, the possibility of catastrophic wildfires in the future and the failure of the State of California to adequately address the financial and operational risks facing California IOUs could materially and adversely impact Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 ability to access the capital markets at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nWe are subject to additional risk due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of LIBOR and its potential discontinuance.\nCertain of our financial and commercial agreements, including variable rate indebtedness and credit facilities, as well as interest rate derivatives, incorporate LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including discontinuation or replacement. These reforms, if implemented, will cause this benchmark to perform differently than it has performed in the past or to be discontinued entirely or may have other consequences that cannot be predicted, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements, which may require significant additional time, effort and/or money in the form of consent payments or otherwise, and may not be possible on comparable terms or at all.\nIn an announcement on July 12, 2018, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, emphasized the need for market participants to transition away from LIBOR before the end of 2021. It appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or replaced with a different benchmark rate by 2021. A number of alternatives to LIBOR have been proposed or are being developed, but it is not clear which, if any, will be adopted at this time. Any of these alternatives may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on such indebtedness for the interest periods if the applicable LIBOR rate was available in its current form. More generally, any of the foregoing changes, any other changes to LIBOR as a result of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform or other initiatives, or any further uncertainty surrounding the implementation of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on the cost of our variable rate indebtedness and/or borrowings, the effectiveness of our cash flow hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate LIBOR.\nSempra Energy has substantial investments in Mexico and South America that expose us to foreign currency, inflation, legal, tax, economic, geopolitical and management oversight risk.\nWe have significant foreign operations in Mexico and South America. Our foreign operations pose complex management, foreign currency, inflation, legal, tax and economic risks. Certain of these risks differ from and potentially may be greater than those associated with our domestic businesses. All our international businesses are sensitive to geo-political uncertainties and our non-utility international businesses are sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, all of which may be driven by changes in their environments and potentially volatile worldwide economic conditions, and various regional and local economic and political factors, risks and uncertainties, as well as U.S. foreign policy. Foreign currency exchange and inflation rates and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on our revenue, costs or cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our currency exposures are to the Mexican, Peruvian and Chilean currencies. Our Mexican subsidiary, IEnova, has U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities that give rise to Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. They also have significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are denominated in the Mexican peso and must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. Our primary objective when we attempt to reduce foreign currency risk is to preserve the economic value of our foreign investments and to reduce earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. We may attempt to hedge material cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments. We generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to our South American subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are not the U.S.\ndollar. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in \u201cItem 7. MD&A\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nThe current U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements. For example, in November 2018, President Trump signed the USMCA, which, if approved by the legislatures of the U.S., Mexico and Canada, would replace NAFTA. The U.S. and Mexico approved the USMCA in January 2020 and June 2019, respectively, but Canada has yet to provide its approval. The U.S. administration has also implemented changes to U.S. immigration policy and other policies that could impact trade, including increasing tariffs. Such actions could result in changes in the Mexican, U.S. and other markets that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In addition, if the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA, the Mexican government could implement retaliatory actions, such as the imposition of restrictions or import fees on Mexican imports of natural gas from the U.S. or imports and exports of electricity to and from the U.S. Any of these actions by either or both governments could adversely affect imports and exports between Mexico and the U.S. and negatively impact the U.S. and Mexican economies and the companies with whom we conduct business in Mexico, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our plan to divest certain of our assets and businesses as part of our capital rotation plan.\nIn 2019, we completed the divestiture of all our U.S. solar and wind assets and certain non-utility natural gas storage assets in the southeast U.S. Additionally, we entered into agreements to sell our South American businesses, which we expect to close in the first half of 2020, subject to a number of closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the pending sales will be completed. If we do not successfully manage our current capital rotation plan, any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe TCJA may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the value of investments in our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nThe TCJA significantly changed the IRC, including taxation of U.S. corporations by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a one-time deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed earnings of U.S.-owned foreign entities at the time of enactment and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. While the U.S Department of the Treasury has issued final regulations for various sections of the IRC, certain aspects of the legislation are still subject to interpretation and will require implementing regulations by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as state tax authorities, which could lessen or increase adverse impacts. In addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation may be subject to the discretion of the FERC and state public utility commissions.\nAlthough it is unclear when or how capital markets, the FERC or state public utility commissions may respond to the TCJA, we expect that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, will be negatively impacted as a result of an anticipated decrease in required income tax reimbursement payments to us from our domestic utility subsidiaries due to the decrease in the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate. Certain provisions of the TCJA, such as 100% expensing of certain capital expenditures and impacts on utilization of our NOLs, may influence how we fund capital expenditures, the timing of capital expenditures and possible redeployment of capital through sales or monetization of assets, the timing of repatriation of foreign earnings and the use of equity financing to reduce our future use of debt, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will reduce any potential adverse impact from these provisions of the TCJA. In addition, although the deductibility of our interest cost is not limited for the current year, future earnings may be affected based on our method of allocation across our businesses.\nIt is also uncertain whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation. We believe that these strategies, to the extent available and if successfully applied, could lessen any such negative impacts on us, although there can be no assurance in this regard.\nWe discuss the effects of the TCJA further in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur mandatory convertible preferred stock, as well as any additional equity securities we may sell to raise funds, may dilute the economic and voting interests of our common shareholders and may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIn January 2018, we issued 17,250,000 shares of our series A preferred stock, and in July 2018, we issued 5,750,000 shares of our series B preferred stock, which are scheduled to convert into common stock on January 15, 2021 and July 15, 2021, respectively. We may seek to reduce our indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock and, possibly,\nother equity securities, which, together with the conversion of the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock, may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur level of indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts or take other actions, and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments or issue additional equity that may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interest of holders of our common stock.\nOur substantial debt service obligations due to our aggregate indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects by, among other things:\n\u25aa\nmaking it more difficult and/or costly for us to service our debt or pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry sectors in which we operate;\n\u25aa\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, including interest, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes, which could hinder our prospects for growth and the market price of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, among other things;\n\u25aa\nrequiring that additional materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which covenants might limit additional borrowings; and\n\u25aa\nimposing specific restrictions on uses of our assets, as well as prohibiting or limiting our ability to create liens, pay dividends, receive distributions from our subsidiaries, redeem or repurchase our stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets and limit our ability to carry out our capital expenditure program.\nWe are committed to maintaining our credit ratings at investment grade. To maintain these credit ratings, we may reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities. Additional equity issuances may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will be able to issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities with terms that we consider acceptable or at all, or that we will be able to reduce the amount of our outstanding indebtedness, should we elect to do so, to a level that allows us to maintain our investment grade credit ratings, which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nCertain credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook.\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra Energy and the California Utilities, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the increased risk of wildfires in California, perceived supportiveness of the regulatory environment affecting utility operations, including delays and difficulties in obtaining recovery, or the denial of recovery, for wildfire-related costs, ability to generate cash flows, level of indebtedness, overall financial strength, including credit metrics, diversification beyond the regulated utility business (in the case of Sempra Energy), and the status of certain capital projects, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry generally. Downgrades and factors causing downgrades of one or both of the California Utilities can have a material impact on Sempra Energy\u2019s credit ratings. Downgrades, as well as the factors causing such downgrades, of Sempra Energy\u2019s credit ratings could imply diminished credit support available to our subsidiaries. Accordingly, downgrades of Sempra Energy\u2019s credit ratings can also have a material impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries, including the California Utilities.\nWhile the current Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch (collectively, the Rating Agencies) issuer credit ratings for Sempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas are investment grade, there is no assurance that these credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nFor Sempra Energy, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aa\ndelays at the Cameron LNG project and the impact on financial credit metrics;\n\u25aa\nconstruction of LNG liquefaction projects and the impact on business mix and financial credit metrics over time;\n\u25aa\nSempra Energy\u2019s failure to meet certain financial credit metrics;\n\u25aa\nthe CPUC does not effectively implement the more supportive prudency standard associated with the Wildfire Legislation; or\n\u25aa\na ratings downgrade at SDG&E and/or SoCalGas.\nFor SDG&E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aa\nthe CPUC does not effectively implement the more supportive prudency standard associated with the Wildfire Legislation;\n\u25aa\na consistent weakening of SDG&E\u2019s financial metrics;\n\u25aa\ncatastrophic wildfires caused by California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected; or\n\u25aa\na ratings downgrade at Sempra Energy.\nFor SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among other things, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aa\nSoCalGas\u2019 credit metrics do not improve materially after implementation of the GRC and cost of capital decisions finalized in 2019;\n\u25aa\nSoCalGas experiences increased business risk, weakening its standalone business risk profile;\n\u25aa\ndeterioration of, or uncertainty in, the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California; or\n\u25aa\na ratings downgrade at Sempra Energy.\nA downgrade of Sempra Energy\u2019s or either of its California Utilities\u2019 credit ratings may materially and adversely affect the market prices of Sempra Energy\u2019s equity and debt securities, the interest rates at which borrowings are made and debt securities and commercial paper are issued, and the various fees on credit facilities. This could make it significantly more costly for Sempra Energy, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Energy\u2019s other subsidiaries to borrow money, to issue debt securities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings. Such negative credit rating actions, as well as the reasons for such actions could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of, and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on, our debt securities.\nDividend requirements associated with our mandatory convertible preferred stock subject us to certain risks.\nIn January 2018, we issued 17,250,000 shares of our series A preferred stock, and in July 2018, we issued 5,750,000 shares of our series B preferred stock. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends we pay, on our series A preferred stock and our series B preferred stock will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations, and the ability of our subsidiaries and equity method investees to distribute cash to us, as well as other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock.\nThe terms of the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the mandatory convertible preferred stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class, will be entitled to elect a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations described in the certificate of determination applicable to the mandatory convertible preferred stock.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nWhile we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all our shareholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all our shareholders, activist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Responding to proposals by activist shareholders would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses (in the case of a proxy contest) and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy.\nAny perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist shareholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business and operating results.\nActions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock and our preferred stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nRisks Related to All Sempra Energy Businesses\nSevere weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLike other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, mudslides, accidents, equipment failures, explosions or acts of terrorism. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable and explosive materials, as well as radioactive materials, and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents may pose to a typical business. The facilities and infrastructure that we own or in which we have interests that may be subject to such incidents include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\nnatural gas, propane and ethane pipelines, storage and compressor facilities\n\u25aa\nelectric transmission and distribution\n\u25aa\npower generation plants, including renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation\n\u25aa\nmarine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG, and LPG facilities, terminals and storage\n\u25aa\nnuclear power facilities, nuclear fuel and nuclear waste storage facilities (through SDG&E\u2019s 20% minority interest in SONGS, which is currently being decommissioned)\nSuch incidents could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to us. Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide natural gas and electricity to our customers. Other global incidents could have similar effects to the extent they reach and impact the territories in which we operate, the customers we serve or the employees who operate our businesses. For example, the coronavirus outbreak currently affecting China and elsewhere has resulted in travel restrictions and impacts on the global economy that could affect our operations in a manner that is not presently possible to predict. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane or ethane leaks; releases of other GHG; radioactive releases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as in cases where the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies. We discuss how the application of this doctrine in California imposes strict liability on a utility whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire (meaning the utility may be found liable regardless of fault) below under \u201cRisks Related to the California Utilities - The Wildfire Legislation may not adequately protect SDG&E from liability from catastrophic wildfires in its service territory.\u201d Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become prohibitively expensive, may be disputed by the insurers, or may become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to the existence of limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements, and other factors, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects, as well as the trading prices of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nOur businesses are subject to complex government regulations and tax requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or changes thereto.\nThe electric power and natural gas industries are subject to complex government regulations that from time to time undergo significant changes on the federal, state and local levels. The failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant fines and penalties and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities and operations. In addition, changes to these regulations or how these regulations are interpreted may adversely affect how we conduct our business and may subject us to higher compliance costs.\nOur businesses are subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements, and the regulations, laws and tariffs that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs. Any new tax legislation, regulations or other interpretations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our tax expense and/or tax balances, and changes in tax policies could materially adversely impact our business. Changes in regulations, laws and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the California Utilities and other Sempra Energy businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as \u201caffiliate rules,\u201d which primarily impact commodity and commodity-related transactions. These businesses could be materially adversely affected by changes in these rules or to their interpretations, or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to, or to trade with, the California Utilities and with each other. Affiliate rules also restrict these businesses from entering into any such transactions with the California Utilities. Any such restrictions on or approval requirements for transactions among affiliates could materially adversely affect the LNG facilities, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses require numerous permits, licenses, agreements and other approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, and any failure to obtain or maintain them could materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe acquisition, construction, expansion, ownership, maintenance and/or operation of electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, LNG, and LPG facilities, terminals and storage; and other projects require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchise agreements, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including approvals and renewals of rights-of-way over indigenous tribal land. These permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchise agreements, certificates and other approvals may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended by one or more of the governmental agencies and authorities that oversee our businesses or as a result of litigation. For example, SoCalGas\u2019 franchise agreements with the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County expire in December 2020 and June 2023, respectively. SDG&E\u2019s franchise agreement with the City of San Diego is due to expire in January 2021. Successfully maintaining or renewing any or all of these approvals could result in higher costs. Furthermore, our permits may require compliance by our underlying customers. Failure by our customers to comply with permit requirements could result in our permits being modified, suspended or rescinded. In the event one or more of these approvals were to expire or otherwise terminate, we may be required to remove the associated assets from service, construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, or both, and our ability to recover higher costs associated with these events cannot be assured.\nSuccessfully coordinating and completing expansion and construction projects requires good execution from our employees and contractors, cooperation of third parties, and the absence of litigation and regulatory delay. We may invest a significant amount of money in a major capital project prior to receiving regulatory approval. If there is a delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals, if the regulatory approval is conditioned on major changes, if we fail to obtain or maintain required approvals or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be precluded from constructing or operating facilities, or if management decides not to proceed with the project, we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project, which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. Further, accidents beyond our control may cause us to violate the terms of conditional use permits, causing delays in projects. Any such delay or failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals could cause our operations and prospects to materially decline, and/or our costs to materially increase, and otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and/or results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air quality, water quality and usage, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, hazardous waste disposal and remediation, conservation of natural resources, wetlands and wildlife, renewable energy resources, climate change and GHG emissions. We are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses. Additionally, to comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees. Our regulated utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs for projects are not recoverable in rates. In addition, we may be ultimately responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our projects and properties; in each case regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown, which exposes us to risks arising from\ncontamination at our former or existing facilities or with respect to offsite waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations. In the case of our California and other regulated utilities, some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Our facilities, including those in our JVs, are subject to laws and regulations that have been the subject of increased enforcement activity with respect to power generation facilities. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits may subject our businesses to substantial penalties and fines and/or significant curtailments of our operations, which could materially adversely affect our cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreasing international, national, regional and state-level environmental concerns as well as related new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial negative effects on our operations, operating costs and the scope and economics of proposed expansions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects. In particular, state-level laws and regulations, as well as potential state, national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions, may materially limit or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations. For example, SB 100 requires each California utility, including SDG&E, to procure 50% of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026, and 60% by 2030. SB 100 also creates the policy of meeting all the State of California\u2019s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by 2045, for a total of 100% clean energy. The law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling, and requires that the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies incorporate this into all relevant planning. Our California Utilities may be materially adversely affected if these additional costs are not recoverable in rates. Even if recoverable, the effects of existing and proposed GHG emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth and may have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities\u2019 cash flows. SDG&E may also be subject to significant penalties and fines if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met.\nIn addition, existing and future laws, orders and regulations regarding mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, methane or other emissions could result in requirements for additional monitoring, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices or emission fees, taxes or penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us.\nSempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and arbitration proceedings, including in connection with the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility natural gas leak. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial amounts of money and time defending these lawsuits and proceedings, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. We discuss pending proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits, arbitrations and other legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from our customers, which in each case could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWe cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. In addition, for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as planned.\nTo reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. Certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting. Such accounting may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts. In certain cases, these gains or losses may not reflect the associated losses or gains of the underlying position being hedged.\nRisk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses.\nAlthough we have in place risk management and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended by our businesses or may not work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of\nthese and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent or mitigate losses that would materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.\nSeveral of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIn addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g. malware, malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information, smart grid infrastructure, and natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure.\nExisting business technologies and the deployment of new business technologies represent a large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Additionally, we often rely on third party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain, modify and update our systems, including systems that manage sensitive information. These third parties could fail to establish adequate risk management and information security measures to protect our systems and information. While our computer systems have been, and will continue to be, subjected to computer viruses or other malware, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks, to date we have not detected a material breach of cybersecurity. Addressing these risks is the subject of significant ongoing activities across Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, including investing in risk management and information security measures to protect our systems. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated cyber risks. Despite our best efforts, our businesses may not be fully insulated from cyber-attacks and system disruptions. An attack on our information systems, the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines and distribution and storage infrastructure or one of our facilities, or unauthorized access to confidential customer information, could result in energy delivery service failures, financial and reputational loss, violations of privacy laws, customer dissatisfaction and litigation, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. Sempra Energy maintains cyber liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised and there is no guarantee that the insurance that we do maintain will continue to be available at rates that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nFurther, as seen with recent cyber-attacks around the world, the goal of a cyber-attack may be primarily to inflict large-scale harm on a company and the places where it operates. Any such cyber-attack could cause widespread disruptions to our operating, financial and administrative systems, including the destruction of critical information and programming that could materially adversely affect our business operations and the integrity of the power grid, negatively impact our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements or comply with ongoing disclosure obligations or other regulatory requirements, and/or release confidential information about our company and our customers, employees and other constituents, any of which could lead to sanctions or negatively affect the general perception of our business in the financial markets and which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to the California Utilities\nThe California Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect us.\nThe CPUC regulates the California Utilities\u2019 rates, except SDG&E\u2019s electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates, among other matters, the California Utilities\u2019:\n\u25aa\nconditions of service\n\u25aa\nsales of securities\n\u25aa\nrates of return\n\u25aa\ncapital structure\n\u25aa\nrates of depreciation\n\u25aa\nlong-term resource procurement\nThe CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility operations, safety standards and practices, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances, fines and penalties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. SoCalGas and SDG&E may be subject to penalties or fines related to their operation of natural gas pipelines and storage and, for SDG&E, electric operations, under regulations concerning natural gas pipeline safety and citation programs concerning both gas and electric safety, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the California Utilities\u2019 rates, costs, incentive mechanisms and performance-based regulation in Notes 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe CPUC periodically approves the California Utilities\u2019 rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments, as well as settlements, while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework. Delays by the CPUC on decisions authorizing recovery or denying recovery, after-the-fact reasonableness reviews with unclear standards, authorizations for less than full recovery or rejection of their settlements may adversely affect the working capital, cash flows and financial condition of each of the California Utilities. If the California Utilities receive an adverse CPUC decision and/or actual capital expenditures and/or operating costs were to exceed the amounts approved by the CPUC, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nSoCalGas and SDG&E have significantly invested and continue to invest in major programs, such as PSEP, under an approved CPUC framework. However, the total investment to date is substantially subject to CPUC reasonableness review. Although we believe these costs have been prudently incurred, the standards applied by the CPUC could result in the disallowance of a portion of these incurred costs, which could materially and adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn California, there are laws that establish rules governing, among other subjects, communications between CPUC officials, CPUC staff and regulated utilities. Rules and processes around ex parte communications could result in delayed decisions, increased investigations, enforcement actions and penalties. In addition, the CPUC or other parties may initiate investigations of past communications between public utilities and CPUC officials and staff that could result in reopening completed proceedings for reconsideration.\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.\nThe California Utilities may be materially adversely affected by new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. In addition, existing legislation or regulations may be revised or reinterpreted. New, revised or reinterpreted legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how the California Utilities operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur substantial additional expenses.\nOur California Utilities are also affected by the activities of organizations such as TURN, Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network, Sierra Club and other stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups. To the extent that these groups are successful in influencing our California Utilities\u2019 operations, this could have a material adverse effect on the California Utilities\u2019 businesses, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nThe Wildfire Legislation may not adequately protect SDG&E from liability from catastrophic wildfires in its service territory and we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or at all.\nIn July 2019, the Governor of California signed the Wildfire Legislation into law, which addresses certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the State of California and their impact on electric IOUs. Investor-owned gas distribution utilities such as SoCalGas are not covered by this legislation. The issues addressed include wildfire mitigation, cost recovery standards and requirements, a wildfire fund, a cap on liability, and the establishment of a wildfire safety board. The Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability on a utility (meaning that the utility may be found liable regardless of fault) whose equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. Rather, the Wildfire Legislation established a revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs (Revised Prudent Manager Standard) and established the Wildfire Fund designed to provide liquidity to participating California electric IOUs to pay IOU wildfire-related claims in the event that the\ngovernmental agency responsible for determining causation determines the applicable IOU\u2019s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire, primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied. We are unable to predict whether the Wildfire Legislation will be effectively implemented and its impact on SDG&E\u2019s ability to recover certain costs and expenses in cases where SDG&E\u2019s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation.\nWe have experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the California Utilities\u2019 operations, particularly SDG&E\u2019s operations. In addition, the insurance that has been obtained for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses that we may incur, or may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation of $1 billion. Uninsured losses may not be recoverable in customer rates. Increases in the cost of insurance may be challenged when we seek cost recovery. California courts have invoked the doctrine of inverse condemnation for wildfire damages, whereby if a utility company\u2019s equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be a cause of one or more fires, the utility could be held strictly liable for damages, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees, without having been found negligent. As a result of the strict liability standard applied to wildfires, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be available or may be available only at rates that are prohibitively expensive. In addition, even if insurance for wildfire liabilities is available, it may not be available in such amounts as are necessary to cover potential losses. A loss which is neither fully insured nor can be recovered in customer rates, such as the CPUC decision denying SDG&E\u2019s recovery of costs for the 2007 wildfires, could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be allowed to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the costs of any uninsured losses.\nWe monitor weather conditions continuously to help ensure the safe operation of our facilities during the periods of elevated wildfire ignition risk. Should conditions become extreme, we may de-energize certain of our facilities as a last resort to minimize this safety risk to the public. Such \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d could be subject to increased scrutiny by regulators and law makers, and may lead to increased risk of penalties and liability for damages. There can be no assurance that such costs would be recoverable in rates.\nExtreme weather conditions, changing weather patterns and population growth in areas of the State of California in environments with historically higher risk of wildfires could materially affect the California Utilities\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nFrequent and more severe drought conditions, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds have increased the degree and prevalence of wildfires in California including in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories, which could place third party property and our electric and natural gas infrastructure in jeopardy and reduce the availability of hydroelectric generators. This could result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories and/or catastrophic destruction of third-party property for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable and unable to recover from ratepayers or may have inadequate insurance coverage. The Wildfire Legislation, signed into law in July 2019, includes a number of measures primarily intended to address certain important issues related to catastrophic wildfires in the State of California, including wildfire mitigation, cost recovery standards and requirements, a wildfire fund, a cap on liability, and the establishment of a wildfire safety board. However, in the event of a significant wildfire involving SDG&E equipment, the standards prescribed by the Wildfire Legislation may not be applied by the State of California consistently or the Wildfire Fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in other California IOUs\u2019 service territories, by fires in SDG&E\u2019s service territory or by a combination thereof, which could impact our ability to timely access capital necessary to address, in whole or in part, inverse condemnation and other liabilities. In addition, the State of California has been subject to housing shortages such that certain local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed in certain cases to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high risk fire areas that may not have the infrastructure or contingency plans necessary to address such risk.\nSevere rainstorms and associated high winds in our service territories, as well as flooding and mudslides where vegetation has been destroyed as result of human modification or wildfires, could damage our electric and natural gas infrastructure, resulting in increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repair costs and interruptions in natural gas and electricity delivery services. As a result, these events can have significant financial consequences, including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the California Utilities encounter difficulties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis. Further, the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEvents or conditions caused by climate change, including risk of wildfires, severe weather conditions and flooding caused by rising sea levels, could have a greater impact on the California Utilities\u2019 operations than the California Utilities currently\nanticipate. If the CPUC fails to adjust the California Utilities\u2019 rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change or if a major fire is determined to be caused by our equipment, Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected.\nThe California Utilities are subject to risks arising from the operation, maintenance and upgrades of their natural gas and electricity infrastructure and information technology systems, which, if they materialize, could adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and the California Utilities\u2019 financial results.\nThe California Utilities own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission, distribution and storage facilities, which are, in many cases, interconnected and/or managed by information technology systems. The California Utilities undertake substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, improve and upgrade these facilities and systems, but while these capital investment projects are in process and even once completed, there is a risk of, among other things, potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and information technology systems, human error in operations or maintenance, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. In addition, as discussed above, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.\nAdditional risks associated with the ability of the California Utilities to safely and reliably operate, maintain, improve and upgrade their facilities and systems, many of which are beyond the California Utilities\u2019 control, include:\n\u25aa\nchallenges associated with meeting customer demand for natural gas and/or electricity that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life;\n\u25aa\na prolonged widespread electrical black-out that results in damage to the California Utilities\u2019 equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties;\n\u25aa\ninadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that could lead to public or employee harm or extended outages; severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events or other natural disasters;\n\u25aa\nthe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water or soil, including gas leaks from natural gas pipelines or storage facilities; and\n\u25aa\nattacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism or war.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for natural gas or electricity; cause unplanned outages; damage the California Utilities\u2019 assets and/or operations; damage the assets and/or operations of third parties on which the California Utilities rely; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the California Utilities could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any such events could materially adversely affect Sempra Energy\u2019s and one or both of the California Utilities\u2019 financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the natural gas leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and mitigating local community environmental impacts from the Leak, some or a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance, and SoCalGas also may incur significant liabilities for damages, restitution, fines, penalties and other costs, and emissions mitigation activities as a result of this incident, some or a significant portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance or may exceed insurance coverage.\nIn October 2015, SoCalGas discovered a leak at one of its injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. As described in \u201cCivil and Criminal Litigation\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Proceedings\u201d in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, numerous lawsuits, investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the Leak, resulting in significant costs.\nCivil and Criminal Litigation\nAs of February 21, 2020, 393 lawsuits, including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs, are pending against SoCalGas related to the Leak, some of which have also named Sempra Energy. All these cases, other than a matter brought by the Los Angeles County District Attorney and the federal securities class action, are coordinated before a single court in the LA Superior Court for pretrial management. The court has scheduled an initial trial for June 24, 2020 for a small number of randomly selected individual plaintiffs. For a more detailed description of the civil and criminal lawsuits brought against us, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFive shareholder derivative actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties have been filed against certain officers and directors of Sempra Energy and/or SoCalGas, four of which were joined in a Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint in August 2017. These complaints were dismissed, and shareholders filed an amended complaint in February 2020. A federal securities class action alleging violation of the federal securities laws also was filed against Sempra Energy and certain of its officers which is on appeal following dismissal by the court.\nA misdemeanor criminal complaint was filed by the LA County District Attorney\u2019s office, as to which SoCalGas entered a settlement that was approved by the LA Superior Court but is subject to appeal by certain residents. Additional litigation, including by public entities, and criminal complaints may be filed against us in the future related to the Leak or our responses thereto.\nThe costs of defending against or resolving the civil and criminal lawsuits, and any compensatory, statutory or punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, if awarded or imposed, as well as the costs of mitigating the actual natural gas released, could be significant. If any of these costs are not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation\nIn January 2016, CalGEM and the CPUC selected Blade to conduct, under their supervision, an independent analysis of the technical root cause of the Leak, to be funded by SoCalGas. The root cause analysis was released in May 2019 and concluded that SoCalGas had complied with gas storage regulations in existence at the time of the Leak and that the related compliance activities conducted prior to the Leak did not find indications of a casing integrity issue, but that there were also measures, though not required by the gas storage regulations at the time, that could have been taken to aid in the early identification of corrosion and that, in the opinion of Blade, would have prevented or mitigated the Leak. In addition, CalGEM is investigating the Leak.\nIn June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to consider penalties against SoCalGas for the Leak. The first phase will consider whether SoCalGas violated Public Utilities Code Section 451 or other laws, CPUC orders or decisions, rules or requirements, whether SoCalGas engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility or its related record-keeping practices, whether SoCalGas cooperated sufficiently with the Safety Enforcement Division (SED) and Blade during the pre-formal investigation, and whether any of the mitigation proposed by Blade should be implemented to the extent not already done. In November 2019, SED, based largely on the Blade report, alleged a total of 330 violations, asserting that SoCalGas violated California Public Utilities Code Section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records. Hearings in the first phase of the OII are scheduled to begin in April 2020. The second phase will consider whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for the Leak and what penalties, if any, should be imposed for any violations proven in the first phase, as well as determine the amounts of various costs incurred by SoCalGas and other parties in connection with the Leak and the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of such costs.\nHigher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas as a result of new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident or our responses thereto could be significant and may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates. In addition, any of these investigations could result in findings of violations of laws, orders, rules or regulations as well as fines, sanctions and other penalties. SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any such new laws, orders, rules and regulations or by these investigations.\nNatural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability\nNatural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and heating needs in the winter. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, with a storage capacity of 86 Bcf (representing 63% of SoCalGas\u2019 natural gas storage capacity), is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important element of SoCalGas\u2019 delivery system. As a result of the Leak, SoCalGas suspended injection of natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in October 2015 and, following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by CalGEM and the CPUC\u2019s Executive Director, resumed limited injection operations in July 2017. In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to SB 380 to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region.\nIf the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed, or if future cash flows were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs and/or additional capital expenditures, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. At December 31,\n2019, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of $769 million. Any significant impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations for the period in which it is recorded. Higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by SoCalGas may not be recoverable in customer rates, and SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nInsurance and Estimated Costs\nExcluding directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, we have at least four kinds of insurance policies that together we estimate provide between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in insurance coverage, depending on the nature of the claims. At December 31, 2019, SoCalGas\u2019 estimate of costs related to the Leak of $1,116 million includes $1,086 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance. This estimate may rise significantly as more information becomes available. Costs not included in the $1,116 million cost estimate could be material. We have received insurance payments for many of our costs, including temporary relocation and associated processing costs, control-of-well expenses, costs of the government-ordered response to the Leak, legal costs and lost gas.\nIf any costs are not covered by insurance (including any costs in excess of applicable policy limits), if there are significant delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in \u201cCivil and Criminal Litigation\u201d above, the actions against us seek compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, which except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions, are not included in the $1,116 million cost estimate as it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the amount of damages, restitution or civil, administrative or criminal fines, sanctions, penalties or other costs. This cost estimate also does not include future legal costs to defend litigation, and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate. Furthermore, the cost estimate does not include certain other costs incurred by Sempra Energy through December 31, 2019 associated with defending shareholder derivative lawsuits. Costs not included in the $1,116 million cost estimate could be material. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining insurance coverage for these costs under the applicable policies, and to the extent we are not successful in obtaining coverage or these costs exceed the amount of our coverage, such costs could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional Information\nWe discuss Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility matters further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNatural gas pipeline safety assessments may not be fully or adequately recovered in rates.\nThe California Utilities test or replace natural gas transmission pipelines located in populated areas that either have not been pressure tested or lack sufficient documentation of a pressure test, to enhance existing valve infrastructure and to retrofit pipelines to allow for the use of in-line inspection technology, referred to as SoCalGas\u2019 and SDG&E\u2019s PSEP.\nThe CPUC established criteria to determine the amounts related to PSEP that may be recovered from ratepayers and the processes for recovery of such amounts, including providing that such costs are subject to a reasonableness review. In the future, certain PSEP costs may be subject to recovery as determined by separate regulatory filings with the CPUC, including GRC filings. PSEP-related proceedings before the CPUC regarding the California Utilities\u2019 reasonableness review and cost recovery requests are often challenged by intervening parties. In the future, consumer advocacy groups may similarly challenge the California Utilities\u2019 petitions for recovery and recommend disallowances in whole or in part with respect to applications to recover PSEP costs, including through GRC filings.\nFrom 2011 through 2019, SoCalGas and SDG&E have invested and have or plan to seek recovery for approximately $1.8 billion and $445 million, respectively, in PSEP, with substantial additional expenditures planned. As of December 31, 2019, SoCalGas and SDG&E have received approval for recovery of $1.3 billion and $15 million, respectively. On January 30, 2020 SoCalGas and SDG&E reached a settlement with certain intervenors in the 2018 reasonableness review proceeding, which would resolve all but one issue regarding the period of recovery. The settlement is subject to CPUC approval. Beginning in 2019, the majority of investments in PSEP projects are being recovered in base rates as approved in the 2019 GRC FD. If the CPUC denies or significantly delays rate recovery for PSEP and other gas pipeline safety costs incurred by SoCalGas and SDG&E, it could materially adversely affect the respective company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe California Utilities are subject to increasingly stringent safety standards and the potential for significant penalties if regulators deem either SDG&E or SoCalGas to be out of compliance.\nSB 291 requires the CPUC to develop and maintain a safety enforcement program that includes procedures for monitoring, data tracking and analysis, and investigations, and delegates citation authority to CPUC staff personnel under the direction of the CPUC Executive Director. Under the enforcement program, the maximum penalty is $50,000 per offense. Each day of an ongoing violation may be counted as an additional offense. CPUC staff has authority to issue citations up to an administrative limit of $8 million per citation under either program and such citations may be appealed to the CPUC. Although citations issued under these enforcement programs do include an administrative limit, penalties issued by the CPUC can exceed this limit, having exceeded $1.5 billion in one instance for an unrelated third party.\nIf the CPUC or its staff determine that either of SDG&E\u2019s or SoCalGas\u2019 operations and practices are not in compliance with applicable safety standards and operating procedures, the corrective or mitigation actions required to become in conformance, if not sufficiently funded in customer rates, and any penalties imposed, could materially adversely affect that company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe failure by the CPUC to continue reforms of SDG&E\u2019s rate structure, including the implementation of charges independent of consumption volume and reforms to reduce NEM rate subsidies, could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers.\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation (primarily solar installations). Under NEM, qualifying customer-generators receive a full retail rate for the energy they generate that is fed to the utility\u2019s power grid. This occurs during times when the customer\u2019s generation exceeds their own energy usage (wholesale rates apply only if a customer\u2019s annual generation exceeds their annual consumption). Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain limitations, while they still receive electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. The unpaid NEM costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as higher electric-use residential customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing customers.\nIn July 2015, the CPUC adopted a decision that provided a framework for rates that we believe are more transparent, fair and sustainable. The framework provides for a minimum monthly bill, fewer rate tiers and a gradual reduction in the differences between the tiered rates, and directs the utilities to pursue expanded time-of-use rates. The framework will be fully implemented in 2020 and should result in relief for higher-use customers and a rate structure that better aligns rates with actual costs to serve customers. The decision also establishes a process for utilities to seek implementation of a fixed charge for residential customers in 2020, subject to certain conditions. We believe the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers may become more critical to help ensure rates are fair for all customers, including the NEM issue discussed above. Distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives could generally reduce delivered volumes, increasing the importance of a fixed charge. In addition, the continuing increase of solar installations and other forms of self-generation adversely impacts the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system and could increase fixed costs.\nIf the CPUC fails to continue to reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure to maintain reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could lead to the disallowance of recovery for our costs, including power procurement costs, operating or capital costs, or the imposition of fines and penalties. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources, such as solar, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. This growth will eventually require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid\u2019s capacity to interconnect distributed energy resources. The CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate various demonstration projects and pilots; implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources; and if feasible, what, if any, compensation would be appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings may result in new regulations, policies and/or\noperational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nSDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load, customers do have the ability to receive procurement service from a load serving entity other than SDG&E, through programs such as DA and CCA. DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Utility customers could also receive procurement through CCA, if the customer\u2019s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program. Several local political jurisdictions, including the City and County of San Diego and other municipalities, are considering implementing or are implementing a CCA, which could result in SDG&E providing procurement service for less than half of its current customer load as early as 2021. When customers are served by another load serving entity, SDG&E no longer procures electricity for this departing load and the associated costs of the utility\u2019s procured resources could then be borne by SDG&E\u2019s remaining bundled procurement customers. State law requires that customers opting to have a CCA procure their electricity must absorb the cost of above-market electricity procurement commitments already made by SDG&E on their behalf. If adequate mechanisms are not implemented to ensure compliance with state law, remaining bundled customers of SDG&E could potentially experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA customers prior to their departure, which may not be fully recoverable in rates by SDG&E. If legislative, regulatory or legal action were taken to prevent the timely recovery of these procurement costs or if mechanisms are not in place to ensure compliance with state law, the unrecovered costs could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural gas and natural gas storage has increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source.\nCalifornia legislators and stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable energy and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. The CPUC initiated an OIR to update gas reliability standards, determine the regulatory changes necessary to improve coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gas-fired electric generators, and implement a long-term planning strategy to manage the state\u2019s transition away from natural gas-fueled technologies to meet California\u2019s decarbonization goals. The OIR will be conducted in three phases. The first phase will address reliability standards. The second phase will address coordination between natural gas utilities and natural gas-fired electric generators. The third phase will implement a long-term planning strategy. Comments on the scope of the new OIR were due on February 26, 2020. A substantial reduction or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in California could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nSDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its partial ownership of a nuclear facility that is being decommissioned.\nSDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, formerly a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, that is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, the majority owner of SONGS. SDG&E, and each of the other owners, is responsible for financing its share of expenses and capital expenditures, including decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E\u2019s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to the risks of owning a partial interest in a nuclear generation facility, which include:\n\u25aa\nthe potential release of a radioactive material including from a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami that could cause catastrophic harm to human health and the environment;\n\u25aa\nthe potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the prior operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;\n\u25aa\nlimitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operations and the decommissioning of the facility; and\n\u25aa\nuncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility.\nIn addition, SDG&E maintains NDTs for providing funds to decommission SONGS. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to significant market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets or an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which in each case may not be fully recoverable in rates. Furthermore, CPUC approval is required in order to make withdrawals from these trusts. CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied by the CPUC altogether if the CPUC determines that the expenditures are unreasonable. Finally, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the trust funds. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur.\nInterpretations of tax regulations could impact access to NDT funds for reimbursement of spent nuclear fuel management costs. In December 2016, the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations that clarify the definition of \u201cnuclear decommissioning costs.\u201d These proposed regulations will be effective prospectively once they are finalized. SDG&E is awaiting the adoption of, or additional refinement to, the proposed regulations before determining whether the proposed regulations will allow SDG&E to timely access the NDT funds for reimbursement or payment of the spent fuel management costs incurred in 2017 and subsequent years. Until the litigation against the DOE by Edison and SDG&E seeking recovery of spent fuel management costs is resolved or IRS regulations regarding spent fuel management costs are confirmed to apply, SDG&E expects to continue to pay for its share of such spent fuel management costs without reimbursement from the NDT. If SDG&E is unable to obtain timely access to the trusts for these costs, SDG&E\u2019s cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a substantial reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra Energy\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Interest in Oncor\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management and policies of Oncor.\nVarious \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures are in place to enhance Oncor\u2019s separateness from its owners and to mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting its owners. This ring-fence creates both legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra Energy and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand.\nIn accordance with the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments we made in connection with the Merger, we and Oncor are subject to various restrictions, including, among others:\n\u25aa\nseven members of Oncor\u2019s 13-person board of directors will be independent directors in relation to Sempra Energy and any other direct or indirect owners of Oncor. With respect to the non-independent directors, two will be designated by Sempra Energy, two will be appointed by Oncor\u2019s minority owner, TTI, and two will be current or former Oncor officers;\n\u25aa\nOncor may not pay any dividends if a majority of its independent directors or a minority member director determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts;\n\u25aa\nOncor will not pay dividends if that payment would cause its debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT;\n\u25aa\nif Oncor\u2019s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody\u2019s), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT;\n\u25aa\nthere must be maintained certain \u201cseparateness measures\u201d that reinforce the financial separation of Oncor from Sempra Energy, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra Energy must be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or stock for any entity other than Oncor;\n\u25aa\na majority of Oncor\u2019s independent directors must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in such budget is more than a 10% increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts of such expenditures in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable; and\n\u25aa\nSempra Energy will continue to hold indirectly at least 51% of the ownership interests in Oncor Holdings and Oncor for at least five years following the closing of the Merger, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the PUCT.\nAs a result, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. We have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor board of directors, which are controlled by independent directors. The Oncor directors have considerable autonomy and, as described in our commitments, have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may be contrary to our best interests or be in opposition to our preferred strategic direction for Oncor. To the extent that they take actions that are not in our interests, the financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects of Sempra Energy may be materially adversely affected.\nIf Oncor fails to respond to challenges in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and this could materially adversely affect us.\nBecause Oncor is regulated by both U.S. federal and Texas state authorities, it has been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. The costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory requirements and adjusting Oncor\u2019s business to legislative and regulatory developments may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. Moreover,\npotential legislative changes, regulatory changes or other market or industry changes may create greater risks to the predictability of utility earnings generally. If Oncor does not successfully respond to these changes, it could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects.\nOncor\u2019s operations are capital intensive and it could have liquidity needs that may require us to make additional investments in Oncor.\nOncor\u2019s business is capital intensive, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs with the proceeds from indebtedness. In the event that Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements, we may elect to make additional investments in Oncor. Similarly, if Oncor is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional investments in Oncor which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In that regard, our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor. As a result, if Oncor requires additional financing and cannot obtain it from other sources, we may elect to make a capital contribution, rather than a loan, to Oncor.\nSempra Energy could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH\u2019s 2016 spin-off of Vistra from EFH is deemed to be taxable.\nAs part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spinoff), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra\u2019s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its stockholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the IRC (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment of the spin-off, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\nIn connection with the signing and closing of the Merger, EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra Energy and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsel that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra Energy and EFH, now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and as a result, could be successfully challenged by the IRS. If it is determined that the Merger causes the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra Energy, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects of Sempra Energy and on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Should the IRS invalidate the private letter ruling and/or the supplemental private letter ruling, Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. has administrative appeal rights including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court.\nRisks Related to our Businesses Other Than the California Utilities and Our Interest in Oncor\nBusiness development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled, be completed within budget or operate at expected levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe acquisition, development, construction and expansion of LNG liquefaction, marine and inland ethane and liquid fuels, and LPG terminals and storage; natural gas, propane and ethane pipelines and distribution and storage facilities; electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built.\nSuccess in developing a project is contingent upon, among other things:\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of satisfactory LNG offtake and equity agreements\n\u25aa\nnegotiation of supply, natural gas and LNG sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements and PPAs\n\u25aa\ntimely receipt of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations and maintenance of these authorizations\n\u25aa\nour counterparties\u2019 financial or other ability to fulfill their contractual commitments\n\u25aa\ntimely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction\n\u25aa\nobtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project\nSuccessful completion of a project may be materially adversely affected by, among other factors:\n\u25aa\nunforeseen engineering problems\n\u25aa\nconstruction delays due to adverse weather conditions, work stoppages, equipment unavailability and other events and contractor performance shortfalls\n\u25aa\nour counterparties\u2019 financial or other inability to fulfill their contractual commitments\n\u25aa\nfailure to obtain or maintain required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations\n\u25aa\nlitigation\n\u25aa\nunsettled property rights\nIf we are unable to complete a development project or if we have substantial delays or cost overruns, this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe operation of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of liquefaction, regasification and storage facilities, electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, environmental contamination and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt liquefaction, generation, regasification, storage, transmission and distribution systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to our facilities being idled for an extended period of time or our facilities operating well below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nThe design, development and construction of the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility involves numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe have a 50.2% interest in Cameron LNG JV, which is building an LNG export facility consisting of three liquefaction trains designed to a total nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an expected export capability of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf per day.\nCameron LNG JV has a lump-sum, turnkey EPC contract with a JV between CB&I, LLC (as assignee of CB&I Shaw Constructors, Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of McDermott International, Inc., and Chiyoda International Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chiyoda Corporation. If the EPC contractor becomes unwilling or unable to perform according to the terms and timetable of the EPC contract, the project could face substantial construction delays and potentially significantly increased costs. In January 2020, McDermott International, Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. McDermott International, Inc. has stated that it expects all of its projects, including the three-train liquefaction project at Cameron LNG JV, to continue on an uninterrupted basis. However, we cannot be certain the Cameron LNG JV project will not be interrupted. If the contractor defaults under the EPC contract due to the bankruptcy of McDermott International, Inc. or for any other reason, such default could result in Cameron LNG JV\u2019s engagement of a substitute contractor. The inability to complete the project in a timely manner or within our current expectations, cost overruns, and the other risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, credit ratings and/or prospects.\nIf the estimated construction, financing and other project costs for the facility substantially exceed our contingency associated with the project budget adopted at the time of our final investment decision, we may have to make material additional, unexpected cash contributions. The majority of the investment in the liquefaction project is project-financed and the balance is provided by the project partners. Any failure by the project partners to make their required investments on a timely basis could result in project delays and could materially adversely affect the development of the project. In addition, Sempra Energy has guaranteed a maximum of up to $4.0 billion related to the project financing and financing-related agreements. These guarantees terminate upon Cameron LNG JV achieving \u201cfinancial completion\u201d of the initial three-train liquefaction project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests. Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Loan Facility Agreements and related finance documents contain events of default customary for such financings, including a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by a financial completion deadline date of September 30, 2021 (with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure). A delay in construction that results in a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by this financial completion deadline date would therefore result in an event of default under\nCameron LNG JV\u2019s financing and a potential demand on Sempra Energy\u2019s guarantees. We anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated approximately nine months after all three trains achieve commercial operation. If, due to Cameron LNG JV\u2019s failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria, we are required to repay some or all of the $4.0 billion under our guarantees, any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nWe face many challenges to develop and complete our contemplated LNG export facilities.\nIn addition to the three-train Cameron LNG liquefaction facility described above, we are evaluating several other LNG export development opportunities. Sempra LNG is in discussions with the co-owners of Cameron LNG JV regarding the potential expansion of up to two additional liquefaction trains at the Cameron LNG liquefaction facility, is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project near Port Arthur, Texas, and, through a JV agreement with IEnova, is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project at IEnova\u2019s existing ECA LNG Regasification facility in Baja California, Mexico to be developed in two phases (a mid-scale project referred to as ECA LNG JV Phase 1 and a large-scale project referred to as ECA LNG JV Phase 2). Each of these contemplated projects face numerous risks and must overcome significant hurdles before we can reach a final investment decision and proceed with construction. Further, a shift in the supply of natural gas could depress LNG prices and the cost advantages of exporting LNG from the U.S. In addition, global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce the demand for natural gas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for LNG. This could result in increased competition among those developing projects in an environment of declining LNG demand, such as the Sempra Energy-sponsored export initiatives. Such reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, which could also lead to increased competition among the LNG suppliers for the declining LNG demand. At certain moderate levels, oil prices could also make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects from North America, thus increasing supply and the competition for the available LNG demand. A decline in natural gas prices outside the U.S. (which in many foreign countries are based on the price of crude oil) may also materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub pricing).\nIn connection with these LNG export development opportunities, which we discuss further in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Sempra LNG,\u201d we have entered into or may enter into Heads of Agreements, MOUs and/or similar agreements, all of which are or will be nonbinding and do not or will not obligate any of the parties to execute any agreements or participate in any such opportunities.\nAny decisions by Sempra Energy or our potential counterparties to proceed with binding agreements with respect to the potential development (or expansion) of our liquefaction projects will require, among other things, obtaining customer commitments to purchase LNG, completion of project assessments and achieving other necessary internal and external approvals of each party. In addition, all our proposed projects are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the receipt of a number of permits and approvals; finding suitable additional partners and customers; obtaining financing and incentives; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including equity acquisition and governance agreements, natural gas supply and transportation agreements, LNG sale and purchase agreements and construction contracts; and reaching a final investment decision.\nFurthermore, there are a number of potential new projects under construction or in the process of development by various project developers in North America, in addition to ours, and given the projected global demand for LNG, the vast majority of these projects likely will not be completed. With respect to our Port Arthur, Texas project, this is a greenfield site, and therefore it may not have the advantages often associated with brownfield sites. The ECA LNG Regasification facility and ECA LNG JV proposed liquefaction project in Mexico are subject to on-going land and permit disputes that could make project financing, as well as finding suitable partners and customers, difficult. In addition, while we have completed the regulatory process for an LNG export facility in the U.S., the regulatory process in Mexico and the overlay of U.S. regulations for natural gas exports to an LNG export facility in Mexico are not well developed. There can be no assurance that a facility could be constructed without facing significant legal challenges and uncertainties, which in turn could make project financing, as well as finding suitable partners and customers for ECA LNG JV Phase 2, difficult. Finally, the ECA LNG Regasification facility currently has profitable long-term regasification contracts for 100% of the regasification facility\u2019s capacity through 2028, making the decision to pursue ECA LNG JV Phase 2 dependent in part on whether the investment in a large-scale liquefaction project would, over the long term, be more beneficial than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts.\nThere can be no assurance that our contemplated LNG export facilities will be completed, and our inability to complete one or more of our contemplated LNG export facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, results of operations and prospects.\nDomestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties that could increase the costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect production of LNG and reduce or eliminate LNG export opportunities and demand.\nHydraulic fracturing operations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to their operations. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict the performance of or prohibit the well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state, local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, natural gas prices in North America could rise, which in turn could materially adversely affect the relative pricing advantage that has existed in recent years in favor of domestic natural gas prices (based on Henry Hub pricing). Increased regulation or difficulty in permitting of hydraulic fracturing, and any corresponding increase in domestic natural gas prices, could materially adversely affect demand for LNG exports and our ability to develop commercially viable LNG export facilities beyond the three-train Cameron LNG facility currently under construction.\nOur businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected by these risks.\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities that we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions. Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities can result from multiple factors, such as adverse weather conditions, commodity production levels, and energy and environmental regulations and legislation.\nWhen our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, they are exposed to inflationary pressures such as rising commodity prices and interest rate risks.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials, equipment and commodities, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. We may try to mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, providing for cost escalation, providing for direct pass-through of operating costs or entering into hedges. However, these measures, if implemented, may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs. The failure to fully or substantially offset these increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations.\nIncreased competition and changes in trade policies could materially adversely affect us.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments have been characterized by strong and increasing competition both with respect to winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. In Mexico, despite the commissioning of many new energy infrastructure projects by the CFE and other governmental agencies in connection with energy reforms, competition for recent pipeline projects has been intense with numerous bidders competing aggressively for these projects. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in bidding for new development opportunities in the U.S. and Mexico. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition, the current U.S. Administration has indicated its intention to revise or replace international trade agreements, such as NAFTA. In November 2018, President Trump signed the USMCA, which, if approved by the legislatures of the U.S., Mexico and Canada, would replace NAFTA. The U.S. and Mexico approved the USMCA in January 2020 and June 2019, respectively, but Canada has yet to provide its approval. A shift in U.S. trade policies could materially adversely affect our LNG development opportunities, as well as opportunities for trade between Mexico and the U.S.\nWe may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into, extend or replace expiring long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our\nbusinesses to increased competition. Such long-term contracts, once entered into, increase our credit risk if our counterparties fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise.\nThe ECA LNG Regasification facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties. Under these agreements, customers pay capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customers\u2019 LNG. We also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. If the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the ECA LNG Regasification facility were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFor the three-train liquefaction facility currently under construction by Cameron LNG, Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TOTAL S.A., Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., that subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the facility. If the counterparties to these tolling agreements were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations to Cameron LNG JV on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG\u2019s ability to enter into or replace existing long-term firm capacity agreements for their natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include our LNG facilities. A significant sustained decrease in demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Mexico\u2019s facilities are capable of producing or to sell it at favorable prices, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers and suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses, and the businesses that we invest in, are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements or arrangements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements or arrangements. Should they fail to perform, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such an event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, many such agreements are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects. Finally, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.\nCertain past assertions made by the CFE and Mexican government, coupled with past arbitration requests and other statements and actions by the CFE, raise serious concerns over whether the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts will be honored or disputed in arbitration. The failure by the CFE or other customers to honor the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts and the inability to enter into gas pipeline contracts in the future could have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSempra Mexico\u2019s and Sempra LNG\u2019s obligations and those of their suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to (1) suspension or termination for \u201cforce majeure\u201d events beyond the control of the parties; and (2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements, which in either event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.\nIn addition, we may develop and/or own some projects with other equity owners and, therefore, we may not control all material decisions with respect to those projects, as is the case with the Cameron LNG JV project. To the extent that there is disagreement amongst the project equity owners with respect to certain decisions affecting such a project, the development, construction or\noperation of such project may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected. Such a circumstance could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, result of operations and/or prospects.\nOur businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits.\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the properties adjacent to and properties where our ECA LNG Regasification facility and ECA LNG JV proposed liquefaction project in Mexico are located, as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties on which these current and proposed facilities are located, we could lose our rights to occupy and use such properties and the related facilities, which could result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts that we have entered into with respect to such facilities. In addition, our ability to construct an LNG liquefaction export facility may be hindered or halted by these disputes, and they could make project financing such a facility and finding suitable partners and customers very difficult. If we are unable to occupy and use such properties and the related facilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity.\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:\n\u25aa\ndeliver the natural gas and electricity we sell to wholesale markets or that we use for our liquefaction facilities;\n\u25aa\nsupply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities; and\n\u25aa\nprovide retail energy services to customers.\nSempra Mexico and Sempra LNG also depend on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra Mexico and Sempra LNG also rely on specialized ships to transport LNG to their facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. Sempra Mexico\u2019s subsidiaries, as well as our South American businesses that are held for sale, rely on transmission lines to sell electricity to their customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity, natural gas supplies and LNG at then-current spot market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nOur international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges.\nIn Mexico, we own or have interests in natural gas distribution and transportation assets, LPG storage and transportation facilities, ethane transportation assets, electricity generation facilities, LNG facilities and ethane and liquid fuels marine and inland terminals. In Peru and Chile, we own or have interests in electric transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure and operations, which are held for sale. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant security, political, legal, regulatory and financial risks that vary by country, including:\n\u25aa\nchanges in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations, in each case, that are related to foreign operations;\n\u25aa\nactions by local regulatory bodies, including setting of rates and tariffs that may be earned by our businesses;\n\u25aa\nadverse changes in market conditions, trade restrictions, limitations on ownership in foreign countries and inadequate enforcement of regulations;\n\u25aa\nforeign cash balances that may be unavailable to fund U.S. operations, or available only at unfavorable U.S. and/or foreign tax rates upon repatriation of such amounts or changes in tax law;\n\u25aa\npermitting and regulatory compliance;\n\u25aa\nadverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits and approvals, difficulty in enforcing contractual and property rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico;\n\u25aa\nenergy policy reform that may result in adverse changes to and/or difficulty in enforcing existing contracts, as we discuss below;\n\u25aa\nexpropriation or theft of assets;\n\u25aa\nadverse changes in the stability of the governments in the countries in which we operate;\n\u25aa\nsocial unrest; and\n\u25aa\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws.\nIn addition, the Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly, Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and certain governmental agencies, including the CFE\ncould have a significant impact on Mexican private sector entities in general and on IEnova\u2019s operations in particular. For example, the CFE and the Mexican government took certain actions in 2019 that raised serious concerns over whether the terms of Sempra Mexico\u2019s gas pipeline contracts would be honored or disputed in arbitration. IEnova and other affected natural gas pipeline developers joined the CFE and the President of Mexico\u2019s representatives in negotiations and were able to resolve the dispute, but we cannot predict whether similar disputes may arise and/or whether such disputes will be resolved on favorable terms to us, if at all. We also cannot predict the impact that the political landscape, including multiparty rule and civil disobedience, will have on the Mexican economy. Such circumstances, may materially adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects in Mexico, which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nWe discuss litigation related to Sempra Mexico\u2019s international energy projects in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Risks\nSempra Energy has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses that it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.\nSempra Energy makes investments in entities that we do not control or manage or in which we share control. As described above, SDG&E holds a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, which is in the process of being decommissioned by Edison, its majority owner. As a result of ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, we account for our indirect, 100% ownership interest in Oncor Holdings, which, at December 31, 2019, owns an 80.25% interest in Oncor, as an equity method investment. Sempra LNG accounts for its 50.2% interest in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. Sempra Mexico has a 40% interest in a JV with a subsidiary of TC Energy to build, own and operate the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas marine pipeline in Mexico, a 50% interest in a renewables wind project in Baja California, and a 50% interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline in Mexico. Sempra Energy has an equity method investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities partnership, which is in the process of being dissolved and for which Sempra Energy is subject to certain indemnities as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Any adverse resolution of matters associated with our ownership interest in the RBS Sempra Commodities partnership could have a corresponding impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nSempra LNG provided guarantees related to Cameron LNG JV\u2019s financing agreements, and Sempra Mexico has provided loans to JVs in which they have investments. We discuss the guarantees in Note 6 and affiliate loans in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have limited influence over these ventures and other businesses in which we do not have a controlling interest. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss our investments further in Notes 5, 6 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require Sempra Energy, SDG&E and/or SoCalGas to make significant unplanned contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nSempra Energy, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. A decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the funding requirements for these plans. In addition, the cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including the assumed rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, levels of assumed interest rates and future governmental regulation. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nImpairment of goodwill would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Sempra Energy had approximately $1,602 million of goodwill, which represented approximately 2.44% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to the acquisitions of IEnova Pipelines and Ventika in Mexico. Goodwill is not amortized, but we test it for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation, which could result in our recording a goodwill impairment loss. We discuss our annual goodwill impairment testing process and the factors considered in such testing in \u201cItem 7. MD&A - Critical\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A goodwill impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which such charge is recorded.", "PERMNO": 86136, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "SRE"}
