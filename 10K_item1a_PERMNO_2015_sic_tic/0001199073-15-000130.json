{"cik": "276720", "company": "PURE CYCLE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following section describes the material risks and uncertainties that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report, including the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto.\nOur net losses may continue and we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations or other capital resources to pursue our business objectives. We have experienced significant net losses, our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our operations in the past and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital to remain in operation. Since 2004, we have obtained $76.2 million through (i) the issuance of $25.2 million of common stock (includes the issuance of stock pursuant to the exercise of options, net of expenses), (ii) the issuance of $5.2 million of Convertible Debt, which was converted to common stock on January 11, 2011, and (iii) the sale of our Arkansas River water and land for approximately $45.8 million in cash. Our ability to fund our operational needs and meet our business objectives will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations. We currently have a limited number of customers. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water delivery systems, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities, or seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital. Economic conditions and disruptions have previously caused substantial volatility in capital markets, including credit markets and the banking industry, increasing the cost and significantly reducing the availability of financing, which may reoccur in the future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe rates the District is allowed to charge customers on the Lowry Range are limited by the Lease with the Land Board and our contract with the District and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation. The prices charged by the District for water service on the Lowry Range are subject to pricing regulations set forth in the Lease with the Land Board. Both the tap fees and usage rates and charges are capped at the average of the rates of three nearby water providers. Annually the District surveys the tap fees and rates of the three nearby providers and the District may adjust tap fees and rates and charges for water service on the Lowry Range based on the average of those charged by this group, and we receive 98% of whatever the District charges its customers. Our costs associated with the construction of water delivery systems and the production, treatment and delivery of water are subject to market conditions and other factors, which may increase at a significantly greater rate than the fees we receive from the District. Factors beyond our control and which cannot be predicted, such as government regulations, insurance and labor markets, drought, water contamination and severe weather conditions, like tornadoes and floods, may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be recoverable under the current rate structure. Either increased customer demand or increased water conservation may also impact the overall cost of our operations. If the costs for construction and operation of our wholesale water services, including the cost of extracting our groundwater, exceed our revenues, we would be providing service to the District for use at the Lowry Range at a loss. The District may petition the Land Board for rate increases; however, there can be no assurance that the Land Board would approve a rate increase request. Further, even if a rate increase were approved, it might not be granted in a timely manner or in an amount sufficient to cover the expenses for which the rate increase was sought.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather conditions that could affect demand for our water service and our revenues. We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers and their end-use customers and to continue our expansion efforts. Conditions beyond our control may interfere with our water supply sources. Drought and overuse may limit the availability of water. These factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. Additionally, cool and wet weather, as well as drought restrictions and our customers' conservation efforts, may reduce consumption demands, also adversely affecting our revenue and earnings. Furthermore, freezing weather may contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage. If we experience an interruption in our water supply, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with cooling systems, irrigation systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected or there is more rainfall than expected, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nSales to the fracking industry could be curtailed or eliminated in the future. Our water sales are highly concentrated directly and indirectly with one company providing fracking services to the oil and gas industry on and around the Lowry Range and our Sky Ranch property. Regulations, fracking technologies, and the success of the wells are conditions that could limit or eliminate our sales to this customer base as well as renewals of our oil and gas leases, if any, in the future. Investment in oil and gas development is dependent on the price of oil and, recently, the price of oil has decreased significantly and has remained at relatively low levels. These sales essentially ceased in March 2015, and we have no contractual commitment that will ensure these sales will resume in the future.\nWe are dependent on the housing market and development in our targeted service areas for future revenues. Providing wholesale water service using our Colorado Front Range water supplies is our principal source of future revenue. The timing and amount of these revenues will depend significantly on housing developments being built near our water assets. The development of these areas is not within our control, and there can be no assurance that development will occur or that water sales will occur on acceptable terms or in the amounts or time required for us to support our costs of operation. In the event wholesale water sales are not forthcoming or development on the Lowry Range, Sky Ranch or other developments in our targeted service areas is delayed indefinitely, we may need to use our capital resources, incur additional short or long-term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity, and there are no assurances that we would have sufficient capital resources or be successful in obtaining additional operating capital. After several years of significant declines in new home construction, there have been positive market gains in the Colorado housing market since 2013. However, if the downturn in the homebuilding and credit markets return or if the national economy weakens and economic concerns intensify, it could have a significant negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nDevelopment on the Lowry Range is not within our control and is subject to obstacles. Development on the Lowry Range is controlled by the Land Board, which consists of a five person citizen group representing education, agriculture, local government and natural resources, plus one at-large commissioner, each appointed for a four-year term by the Colorado governor and approved by the Colorado Senate. The Land Board's focus with respect to issues such as development and conservation on the Lowry Range tends to change as membership on the Land Board changes. In addition, there are often significant delays in the adoption and implementation of plans with respect to property administered by the Land Board because the process involves many constituencies with diverse interests. In the event water sales are not forthcoming or development of the Lowry Range is delayed or abandoned, we may need to use our capital resources, incur additional short or long-term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity, and there are no assurances that we would have sufficient capital resources or be successful in obtaining additional operating capital.\nBecause of the prior use of the Lowry Range as a military facility, environmental clean-up may be required prior to development, including the removal of unexploded ordnance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting unexploded ordnance removal activities at the Lowry Range for more than 20 years. Continued activities are dependent on federal appropriations, and the Army Corps of Engineers has no assurance from year to year of such appropriations for its activities at the Lowry Range.\nOur construction of water and wastewater projects may expose us to certain completion, performance and financial risks. We intend to rely on independent contractors to construct our water and wastewater facilities. These construction activities may involve risks, including shortages of materials and labor, work stoppages, labor relations disputes, weather interference, engineering, environmental, permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases. These issues could give rise to delays, cost overruns or performance deficiencies, or otherwise adversely affect the construction or operation of our water and wastewater delivery systems. In addition, we may experience quality problems in the construction of our systems and facilities, including equipment failures. We cannot assure you that we will not face claims from customers or others regarding product quality and installation of equipment placed in service by contractors.\nCertain of our contracts may be fixed-price contracts, in which we may bear all or a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under these fixed-price contracts, contract prices are established in part based on fixed, firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates. These estimates may be based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other issues. If these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate, or if circumstances change, cost overruns may occur, and our financial results would be negatively impacted. In many cases, the incurrence of these additional costs would not be within our control.\nWe may have contracts in which we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date. At times, we may guarantee that the project, when completed, will achieve certain performance standards. If we fail to complete the project as scheduled, or if we fail to meet guaranteed performance standards, we may be held responsible for cost impacts and/or penalties to the customer resulting from any delay or for the costs to alter the project to achieve the performance standards. To the extent that these events occur and are not due to circumstances for which the customer accepts responsibility or cannot be mitigated by performance bonds or the provisions of our agreements with contractors, the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and our financial results would be negatively impacted.\nOur customers may require us to secure performance and completion bonds for certain contracts and projects. The market environment for surety companies has become more risk averse. We secure performance and completion bonds for our contracts from these surety companies. To the extent we are unable to obtain bonds, we may not be awarded new contracts. We cannot assure you that we can secure performance and completion bonds when required.\nDesign, construction or system failures could result in injury to third parties or damage to property. Any losses that exceed claims against our contractors, the performance bonds and our insurance limits at such facilities could result in claims against us. In addition, if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of our services, the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us.\nWe have a limited number of employees and may not be able to manage the increasing demands of our operations. We have a limited number of employees to administer our existing assets, interface with applicable governmental bodies, market our services and plan for the construction and development of our future assets. We may not be able to maximize the value of our water assets because of our limited manpower. We depend significantly on the services of Mark W. Harding, our President and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of Mr. Harding would cause a significant interruption of our operations. The success of our future business development and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities depends on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced and qualified persons to operate and manage our business. State regulations set the training, experience and qualification standards required for our employees to operate specific water and wastewater facilities. Failure to find state-certified and qualified employees to support the operation of our facilities could put us at risk for, among other things, regulatory penalties (including fines and suspension of operations), operational errors at the facilities, improper billing and collection processes, and loss of contracts and revenues. We cannot assure you that we can successfully manage our assets and our growth.\nA failure of the water wells or distribution networks that we own or control could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation. We distribute water through a network of pipelines and store water in storage tanks and a pond. A failure of these pipelines, tanks or the pond could result in injuries and damage to property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of these pipelines, tanks, or pond may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by our contracts, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable through rates and charges, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nConflicts of interest may arise relating to the operation of the District. Our officers and employees constitute 50% of the directors of the District. Pure Cycle, along with our officers and employees and one unrelated individual, own the 40 acres that constitute the District. We have made loans to the District to fund its operations. At August 31, 2015, total principal and interest owed to us by the District was $591,200. Pursuant to our Service Agreement with the District for the provision of water services, the District retains two percent of the revenues from the sale of water to its end-use customers on the Lowry Range. Proceeds from the fee collections will initially be used to repay the District's obligations to us, but after these loans are repaid, the District is not required to use the funds to benefit Pure Cycle. We have received benefits from our activities undertaken in conjunction with the District, but conflicts may arise between our interests and those of the District, and with our officers who are acting in dual capacities in negotiating contracts to which both we and the District are parties. We expect that the District will expand when more properties are developed and become part of the District, and our officers acting as directors of the District will have fiduciary obligations to those other constituents. There can be no assurance that all conflicts will be resolved in the best interests of Pure Cycle and its shareholders. In addition, other landowners coming into the District will be eligible to vote and to serve as directors of the District. There can be no assurances that our officers and employees will remain as directors of the District or that the actions of a subsequently elected board would not have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur operations are affected by local politics and governmental procedures which are beyond our control. We operate in a highly political environment. We market our water rights to municipalities and other governmental entities run by elected or politically appointed officials. Our principal competitors are municipalities seeking to expand their sales tax base and other water districts. Various constituencies, including our competitors, developers, environmental groups, conservation groups, and agricultural interests, have competing agendas with respect to the development of water rights in Colorado, which means that decisions affecting our business are based on many factors other than economic and business considerations. Additional risks associated with dealing with governmental entities include turnover of elected and appointed officials, changes in policies from election to election, and a lack of institutional history in these entities concerning their prior courses of dealing with the Company. We spend significant time and resources educating elected officials, local authorities and others regarding our water rights and the benefits of contracting with us. Political concerns and governmental procedures and policies may hinder or delay our ability to enter into service agreements or develop our water rights or infrastructure to deliver our water. While we have worked to reduce the political risks in our business through our participation as the service provider for the District in regional cooperative resource programs, such as the SMWSA and its WISE partnership with Denver Water and Aurora Water, as well as education and communication efforts and community involvement, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nOur Lowry Range Surface water rights are \"conditional decrees\" and require findings of reasonable diligence. Our surface water interests and reservoir sites at the Lowry Range are conditionally decreed and are subject to a finding of reasonable diligence from the Colorado water court every six years. To arrive at a finding of reasonable diligence, the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of said water rights. If the water court is unable to make such a finding, we could lose the water right under review. During fiscal 2012, the Lowry Range conditional decrees were granted their first review by the water court which determined that we and the District met the diligence criteria. The water court entered a finding of reasonable diligence on the Lowry Range surface water decrees on February 11, 2012. Our next diligence period will be in February 2018. If the water court does not make a determination of reasonable diligence in 2018, it would materially adversely impact the value of our interests in the Rangeview surface water supply.\nWater quality standards are subject to regulatory change. We must provide water that meets all federal and state regulatory water quality standards and operate our water and wastewater facilities in accordance with these standards. Future changes in regulations governing the supply of drinking water and treatment of wastewater may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. With respect to service of customers on the Lowry Range, the District's rates might not be sufficient to cover the cost of compliance with additional or more stringent requirements. If the cost of compliance were to increase, we anticipate that the rates of the nearby water providers that the District uses to establish its rates and charges would increase to reflect these cost increases, thereby allowing the District to increase its rates and charges. However, there can be no assurance that these water providers would raise their rates in an amount that would be sufficient to enable the District (and us) to cover any increased compliance costs.\nIn October 2009, the Water Quality Control Division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment advised us of proposed changes to the discharge permit for the District's Coal Creek wastewater reclamation facility. The revised permit requires compliance with effluent ammonia limitations, use of E. coli rather than fecal coliform as an indicator of effluent disinfection efficacy, and a more stringent (lower) effluent chlorine residual limitation. The revised permit requires us to comply with the new criteria by April 2016. Although we anticipate being able to comply with the revised permit, there can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with future requirements or that the cost of such compliance will be covered by the rate structure required by the Rangeview Water Agreements.\nContamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from naturally occurring compounds, pollution from man-made sources and intentional sabotage. Our land at Sky Ranch and a portion of the Lowry Range have been leased for oil and gas exploration and development. Such exploration and development could expose us to additional contamination risks. In addition, we handle certain hazardous materials at our water treatment facilities, primarily sodium hypochlorite. Any failure of our operation of the facilities or any contamination of our supplies, including sewage spills, noncompliance with water quality standards, hazardous materials leaks and spills, and similar events could expose us to environmental liabilities, claims and litigation costs. If any of these events occur, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply from another source or treat the contaminated supply. We cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates.\nWe could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs could assert personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Although we have not been a party to any environmental or pollution-related lawsuits, such lawsuits have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to an environmental or pollution-related lawsuit, we might incur significant legal costs, and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. Our insurance policies may not cover or provide sufficient coverage for the costs of these claims.\nWe may be adversely affected by any future decision by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to regulate us as a public utility. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\") regulates investor-owned water companies operating for the purpose of supplying water to the public. The CPUC regulates many aspects of public utilities' operations, including establishing water rates and fees, initiating inspections, enforcement and compliance activities and assisting consumers with complaints. We do not believe we are a public utility under Colorado law. We currently provide services by contract mainly to the District, which supplies the public. Quasi-municipal metropolitan districts, such as the District, are exempt by statute from regulation by the CPUC. However, the CPUC could attempt to regulate us as a public utility. If this were to occur, we might incur significant expense challenging the CPUC's assertion of jurisdiction, and we may be unsuccessful. In the future, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities. If we become regulated as a public utility, our ability to generate profits could be limited and we might incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance.\nThe District's and our rights under the Lease have been challenged by third parties. The District's and our rights under the Lease have been challenged by third parties, including the Land Board in the past. In 2014, in connection with settling a lawsuit filed by us and the District against the Land Board, the Land Board, the District and we amended and restated the Lease to clarify and update a number of provisions. However, there are issues still subject to negotiation and it is likely that during the remaining 66-year term of the Lease the parties will disagree over interpretations of provisions in the Lease again. There can be no assurance that the District's or our rights under the Lease will not be challenged in the future, which could require potentially expensive litigation to enforce our rights.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly being required to register as an investment company. On August 18, 2015, we completed the sale of our Arkansas River water properties and water rights for approximately $45.8 million in cash. The net proceeds from the sale of the Arkansas River water properties and water rights, which currently represents 51% of our total assets, are currently invested in money market accounts, which are not regarded as \"investment securities\" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\"). Although our board of directors believes that we are not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being primarily engaged in those activities, we could fall within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act if the net proceeds from the sale of the Arkansas River water properties and water rights and other cash and cash equivalents are invested in investment securities (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and such investment securities represent more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of cash and certain cash equivalents). A company that falls within the scope of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act can avoid being regulated as an investment company if it can rely on certain of the exclusions from being deemed to be an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion is Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, which provides that a company is deemed not to be an investment company during a period of time not to exceed one year provided that the company has a bona fide intent to be engaged primarily, as soon as is reasonably possible (in any event by the termination of such period of time), in a business other than that of an investment company. If necessary, our board of directors would explore transactions pursuant to which we would cease to be deemed to be an investment company, such as the disposition of our investment securities, including through liquidation, or the acquisition of sufficient assets that are not investment securities in order for us not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There can be no assurance that we would be able to complete such actions by the applicable deadline, or at all. If we were required to register as an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future. Our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant fluctuations in the future depending upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors that could affect our stock price and trading volume include, among others, the perceived prospects of our business; differences between anticipated and actual operating results; changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; the commencement and/or results of litigation and other legal proceedings; and future sales of our common stock by us or by significant shareholders, officers and directors. In addition, stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume volatility from time to time, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our performance.", "PERMNO": 64742, "SIC": 4950, "TIC": "PCYO"}
