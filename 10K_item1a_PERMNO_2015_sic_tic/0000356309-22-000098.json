RISK FACTORS\nWhen considering any investment in our securities, investors should consider the following risk factors, as well as the information contained under the caption \u201cInformation Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d in analyzing our present and future business performance. While this list is not exhaustive, management also places no priority or likelihood based on their descriptions or order of presentation. Listed below, not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence, are the most significant risk factors applicable to us. Unless indicated otherwise or the content requires otherwise, references below to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d should be read to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nRisk Related to Our Business Operations\nOur investments in solar energy projects are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\nOur investments in commercial and residential solar energy projects are dependent, in part, upon current state regulatory incentives and federal tax credits in order for the projects to be economically viable. Our return on investment for these solar projects is based substantially on our eligibility for ITCs and the future market value of SRECs that are traded in a competitive marketplace in the State of New Jersey. These projects face the risk that the current state regulatory programs and tax laws may expire or be adversely modified. A sustained decrease in the value of SRECs could negatively impact the return on our investments and could impair our portfolio of solar assets.\nIn addition, there are risks associated with our ability to execute on our investment strategy of clean energy projects, which includes our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably, including logistical risks and potential delays related to construction, permitting, regulatory approvals (including any approvals by the BPU required pursuant to solar energy legislation in the State of New Jersey, and similar approvals required by the States of Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York) and electric grid interconnection delays associated with the PJM Interconnection, LLC queue reform process, as well as the operational risk that the projects in service will not perform according to expectations due to equipment failure, suboptimal weather conditions or other economic factors beyond our control. All of the aforementioned risks could reduce the availability of viable solar energy projects for development. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered or inaccurate and the projects may not perform as predicted.\nWe may be unable to obtain governmental approvals, property rights and/or financing for the construction, development and operation of our proposed energy investments and projects in a timely manner or at all.\nConstruction, development and operation of energy investments, such as Leaf River and other natural gas storage facilities, NJNG infrastructure improvements, pipeline transportation systems, such as the Adelphia Gateway pipeline project, and solar energy projects, are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private property owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses for such facilities and systems. We or our joint venture partnerships may be unable to obtain, in a cost-efficient or timely manner, all such needed property rights, permits and licenses to successfully construct and develop our energy facilities and systems. Successful financing of our energy investments requires participation by willing financial institutions and lenders, as well as acquisition of capital at favorable interest rates. If we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, property rights and financing, our equity method investments could be impaired. Such impairment could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNJNG and Energy Services rely on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which they do not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\nNJNG and Energy Services depend on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. Their ability to provide natural gas for their present and projected sales will depend upon their suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain and deliver additional supplies of natural gas, as well as NJNG\u2019s ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of NJNG, its suppliers and the independent suppliers that have obligations to provide natural gas to certain NJNG customers may affect NJNG\u2019s ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties\u2019 control over the drilling of new wells and the facilities to transport natural gas to NJNG\u2019s citygate stations; development of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure; availability of supply sources; third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering or transportation system, such as the TETCO or Transcontinental Pipeline, becoming partially or fully unavailable; competition for the acquisition of natural gas; priority allocations; impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies; and the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. Energy Services also relies on a firm supply source to meet its energy management obligations to its customers. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of NJNG and Energy Services to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered. As a result, they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. Particularly for Energy Services, these conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nEnergy Services\u2019 earnings and cash flows are dependent upon optimization of its physical assets.\nEnergy Services\u2019 earnings and cash flows are based, in part, on its ability to optimize its portfolio of contractually based natural gas storage and pipeline assets. The optimization strategy involves utilizing its physical assets to take advantage of differences in natural gas prices between geographic locations and/or time periods. Any change among various pricing points could affect these differentials. In addition, significant increases in the supply of natural gas in Energy Services\u2019 market areas, including as a result of increased production along the Marcellus Shale, can reduce Energy Services\u2019 ability to take advantage of pricing fluctuations in the future. Changes in pricing dynamics and supply could have an adverse impact on Energy Services\u2019 optimization activities, earnings and cash flows. Energy Services incurs fixed demand fees to acquire its contractual rights to transportation and storage assets. Should commodity prices at various locations or time periods change in such a way that Energy Services is not able to recoup these costs from its customers, the cash flows and earnings at Energy Services, and ultimately the Company, could be adversely impacted.\nWeather and weather patterns, including normal seasonal and quarterly fluctuations of weather, as well as extreme weather events that, individually or in aggregate, may be associated with climate change, could adversely affect our ability to manage our operational requirements to serve our customers, and ultimately adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nNJNG\u2019s business is seasonal, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our financial performance. Demand for natural gas is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our market areas, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and second quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters or cool summers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, exceptionally hot summer weather or unusually cold winter weather could add significantly to working capital needs to fund higher than normal supply purchases to meet customer demand for natural gas. While we believe the CIP mitigates the impact of weather variations on NJNG\u2019s Utility Gross Margin, severe weather conditions may have an impact on the ability of suppliers and pipelines to deliver the natural gas to NJNG, which can negatively affect our earnings. The CIP does not mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions on our cash flows.\nFuture results at Energy Services are subject to volatility in the natural gas market due to weather. Variations in weather may affect earnings and working capital needs throughout the year. During periods of milder temperatures, demand and volatility in the natural gas market may decrease, which can negatively impact Energy Services\u2019 earnings and cash flows.\nSevere weather impacts, including but not limited to, hurricanes, thunderstorms, high winds, microbursts, fires, tornadoes, blizzards, and snow or ice storms, can disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution. Extreme weather conditions, especially those of prolonged duration, create high energy demand on our own and/or other systems and increase the risk we may be unable to reliably serve customers. Risk of losing gas supply during extreme weather carries significant consequences, as without our services our customers may be subjected to dire circumstances. Additionally, extreme weather conditions may cause the breakdown of or damage to equipment essential to the operation of our assets, and could also raise market prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. In addition, we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\nThere is also a concern that the physical risks of climate change could include changes in weather conditions, such as changes in the amount or type of precipitation and extreme weather events. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the cost incurred in providing natural gas, impacting the demand for and consumption of natural gas (due to change in both costs and weather patterns) and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect operations.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. NJNG and the Union recently negotiated an extension of their current collective bargaining agreement extending the term through December 7, 2023. The collective bargaining agreement between NJRHS and the Union is scheduled to expire April 2, 2024. Disputes with the Union over terms and conditions of the agreements could result in instability in our labor relationship and work stoppages that could impair the timely delivery of natural gas and other services from our utility and Home Services business, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our collective bargaining agreements may also increase the cost of employing Natural Gas Distribution and Home Services workforce, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and employee benefits, limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce and limit our ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today\u2019s challenging marketplace.\nOur success as a company depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel to develop, implement and execute on our overall business strategy. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations.\nRisk Related to Technologies\nCyberattacks or failure of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to place ever-greater reliance on technological tools that support our business operations and corporate functions, including tools that help us manage our natural gas distribution and energy trading operations and infrastructure. The failure of, or security breaches related to, these technologies could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology to manage our natural gas distribution and storage, energy trading and other corporate operations; maintain customer, employee, Company and vendor data; and prepare our financial statements and perform other critical business processes. This technology may fail due to cyberattack, physical disruption, design and implementation defects or human error. Disruption or failure of business operations and information technology systems could harm our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, serve our customers effectively or manage our assets. Additionally, an attack on, or failure of, information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data. Recent widespread ransomware attacks and cybersecurity breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have affected many companies, including the cybersecurity incident involving SolarWinds Orion in December 2020. While these attacks did not affect our business operations, future events of this kind could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability.\nThere is no guarantee that redundancies built into our networks and technology, or the procedures we have implemented to protect against cyberattacks and other unauthorized access to secured data, will guarantee protection against all failures of technology or security breaches. Furthermore, despite our efforts to investigate, improve and remediate the capability and performance of our information technology system, we may not be able to discover all weaknesses, breaches and vulnerabilities, and failure to do so may expose us to higher risk of data loss and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change may limit customer growth and have an adverse effect on our operations.\nAdvances in technology and changes in laws or regulations are reducing the cost of alternative methods of producing energy. In addition, customers are increasingly expecting enhanced communications regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, may involve additional investments in technology. New technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes and to offer services that meet customer demand. Failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Extreme Events\nThe Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to risk associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially and adversely impact our business, including our financial condition, results from operations, liquidity, cash flows and the market value of our common stock.\nThe effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the rise of COVID-19 mutations and related government responses, could include, and have at times included, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. The potential prolonged impacts that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have on our future operating results and liquidity include the following:\n\u2022impacts related to the health, safety, productivity and availability of our employees and contractors;\n\u2022reduced demand for energy and forecasted customer growth;\n\u2022our ability to develop, construct and operate facilities;\n\u2022impacts of a resurgence of infections, including the risk that a large proportion of our employees in essential capacities contract COVID-19\n\u2022suspension of collection activities and the inability to shutoff natural gas services for nonpayment;\n\u2022reduced demand for commercial, industrial and residential natural gas services;\n\u2022deterioration of the credit quality of our counterparties;\n\u2022increases in costs and supply chain delays and disruptions;\n\u2022delays and disruptions to capital construction and infrastructure operations and maintenance programs, including delays in the permitting process and base rate cases;\n\u2022delays and disruptions to financing plans and increasing costs related thereto;\n\u2022impacts on pension valuations and increased pension and post-retirement plan costs and funding requirements;\n\u2022deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that impacts our credit ratings;\n\u2022impacts to our liquidity position and the cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets;\n\u2022impacts on our legal and regulatory matters, including the potential for delayed state regulatory filings and recovery of invested capital, as well as delays in newly enacted and proposed state regulatory actions and federal laws;\n\u2022exacerbation of other risks that may impact us; and\n\u2022other unpredictable events.\nThese uncertain economic conditions have also impacted the ability of certain customers to pay for utility and certain nonutility services, which could affect the collectability and recognition of our revenues and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe situation surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, and the likelihood of material impacts may increase the longer the pandemic impacts activity levels in the U.S. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict. As of September 30, 2022, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates; however, the ultimate severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses thereto are uncertain and we cannot predict whether they will have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and when and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nWe may be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemic illness (including COVID-19), war or terrorist activities and other extreme events to which we may be unable to promptly respond.\nLocal or national natural disasters, pandemic illness (including COVID-19), actual or threatened acts of war or terrorist activities, including the political and economic disruption and uncertainty related to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in our industry that are located in our service territory may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism that could target or impact our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities and disrupt our operations and ability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Natural disasters, political unrest or actual or\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nthreatened terrorist activities may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital or may impact our suppliers or our customers directly. A local disaster or pandemic illness (including COVID-19) could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to the Company. Our regulators may not allow us to recover from our customers part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA slow or inadequate response to events that could cause business interruption may have an adverse impact on operations and earnings. We may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities, catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system and other events, which could increase the risk that an event adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Related to Regulations and Litigation\nWe are subject to governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certificates may result in substantial costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local authorities. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies. These agencies regulate various aspects of our business, including customer rates, services, construction and natural gas pipeline operations.\nFERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale and retail markets and the purchase and sale of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, including Steckman Ridge, Leaf River and Adelphia Gateway. Any Congressional legislation or agency regulation that would alter these or other similar statutory and regulatory structures in a way to significantly raise costs that could not be recovered in rates from customers, that would reduce the availability of supply or capacity or that would reduce our competitiveness could negatively impact our earnings. In addition, changes in and compliance with laws such as the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 could increase federal regulatory oversight and administrative costs that may not be recovered in rates from customers, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe cannot predict the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and applicable regulations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could influence our operating environment and may result in substantial costs to us.\nOur costs of compliance with present and future environmental laws are significant and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to expend financial resources to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if we are unable to do so due to factors beyond our control, we may be subject to civil liabilities or criminal penalties and may be required to incur expenditures to come into compliance. Additionally, any alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend resources in our defense against alleged violations.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Congress has for some time been considering various forms of climate change legislation. In addition, in July 2019, the State of New Jersey amended the GWRA, which targets 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2006 levels economy-wide by 2050. In January 2020, Governor Murphy released the EMP confirming his commitment to achieve 100 percent clean energy by 2050, and the GWRA mandate of reducing state greenhouse gas emissions. The EMP addressed New Jersey\u2019s energy system, including electric generation, transportation and buildings, and their associated greenhouse gas emissions and related air pollutants. The EMP defines 100 percent clean energy by 2050 to mean 100 percent carbon-neutral electric generation and maximum electrification of the transportation and building sectors, which are the greatest carbon emission producing sectors in the state, to meet or exceed the GWRA emissions reductions by 2050. Our goals, to reduce our New Jersey operational emissions by 50 percent from 2006 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from our New Jersey operations by 2050, may require additional technological, legislative and regulatory developments, the impacts and costs of which may not be fully known at this time.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nTo underpin the initiatives in the EMP, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order No. 100, directing the Department of Environmental Protection to make sweeping regulatory reforms, branded as Protecting Against Climate Threats, to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. These regulations have begun to be promulgated, and NJR is taking an active role in participating in these rulemaking processes. While the EMP does not place a moratorium or end date on natural gas hook ups, further legislation or rulemaking that de-emphasizes the role of natural gas in providing clean, low-cost energy in the state of New Jersey which could put upward pressure on natural gas prices and place customer growth targets at risk. Higher cost levels could impact the competitive position of natural gas and negatively affect our growth opportunities, cash flows and earnings.\nRisks related to regulation could affect the rates we are able to charge, various costs and our profitability.\nNJNG is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. These authorities regulate many aspects of NJNG\u2019s distribution and transmission operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, tariff rates that NJNG can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs and relationships with its affiliates. NJNG\u2019s ability to timely construct rate-based assets and obtain rate increases, including base rate increases, extend its BGSS incentive and CIP programs and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, NJR began the process of transitioning away from its enterprise platform, which will no longer receive extended support after 2025. The first phase of IT enhancements and upgrades were placed into service in July 2020. The remaining phases of planned upgrades relate to work order and asset management and customer information systems and experience which are expected to require significant capital investment through fiscal year 2024. There can be no assurance that NJNG will be able to obtain rate increases and continue its BGSS incentive, CIP, RAC, or SAVEGREEN programs and IT upgrades and enhancements or continue to earn its currently authorized rates of return.\nAdelphia is subject to regulation by FERC. FERC regulates many aspects of Adelphia\u2019s transmission operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety tariff rates that Adelphia can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement and relations with its affiliates. Adelphia\u2019s ability to obtain rate increases and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions. There can be no assurance that Adelphia will be able to obtain rate increases or continue to earn its currently authorized rate of return.\nOur regulated operations are subject to certain operating risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas.\nOur regulated operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas, including our natural gas vehicle refueling stations and LNG facilities. These risks include catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, storms, safety issues and other adverse weather conditions and hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of facilities or damage to persons and property. We could suffer substantial losses should any of these events occur. Moreover, as a result, we have been, and likely will be, a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we maintain insurance coverage, insurance may not be sufficient to cover all material expenses related to these risks.\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary conduct of business, we are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, permitting, taxes, environmental issues, natural gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require us to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in our financial statements or are not covered by insurance or indemnity rights, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nRisk Related to Acquisition and Investment Strategies\nAny acquisitions that we may undertake involve risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities as a result of these transactions.\nThe integration of acquisitions require significant time and resources. Investments of resources are required to support any acquisition, which could result in significant ongoing operating expenses, and we may experience challenges when combining separate business cultures, information technology systems and employees, and those challenges may divert senior management\u2019s time and attention. If we fail to successfully integrate assets and liabilities through the entities which we acquire, we may not fully realize all of the growth opportunities, benefits expected from the transaction, cost savings and other synergies and, as a result, the fair value of assets acquired could be impaired. We assess long-lived assets, including intangible assets associated with acquisitions, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of long-lived assets become impaired, the impairment charges could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe benefits that we expect to achieve from acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and other synergies with our existing businesses. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions within our existing businesses in a timely and seamless manner. We may experience challenges when combining separate business cultures, information technology systems and employees. Even if we are able to complete an integration successfully, we may not fully realize all the growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies that we expect.\nInvesting through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk.\nWe have utilized joint ventures through partnerships for certain Storage and Transportation investments. Although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire interests in other joint ventures or partnerships in the future. In these joint ventures or partnerships, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or partnerships, and other participants or investors may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of NJR and our subsidiaries and affiliates. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interests.\nRisk Related to our Markets\nWe are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in our wholesale business.\nOur transportation and storage portfolios consist of contracts to transport and store natural gas. The value of our transportation and storage portfolio could be negatively impacted if the value of these contracts changes in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate. In addition, upon expiration of these transportation and storage contracts, to the extent that they are renewed or replaced at less favorable terms, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nMajor changes in the supply and price of natural gas may affect financial results.\nWhile NJRES and NJNG expect to meet customers\u2019 demand for natural gas for the foreseeable future, factors affecting suppliers and other third parties, including the inability to develop additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, lack of supply sources, increased competition, further deregulation, transportation costs, possible climate change legislation, energy efficiency mandates or changes in consumer behaviors, transportation availability and drilling for new natural gas resources, may impact the supply and price of natural gas. In addition, any significant disruption in the availability of supplies of natural gas could result in increased supply costs, higher prices for customers and potential supply disruptions to customers.\nNJRES and NJNG actively hedge against the fluctuation in the price of natural gas by entering into forward and financial contracts with third parties. Should these third parties fail to perform, and regulators not allow the pass-through of expended funds to customers, it may result in a loss that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nInflation and increased natural gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase The Company\u2019s level of indebtedness.\nInflation has caused, and may continue to cause, increases in certain operating and capital costs. Our regulated businesses have a process in place to review the adequacy of their rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those rates. The ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results.\nRapid increases in the price of purchased gas may cause the Company to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because it must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection from customers and counterparties for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs could also slow collection efforts as NJNG customers may be more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher-than-normal accounts receivable. This situation could also result in higher short-term debt levels and increased bad debt expense.\nChanges in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.\nNJNG\u2019s ability to increase its Utility Gross Margin is dependent upon the new construction housing market, as well as the conversion of customers to natural gas from other fuel sources. During periods of extended economic downturns, prolonged weakness in housing markets or slowdowns in the conversion market, there could be an adverse impact on NJNG\u2019s Utility Gross Margin, earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, while our estimates regarding customer growth are based in part upon information from third parties, the estimates have not been verified by an independent source and are subject to the aforementioned risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to materially deviate from the estimates.\nOur economic hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity and financial market risks, including the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business, may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and financial losses that negatively impact results of operations and our stock price.\nWe use derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to manage commodity, financial market and foreign currency risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses associated with our economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always coincide with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\nIn addition, we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.\nRisk Related to Credit and Liquidity\nNJR is a holding company and depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nNJR is a holding company with no significant assets other than possible cash investments and the stock of its operating subsidiaries. We rely exclusively on dividends from our subsidiaries, on intercompany loans from our unregulated subsidiaries, and on the repayments of principal and interest from intercompany loans and reimbursement of expenses from our subsidiaries for our cash flows. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries or the repayment of loans to us by our subsidiaries. The extent to which our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and principal and interest to holders of our debt.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nCredit rating downgrades could increase financing costs, limit access to the financial markets and negatively affect NJR and its subsidiaries.\nRating agencies Moody\u2019s and Fitch currently rate NJNG\u2019s debt as investment grade. If such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as would the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and obtaining future financing. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their current and future credit facilities. Our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing have a direct impact on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to execute their operating strategies, particularly in the case of NJNG, which relies heavily upon capital expenditures financed by its credit facility.\nIf we suffer a reduction in our credit and borrowing capacity or in our ability to issue parental guarantees, the business prospects of Energy Services, Clean Energy Ventures and Storage and Transportation, which rely on our creditworthiness, would be adversely affected. Energy Services could possibly be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts, and it may be unable to continue to trade or be able to do so only on less favorable terms with certain counterparties. Clean Energy Ventures could be required to seek alternative financing for its projects, and may be unable to obtain such financing or able to do so only on less favorable terms.\nAdditionally, lower credit ratings could adversely affect relationships with NJNG\u2019s state regulators, who may be unwilling to allow NJNG to pass along increased costs to its natural gas customers.\nIf we are unable to access the financial markets or there are adverse conditions in the equity or credit markets, it could affect management\u2019s ability to execute our business plans.\nWe rely on access to both short-term and long-term credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. Any deterioration in our financial condition could hamper our ability to access the equity or credit markets or otherwise obtain debt financing on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, because certain state regulatory approvals may be necessary for NJNG to incur debt, NJNG may be unable to access credit markets on a timely basis. External events could also increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access the financial markets. Such external events could include the following:\n\u2022economic weakness and/or political instability in the U.S. or in the regions where we operate;\n\u2022political conditions, such as a shutdown of the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022financial difficulties of unrelated energy companies;\n\u2022capital market conditions generally;\n\u2022volatility in the equity markets;\n\u2022market prices for natural gas;\n\u2022the overall health of the natural gas utility industry; and\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates and increased borrowing costs.\nOur ability to secure short-term financing is subject to conditions in the credit markets. A prolonged constriction of credit availability could affect management\u2019s ability to execute our business plan. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for both current operations and future growth.\nEnergy Services and NJNG execute derivative transactions with financial institutions as a part of their economic hedging strategy and could incur losses associated with the inability of a financial counterparty to meet or perform under its obligations as a result of adverse conditions in the credit markets or their ability to access capital or post collateral.\nFailure by NJR and/or NJNG to comply with debt covenants may impact our financial condition.\nOur long-term debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios. These debt obligations also contain provisions that put limitations on our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue certain business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, put limitations on our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our businesses, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. Furthermore, the debt obligations and our sale leaseback agreements contain covenants and other provisions requiring us to provide timely delivery of accurate financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations and/or the inability to borrow under existing revolving\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ncredit facilities and term loans. We have relied, and continue to rely, upon short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper supported by our revolving credit facilities to finance the execution of a portion of our operating strategies. NJNG is dependent on these capital sources to purchase its natural gas supply and maintain its properties. The acceleration of our outstanding debt obligations and our inability to borrow under the existing revolving credit facilities would cause a material adverse change in NJR\u2019s and NJNG\u2019s financial condition.\nRisks Related to Tax and Accounting Matters\nThe cost of providing pension and postemployment health care benefits to employees and eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values, interest rates and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have two defined benefit pension plans and two OPEB plans for the benefit of eligible full-time employees and qualified retirees, which were closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of the pension and OPEB fund assets, changing discount rates and changing actuarial assumptions based upon demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries, an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years, impacts from healthcare legislation and increases in health care costs.\nSignificant declines in equity markets and/or reductions in bond yields can have a material adverse effect on the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize increased pension and OPEB expenses and/or be required to make additional cash contributions into the plans.\nThe funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. A significant decrease in the asset values of these plans can result in funding obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations, decrease our borrowing capacity and increase our interest expense.\nChanges in tax laws, rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations by tax authorities may negatively affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation and audit by various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels. We cannot predict how our federal and state regulators will apply such tax changes in our future rates. While we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws, rules, and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes, which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities.\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the United States, which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law and imposed a 15 percent minimum tax rate on book earnings for corporations with higher than $1 billion of annual income, along with a 1 percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases while providing tax incentives to promote various clean energy initiatives. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes.\nAny future change in tax laws or interpretation of such laws could adversely affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.\nA valuation allowance may be required for our deferred tax assets.\nDuring fiscal 2018, as a result of the Tax Act\u2019s decrease to the federal statutory corporate tax rate, and during fiscal 2020, as a result of Corporate Business Tax reform in the state of New Jersey, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the enactment date to reflect the rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are realized or settled. These adjustments are based on assumptions we made with respect to our book versus tax differences and the timing of when those differences will reverse. Our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of investment tax credits and state net operating losses. Any further revaluation of our deferred tax assets that may be required in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nSignificant regulatory assets recorded by our regulated companies could be disallowed for recovery from customers in the future.\nNJNG records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the BPU as allowed by GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs, which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by the BPU, would be charged to expense on its income statement in the period incurred. Primary regulatory assets that are subject to BPU approval include the recovery of BGSS and USF costs, remediation costs associated with NJNG\u2019s MGP sites, CIP, NJCEP, economic stimulus plans, certain deferred income taxes and pension and OPEB. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on NJNG\u2019s existing tariff or a future base rate case, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdelphia Gateway records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of FERC as allowed by GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs, which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by FERC, would be recorded as a charge to earnings on its Statement of Operations in the period incurred. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on Adelphia\u2019s existing rates or a future rate case, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Takeovers\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction that shareowners would view as favorable.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, as amended and amended and restated bylaws, as well as New Jersey law, contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited change in control of NJR, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. These provisions may also prevent changes in management. In addition, our Board is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as our Board may determine. Our common shareowners will be subject to, and may be negatively affected by, the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act, which could delay or prevent a change of control of NJR.\nWe may also be subject to actions or proposals from activist investors or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. This may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, cause uncertainty with our regulators and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any investor activism.", "PERMNO": 64450, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NJR"}
