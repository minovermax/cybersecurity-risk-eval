{"cik": "813920", "company": "CEC ENTERTAINMENT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business operations and the implementation of our business strategy are subject to significant risks inherent in our business, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described below. The occurrence of any one or more of the risks or uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nNegative publicity concerning food quality, health, general safety or other issues, and changes in consumer preferences, could negatively affect our brand image and reputation and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups, or government authorities, resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns, or operating issues stemming from one venue or a limited number of venues. Publicity concerning food-borne illnesses, injuries caused by food tampering, and general safety issues could negatively affect our operations, reputation and brand. Families with young children may be highly sensitive to adverse publicity that may arise from an actual or perceived negative event within one or more of our venues. We have, from time to time, received negative publicity related to altercations and other safety-related incidents in certain of our venues. There can be no assurance that in the future we will not experience negative publicity regarding one or more of our venues, and the existence of negative publicity could adversely affect our brand image and reputation with our customers and our consolidated financial results.\nThe speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with electronic communication, including social media. Many social media platforms allow for users to immediately publish content without checking the accuracy of the content posted. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such information, we may suffer declines in guest traffic, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results.\nIn addition, our industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions may cause consumers to avoid certain products we offer in favor of alternative or healthier foods. If consumer eating habits change significantly and we are unable to respond with appropriate menu offerings, it could adversely affect our brand image and consolidated financial results.\nOur business may also be impacted by certain public health issues including epidemics, pandemics and the rapid spread of certain illnesses and contagious diseases. To the extent that extensive publicity relating to such events causes our customers to feel uncomfortable visiting or taking their children to public locations, particularly locations with a large number of children, due to a perceived risk of exposure to a public health issue, we could experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nIf we are unable to successfully open new venues or appropriately update and evolve our current venue base, our business and our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase revenues and improve financial results depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully implement and refine our long-term growth strategy. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we plan to upgrade\nthe games, rides and entertainment in some of our existing venues, remodel and expand certain of our existing venues and open additional new venues in selected markets.\nThe opening and success of new Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza venues is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to the availability of suitable sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for such locations, our ability to meet construction schedules, our ability to manage such expansion and hire and train personnel to manage the new venues, our ability to obtain, for acceptable cost, building and other permits and approvals including liquor licenses, the potential cannibalization of sales at our adjacent venues located in the market, as well as general economic and business conditions. Our ability to successfully open new venues or remodel, expand or upgrade the entertainment at existing venues will also depend upon the availability of sufficient capital for such purposes, including operating cash flow, our existing credit facility, future debt financings, future equity offerings, or a combination thereof. There can also be no assurance that we will be successful in opening and operating the number of anticipated new venues on a timely or profitable basis. There can be no assurance that we can continue to successfully remodel or expand our existing facilities or upgrade the games and entertainment or obtain a reasonable return on such investments.\nOur growth is also dependent on our ability to continually evolve and update our business model to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and competitive conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changes in competitive conditions or customer preferences or that the market will accept our business model. If revenues and/or operating results are lower than our current estimates, we may incur additional charges for asset impairments in the future, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results. Additionally, we incur significant costs each time we open a new venue and other expenses when we relocate or remodel existing venues. The expenses of opening, relocating, or remodeling any of our venues may be higher than anticipated. If we are unable to open or are delayed in opening new or relocated venues, we may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. If we are unable to remodel or are delayed in remodeling venues, we may incur significant costs, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our marketing strategy, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur long-term growth is dependent on the success of strategic initiatives to effectively market and advertise our concept to our target audience. In recent years, we have made significant changes to our marketing and advertising strategy, including (a) the introduction of an updated Chuck E. Cheese character; (b) a change in the mix of our media expenditures; (c) an increase in advertising directed to parents; and (d) promoting our brand and reasons to visit through free-standing inserts in newspapers, on television, and online. There can be no assurance that these changes to our traditional media strategy, which was heavily weighted towards kids' television advertising, free-standing inserts in newspapers, and significant couponing, will be effective at reaching customers or be accepted by customers. If we are not effective in reaching our target audience with our new marketing and advertising strategy or if these changes are not accepted by guests, we may incur additional advertising costs, and our business and our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant and entertainment industries are highly competitive, and that competition could harm our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe believe that our combined restaurant and entertainment center concept puts us in a niche, which combines elements of both the restaurant and entertainment industries. As a result, we compete with entities in both industries. The family dining industry and the entertainment industry are highly competitive, with a number of major national and regional chains operating in each of these spaces. Although other restaurant brands presently utilize the concept of combined family dining-entertainment operations, we believe these competitors operate primarily on a local, regional or market-by-market basis. Within the traditional restaurant sector, we compete with other casual dining restaurants on a nationwide basis with respect to price, quality, and speed of service; type and quality of food; personnel; the number and location of restaurants; attractiveness of facilities; effectiveness of advertising; and marketing programs and new product development. To a lesser extent, our competition also includes quick service restaurants with respect to pricing, service, experience, and perceived value. Within the entertainment sector, we compete with movie theaters, bowling alleys, theme parks, and other family-oriented concepts on a nationwide basis with respect to perceived value and overall experience. Additionally, children's interests and opportunities for entertainment continue to expand. If we are unable to successfully evolve our concept, including new food and entertainment offerings, we may lose market share to our competition. These competitive market conditions, including the emergence of significant new competition, could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nEconomic uncertainty and changes in consumer discretionary spending could reduce sales at our venues and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nPurchases at our venues are discretionary for consumers; therefore, our consolidated results of operations are\nsusceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. We are dependent in particular upon discretionary spending by consumers living in the communities in which our venues are located. A significant portion of our venues are clustered in certain geographic areas. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 182 Chuck E. Cheese's venues are located in California, Texas, and Florida (179 are Company-operated and three are franchised locations), and a total of 135 Peter Piper Pizza venues are located in Arizona, Texas, and Mexico (32 are Company-operated and 103 are franchised locations). A significant weakening in the local economies of these geographic areas, or any of the areas in which our venues are located, may cause consumers to curtail discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our Company venue sales and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nThe future performance of the United States and global economies is uncertain and is directly affected by numerous national and global financial, political and other factors that are beyond our control. Our target market of families with young children can be highly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, which may impact their desire to spend discretionary dollars, resulting in lower customer traffic levels in our venues. Increases in credit card debt, home mortgage and other borrowing costs and declines in housing values could further weaken the United States, Mexican or Canadian economies, leading to a further decrease in discretionary consumer spending. In addition, reduced consumer confidence as a result of a renewed recession, job losses, home foreclosures, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit may also result in lower levels of traffic to our venues. Moreover, our customer traffic may be impacted by major changes in United States fiscal policy. Also, while the current administration\u2019s policies in many areas are still uncertain at this time, certain types of policies regarding immigration, development and investment could adversely affect our business. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect customer confidence and our business. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including at our venues, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. Further, fluctuations in the retail price of gasoline and the potential for future increases in gasoline and other energy costs may affect consumers' disposable incomes available for entertainment and dining. Changes in consumer spending habits as a result of a recession or a reduction in consumer confidence are likely to reduce our customer traffic and sales performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results. In addition, these economic factors could affect our level of spending on planned capital initiatives at our venues, and thereby impact our future sales, and could also result in potential asset impairments and venue closures.\nIncreases in food, labor, and other operating costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nFor the 2017 fiscal year, 47.3% of company venue sales revenue came from food and beverage sales as compared to the 52.7% of company venue sales revenue resulting from entertainment and merchandise sales. As a result, the performance of our venues is affected by changes in the costs for food products we purchase, including but not limited to cheese, dough, produce, chicken, and beef. The commodity prices for these food products vary throughout the year and may be affected by changes in supply, demand, and other factors beyond our control. We have not entered into any hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility associated with commodity prices; however, we typically enter into short-term purchasing arrangements, which may contain pricing designed to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations. An increase in our food costs could negatively affect our profit margins and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nSeveral states and cities in which we operate venues have established a minimum wage higher than the federally-mandated minimum wage. There may be similar increases implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate. Additionally, a number of our employees could be subject to changes in federal or state rules and regulations concerning increases to salary and compensation levels necessary for white collar workers to be classified as exempt in 2018 and beyond, as well as state-specific laws governing relative pay for male and female employees and/or employees of different ethnicities. Such changes in the minimum wage and other wage or salary requirements could increase our labor costs and could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and our consolidated financial results.\nThe performance of our venues could also be adversely affected by increases in the price of utilities on which the venues depend, such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise. Our business also incurs significant costs for, among other things, insurance, marketing, taxes, real estate, borrowing, and litigation, all of which could increase due to inflation, rising interest rates, changes in laws, competition, or other events beyond our control, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nOur strategy to open international franchised venues may not be successful and may subject us to unanticipated conditions in foreign markets, which could adversely impact our business and our ability to operate effectively in those markets.\nPart of our growth strategy depends on our ability to attract new international franchisees and the ability of these franchisees to open and operate new venues on a profitable basis. As we do not have a long history of significant international growth experience, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute this strategy in the future. Delays or failures in identifying desirable franchise partners and opening new franchised venues could adversely affect our planned\ngrowth. Moreover, our franchisees depend on the availability of financing to construct and open new venues. If these franchisees experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, our growth strategy and franchise revenues could be adversely affected. Additionally, our growth strategy depends on the ability of our international franchisees to learn and implement our business strategy, while adapting to the local culture. There can be no assurance that the Chuck E. Cheese's and Peter Piper Pizza concepts will be accepted in targeted international markets.\nCurrently, our international franchisees operate venues in 12 countries. We and our franchisees are subject to the regulatory, economic, and political conditions of any foreign market in which our franchisees operate venues. Any change in the laws, regulations, and economic and political stability of these foreign markets could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Changes in foreign markets that could affect our consolidated financial results include, but are not limited to, taxation, inflation, currency fluctuations, political instability, economic instability, war or conflicts, increased regulations and quotas, tariffs, and other protectionist measures. Additionally, our long-term growth strategy includes adding franchisees in additional foreign markets in the future. To the extent unfavorable conditions exist in the foreign markets we plan to expand into or we are unable to secure intellectual property rights sufficient to operate in such foreign markets, we and our international franchise partners may not be successful in opening the number of anticipated new venues on a timely and profitable basis. Delays or failures in opening new foreign market venue locations could adversely affect our planned growth and result in increased attendant costs.\nOur business dealings with foreign franchisees and vendors are subject to United States and foreign anti-corruption law, and investigations or enforcement actions brought under such law could adversely impact our business and our ability to operate effectively in those markets.\nAs a business that regularly enters into negotiations and contractual relationships with franchisees and vendors located in foreign countries, we are subject to the requirements of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing such activities. Although we have a strong compliance program that includes regular training and reinforcement of our employees who represent us in dealings with foreign individuals and entities on the laws impacting such dealings, we may be faced with investigations or enforcement actions by the United States or foreign governments arising from such dealings. Responding to such investigations or enforcement actions would be costly and may divert management's attention and resources from the regular operation of our business, and together with any fines, penalties, or other actions ordered by governmental authorities, could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial results.\nIf we are unable to maintain and protect our information technology systems and technologies, we could suffer disruptions in our business, damage our reputation with customers, and incur substantial costs.\nThe operation of our business is heavily dependent upon the implementation, integrity, security, and successful functioning of our computer networks and information systems, including the point-of-sales systems in our venues, data centers that process transactions, the enterprise resource planning system, the Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza brand websites, the birthday reservation system, and various software applications used in our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we also collect and store on our computer networks and information systems sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. A failure of our systems to operate effectively as a result of a cyber-attack, damage to, interruption, or failure of any of these systems could result in a failure to meet our reporting obligations, material misstatements in our financial statements, or losses due to the disruption of our business operations. These adverse situations could also lead to loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur additional development costs. While we purchase insurance coverage related to network security and privacy to limit the cost of any such failure or cyber-attack our coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all of the costs we may incur in the event of a cyber-attack. Despite our efforts to secure our computer networks and information systems, security could be compromised or confidential information could be misappropriated, resulting in a loss of customers' or employees' personal information, negative publicity or harm to our business and reputation that could cause us to incur costs to reimburse third parties for damages or to pay governmental fines, or cause a decrease in guest traffic.\nAny disruption of our commodity distribution system could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe use a network of 15 distribution centers operated by a single company to distribute most of the food products and supplies used in our domestic Chuck E. Cheese's branded venues, five distribution centers for our Canadian Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s branded venues and four distribution centers for our Peter Piper Pizza branded venues. Any failure by these distributors to adequately distribute products or supplies to our venues could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results. Although we believe that alternative third-party distributors are available for our products and supplies, we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace our distributors or obtain the necessary products and supplies from other suppliers, and there can be no assurance that our business would not be disrupted.\nOur procurement of games, rides, entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes, and merchandise is dependent upon a few global providers, the loss of any of which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur ability to continue to procure new games, rides, entertainment-related equipment, redemption prizes and merchandise is important to our business strategy. The number of suppliers from which we can purchase these items is limited due to industry consolidation over the past several years. To the extent that the number of suppliers continues to decline, we could be subject to risks of distribution delays, pricing pressure and lack of innovation, among other things. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in China, and continuing and increasing tension between the United States and Chinese governments could also result in interruptions in our ability to procure these products, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial results.\nWe purchase merchandise from third parties and offer this merchandise to customers in exchange for prize tickets or for sale. This merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to our customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, individuals may in the future assert claims or file lawsuits alleging that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside of the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to various government regulations, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nThe development and operation of our venues are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, including but not limited to those that impose restrictions, levy a fee or tax, or require a permit, license or other regulatory approval, and those that relate to the operation of redemption, video, and arcade games and rides, the preparation of food and beverages, the sale and service of alcoholic beverages, and building and zoning requirements. Difficulties or failure in obtaining required permits, licenses, or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new venue, remodel or expansion, and the suspension of, or inability to renew, a license or permit could interrupt operations at an existing venue.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including those related to minimum wage requirements, exempt status, overtime, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, immigration status requirements, child labor, and non- discrimination. Additionally, changes in federal labor laws, including card verification regulations, could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence, which could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of our venue personnel are paid at minimum wage rates established by federal, state and municipal law. Increases in the minimum wage result in higher labor costs, which may be only partially offset by price increases and operational efficiencies. We are also subject to certain laws and regulations that govern our handling of customers' personal information. A failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers' personal information could expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement action, as well as materially damage our reputation.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We believe that our franchise disclosure document, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.\nWhile we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, governmental and regulatory bodies may change such laws and regulations in the future, which may require us to incur substantial cost increases. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions, penalties, fines and/or lawsuits, or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, employees, franchisees and other third parties in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former employees, franchisees, suppliers, governmental entities, stockholders, or others, through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our food or entertainment offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. From time to time, we are also involved in lawsuits with respect to alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights, as well as challenges to our intellectual property.\nWe are also subject to risks from litigation and regulatory action regarding advertising to our market of children between the ages of two and 12 years old. In addition, since certain of our venues serve alcoholic beverages, we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Although we believe we are adequately protected against such losses by insurance, a judgment against us under a \u201cdram shop\u201d statute in excess of the liability covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe face potential liability with our gift cards and Play Pass cards under the property laws of some states.\nOur gift cards are used in our venues to purchase food, beverages, merchandise and game credits, and our Play Pass cards are loaded with game credits purchased by our guests. These cards may be considered stored value cards by certain states in accordance with their abandoned and unclaimed property laws. These laws may require us to remit cash amounts equal to all or a designated portion of the unredeemed balance of stored value cards based on certain criteria and the length of time that the cards are inactive or dormant. Our gift cards and Play Pass cards do not expire and do not incur service fees. We recognize income from unredeemed cards when we determine that the likelihood of the cards being redeemed is remote, and we believe remittance pursuant to abandoned and unclaimed property laws is not required.\nThe analysis of the potential application of the abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards and Play Pass cards is complex and involves an analysis of constitutional issues, statutory provisions, case law and factual matters. In the event that one or more states change their existing abandoned and unclaimed property laws or successfully challenges our position on the application of its abandoned and unclaimed property laws or if the estimates that we use in projecting the likelihood of the cards being redeemed prove to be inaccurate, our liabilities for deferred revenue and revenue recognition with respect to unredeemed gift cards and Play Pass cards may materially differ from the amounts reported in our financial statements and our net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by local conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other events.\nCertain regions in which our facilities (including our support center, venues, and warehouses) are located may be subject to adverse local conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other events. Severe weather, such as heavy snowfall, ice, or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in affected regions from traveling to our venues or prevent employees from performing their work in our facilities, which could adversely affect our sales. If severe weather conditions occur during the first quarter of the year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we typically generate our highest sales and profits during the first quarter. Natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may damage our facilities, which may adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nOur business is seasonal, and quarterly results may fluctuate significantly as a result of this seasonality.\nWe have experienced, and in the future could experience, quarterly variations in our consolidated revenues and profitability as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including the timing of school vacations, holidays, and changing weather conditions. We typically generate our highest sales volumes and profitability in the first quarter of each fiscal year. If there is a material decrease in the customer traffic in our venues during the first quarter of the year due to unusually cold or inclement weather or other circumstances outside of our control, our operating results could be materially, adversely affected for that quarter and further, may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year.\nPublic health issues could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nOur business may be impacted by certain public health issues including epidemics, pandemics and the rapid spread of certain illnesses and contagious diseases. To the extent that our customers feel uncomfortable visiting public locations,\nparticularly locations with a large number of children, due to a perceived risk of exposure to a public health issue, we could experience a reduction in customer traffic, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we could incur losses that are not covered by our insurance, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe have procured and maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are typical for a business of our type and size. However, we could experience a loss that either cannot be insured against or is not commercially reasonable to insure. For example, insurance covering liability for violations of wage and hour laws is generally not available. Under certain circumstances, plaintiffs may file certain types of claims that may not be covered by insurance, or by sufficient insurance to cover the entire amount of a judgment. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek punitive damages, which may also not be covered by insurance. Losses such as these, if they occur, could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe may face labor shortages that could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our venues.\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified executives, managers and skilled employees. From time-to-time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor in certain of the communities in which our venues are located. Shortages of skilled labor may make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract, train and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and could delay the planned openings of new venues or adversely impact our existing venues. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates in existing venues or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the United States Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees. Also, although our hiring practices comply with the requirements of federal law in reviewing employees' citizenship or authority to work in the United States, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our venues, thereby negatively impacting our business.\nWe are dependent on the service of certain key executives, and the loss of any of these personnel could harm our business.\nOur success significantly depends on the continued employment and performance of our key executives. We have employment agreements with certain of our key executives. However, we cannot prevent our key executives from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of any of our key executives could harm our business until a suitable replacement is hired, and such replacement may not have equal experience or capabilities. Additionally, economic conditions or concerted overtures by competitors may lead to resignations of significant numbers of members of our operations management team, which may also negatively impact our consolidated financial results in the short term.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent mistakes in our financial statements and financial fraud. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. Any failure to remediate deficiencies noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm or to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the fair value of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks or other proprietary rights, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, Internet domain name registrations and other proprietary rights relating to our operations. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We therefore devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. However, the protective actions that we take may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand, or competitive position, and if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, we may incur significant legal fees.\nThere can be no assurance that third parties will not claim that our trademarks, menu offerings, or advertising claims\ninfringe upon their proprietary rights or constitute unfair competition. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, may result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future, interfere with our international development agreements, lead to delays or cancellation of pre-paid marketing campaigns, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Additionally, we may be subject to infringement claims by purported patent holders that relate to software or systems that are critical to our operations. As a result, any such claim could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to risks in connection with owning and leasing real estate, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nAs an owner or lessee of the land and/or buildings for our Company-operated venues, we are subject to all of the risks generally associated with owning and leasing real estate, including changes in the supply and demand for real estate in general and the supply and demand for the use of the venues. We may be compelled to continue to operate a non-profitable venue due to our obligations under lease agreements, or we may close a non-profitable venue and continue making rental payments with respect to the lease, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, economic instability may inhibit our landlords from securing financing and maintaining good standing in their existing financing arrangements, which could result in their inability to keep existing tenants or attract new tenants, thereby reducing customer traffic to our venues. The lease terms for our leased facilities vary, and some have only a short term remaining. Most - but not all - of our leased facilities have renewal terms. When a lease term expires, the Company may not be able to renew such lease on reasonable economic and commercial terms, or at all. Such failure to renew leases on reasonable economic and commercial terms could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial results.\nWe also may not be able to renew real property leases on favorable terms, or at all, which may require us to close a venue or relocate, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Of the 520 Company-operated Chuck E. Cheese's venues as of December 31, 2017, 511 are leased. All of the 42 Company-operated Peter Piper Pizza venues as of December 31, 2017 are leased premises. The leases typically provide for a base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the revenue generated by the venues on the leased premises once certain thresholds are met. A decision not to renew a lease for a venue could be based on a number of factors, including an assessment of the area in which the venue is located. We may choose not to renew, or may not be able to renew, certain of such existing leases if the capital investment then required to maintain the venues at the leased locations is not justified by the return on the required investment. If we are not able to renew the leases at rents that allow such venues to remain profitable as their terms expire, the number of such venues may decrease, resulting in lower revenue from operations, or we may relocate a venue, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed rental payments account for a significant portion of our cash operating expenses, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nPayments under our operating leases (excluding rental payments on our sale leaseback properties) account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. For example, total rental payments, including additional rental payments based on sales at some of our venues, under operating leases were approximately $93.2 million, or 10.5% of our Total revenues, in fiscal 2017. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we were a party to operating leases requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately $179.9 million through the next two years and approximately $752.5 million thereafter. We expect that we will lease any new venues we open under operating leases. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under the CEC revolving credit facility or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be successful in integrating the operations of companies we acquire, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have engaged in acquisition activity in the past and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions, such as investments in other entities. Strategic transactions, such as the Peter Piper Pizza acquisition completed in October 2014, involve risks, including those associated with integrating operations or maintaining operations as separate (as applicable); financial reporting; disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies; the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; unknown risks; and the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies or companies in which we may make strategic investments. We may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions. Strategic transactions may be expensive and time consuming, and may strain our resources. Strategic transactions may not be accretive and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, write-offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets.\nWe are involved in litigation relating to the Merger Agreement that could divert management's attention and harm our business.\nAs described in Part 1, Item 3 of this report, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d following the January 16, 2014 announcement that we had entered into a merger agreement (the \u2018\u2018Merger Agreement\u2019\u2019), pursuant to which an entity controlled by Apollo Global Management, LLC (\u201cApollo\u201d) and its subsidiaries merged with and into CEC Entertainment Inc., with CEC Entertainment Inc. surviving the merger (the \u2018\u2018Merger\u2019\u2019), four putative class actions were filed by 29 shareholders in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas, on behalf of our purported stockholders, against us, our directors, Apollo, Queso Holdings Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d) and Merger Sub, in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. These actions were consolidated into one action in March 2014. On July 21, 2015, a consolidated class action petition was filed as the operative consolidated complaint, asserting claims against CEC and its former directors, adding The Goldman Sachs Group (\u2018\u2018Goldman Sachs\u2019\u2019) as a defendant, and removing all Apollo entities as defendants (\u2018\u2018Consolidated Class Action Petition\u2019\u2019). The Consolidated Class Action Petition alleges that our directors breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders in connection with their consideration and approval of the Merger Agreement by, among other things, conducting a deficient sales process, agreeing to an inadequate tender price, agreeing to certain provisions in the Merger Agreement, and filing materially deficient disclosures regarding the transaction. The Consolidated Class Action Petition also alleges that two members of our board who also served as our senior managers had material conflicts of interest and that Goldman Sachs aided and abetted the board\u2019s breaches as a result of various conflicts of interest facing the bank. The Consolidated Class Action Petition seeks, among other things, to recover damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On March 23, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing on the defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Petition and on March 1, 2017, the Special Master appointed by the Court issued a report recommending to the Court that the Consolidated Class Action Petition be dismissed in its entirety. On March 17, 2017, Plaintiffs filed objections to the Special Master\u2019s report and recommendation with the Kansas court and separately filed a motion with the Special Master to amend the complaint as to Goldman Sachs, but not objecting to the dismissal of CEC or its former directors. On November 20, 2017, the Special Master filed a Supplemental Report recommending to the Court that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to amend be denied; if the District Court accepts the Special Master\u2019s supplemental recommendations, the case will be dismissed in its entirety. Both remaining parties (Plaintiffs and Goldman Sachs) filed objections to the Supplemental Report on December 22, 2017, and the parties filed responses to these objections on February 16, 2018. The District Court has not yet set this case for trial. Although CEC Entertainment and its former directors are no longer defendants in the lawsuit, we assumed the defense of the Consolidated Shareholder Litigation on behalf of CEC\u2019s named former directors and Goldman Sachs pursuant to existing indemnity agreements, and continuing to fund Goldman Sach\u2019s defense of this action is expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or to fund our operations, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy, and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nWe are a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2017, we had $986.5 million face value of outstanding indebtedness (excluding capital lease and sale leaseback obligations), in addition to $140.1 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility at that date. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we made total debt service payments of $59.8 million.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our\nability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets; limit our ability to repurchase shares and pay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture and the agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nmake us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nimpact our rent expense on leased space, which could be significant;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new technologies, or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\ncause us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest.\nIn addition, our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks described above could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.\nOur ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things, (a) our future financial and operating performance (including the realization of any cost savings described herein), which will be affected by prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and (b) our future ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the credit agreement governing such facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under our revolving credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on our debt. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the senior notes (as defined in \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Financing\u201d). These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Apollo and its affiliates have no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default, and holders of our senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their loans, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.", "PERMNO": 75432, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "9614B"}
