Shareholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including \u201cPart II-Item 7.-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in \u201cPart II-Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d If any of the following risks occur, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue and future prospects could be seriously harmed. As a result, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. Some statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements in the following risk factors section, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cPart II-Item 7.-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and will likely continue to adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, and the ultimate impact on the business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. While the scope, duration, and full effects of COVID-19 are evolving, remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest prices, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Company is subject to many risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the risk of operational failures due to changes in the Company\u2019s normal business practices necessitated by the pandemic and related governmental and non-governmental actions (including temporarily closing branches and offices, remote workings, and the temporary or permanent loss of key employees and management due to illness);\n\u25cf credit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by the Company\u2019s borrowers as a result of the pandemic and related governmental actions (including risks related to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, under the CARES Act and related credit risks resulting from PPP lending due to forbearance or failure of customers to qualify for loan forgiveness);\n\u25cf collateral for loans, such as real estate, may continue to decline in value, which could cause credit losses to increase;\n\u25cf increased demands on capital and liquidity;\n\u25cf the risk that the Company\u2019s net interest income, lending activities, deposits, swap activities, and profitability may be negatively affected by volatility of interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from the pandemic; and\n\u25cf cybersecurity and information security risks as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely.\nAs noted in \u201cItem 7.-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Information Regarding COVID-19 Impact and Uncertain Economic Outlook-Legislative and Regulatory Developments,\u201d the Federal Reserve has taken various actions and the U.S. government has enacted several fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The ultimate success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the effects of COVID-19 continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified above and elsewhere in this \u201cItem 1A.-Risk Factors\u201d could be exacerbated. While the Company does not yet know the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, operations or the global economy as a whole, the effects could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital levels. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in this \u201cItem 1A.-Risk Factors\u201d should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Business and Operations\nThe Company\u2019s business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of its markets and on the banking industry in general.\nThe Company\u2019s business is concentrated in the Houston and Beaumont, Texas markets and it entered the Dallas, Texas market in 2019. The Company\u2019s success depends, to a significant extent, upon the economic activity and conditions in its markets. Adverse economic conditions that impact the Company\u2019s markets could reduce its growth rate, the ability of customers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying loans, the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits and generally impact its business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Due to the Company\u2019s geographic concentration, it may be less able than other larger regional or national financial institutions to diversify the Company\u2019s credit risks.\nA national economic downturn or deterioration of conditions in the Company\u2019s market, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the sustained declines in oil and gas prices, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s borrowers and cause losses\nTable\nbeyond those that are provided for in its ACL due to increases in loan delinquencies, nonperforming assets, foreclosures, loan charge-offs and decreases in demand for its products and services, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity position and decrease the value of the collateral. Increased economic uncertainty and increased unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of the spread of COVID-19 may also result in borrowers seeking sources of liquidity, withdrawing deposits and drawing down credit commitments at rates greater than previously expected. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by individuals, businesses, government agencies and others in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may aggravate the impact of the risk factors discussed herein on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately measure and limit its credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. The Company\u2019s risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of its loans within specific industries and credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk and credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. Failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe Company maintains an ACL that represents management\u2019s judgment of expected losses and risks of losses inherent in its loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the ACL is inherently highly subjective and requires significant estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risks, future trends and forecasts, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate management assumptions, deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification or deterioration of additional problem loans, acquisition of problem loans, significant changes in forecasted periods and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase its ACL.\nIn addition, regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examinations, review the Company\u2019s methodology for calculating and the adequacy of its ACL and may direct the Company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the ACL, the Company may need additional provisions for credit losses to restore the adequacy of its ACL.\nThe amount of nonperforming and classified assets may increase significantly, resulting in additional losses and costs and expenses.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and assets acquired through foreclosure. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management\u2019s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations when they become due. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management, which may materially and adversely impact their ability to perform their other responsibilities. While the Company seeks to reduce problem assets through loan workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition and any increase in the amount of nonperforming or classified assets could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, including through increased capital requirements from regulators.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to endure adverse business developments, which may impair its borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans.\nThe Company focuses its business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the collateral securing such loans generally includes real property and general business assets, which may decline in value more rapidly than anticipated, exposing the Company to increased credit risk.\nTable\nThe Company\u2019s primary markets in Houston, Beaumont and Dallas have experienced limitations on commercial activity since the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, many businesses, particularly those in the Company\u2019s primary markets, were subject to shutdowns at the onset of the pandemic and may become subject to additional shutdowns and restrictions in light of the periodic increases of COVID-19 cases in Texas. These challenging market conditions in which borrowers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets, resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose the Company to credit losses and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of a small group of people and the health, death, disability or resignation of one or more of the key management, the inefficiency caused by the current remote working arrangement or the limited availability to work due to health concerns in response to COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on borrower\u2019s businesses and their ability to repay their loans.\nThe Company participates in the small business loan program under the CARES Act, which may further expose it to credit losses from borrowers under such programs.\nAmong other components, the CARES Act provides for payment forbearance on mortgages or loans to borrowers experiencing a hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank has offered deferral and forbearance plans and has participated in the PPP by making loans to small businesses consistent with the CARES Act that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. Various governmental programs such as the PPP are complex and the Company\u2019s participation may lead to additional litigation and governmental, regulatory and third-party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to its reputation. In addition, participation in the PPP as a lender may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations depending on the timing and amount of forgiveness, if any, to which borrowers will be entitled and the Company is subject to the risk of PPP fraud cases.\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from loans in its loan portfolio with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $2.1 billion, or 70.2%, of the Company\u2019s gross loans were loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. Real estate values in many Texas markets have experienced periods of fluctuation and can fluctuate significantly in a short period. Adverse developments affecting real estate values and the liquidity could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, cause it to increase the ACL, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without additional losses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.3 billion, or 44.3%, of the Company\u2019s gross loans were nonresidential real estate loans (commercial real estate loans and multi-family residential loans). These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s nonresidential real estate loans included $334.8 million of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which are generally less dependent upon income generated directly from the property, but still carry risks from the successful operation of the underlying business or adverse economic conditions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s nonresidential real estate loans included $635.6 million of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Nonresidential real estate loans expose a lender to greater credit risk because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to fluctuations of the value of the collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $522.7 million, or 17.8%, of the Company\u2019s loans were construction and development loans, which typically are secured by a project under construction. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and construction and development lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, it may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, incur taxes, maintenance and compliance costs for a foreclosed property and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period.\nTable\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, the Company generally requires an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time of appraisal. These estimates may not accurately describe the value of the real property collateral and the Company may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when it forecloses on and sells the relevant property.\nIf the Company forecloses on a loan with real estate assets as collateral, it will own the underlying real estate, subjecting it to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership. The amount that may be realized after a default is dependent upon factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, general or local economic conditions, environmental cleanup liability, assessments, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties, zoning laws, governmental and regulatory rules and natural disasters.\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from loans in its loan portfolio collateralized by general business assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, commercial and industrial loans were $743.0 million, or 25.3%, of the Company\u2019s gross loans. Commercial and industrial loans are generally collateralized by general business assets, including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and most are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Commercial and industrial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis and repayment is subject to the ongoing business operations risks of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than the Company anticipates, thus exposing it to increased credit risk.\nThe Company\u2019s largest loan and deposit relationships currently make up significant percentages of the loan portfolio and deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s 15 largest loan relationships, including related entities, totaled $494.4 million, or 16.8%, of its gross loans. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of large loan relationships is that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, the Company could be at serious risk of material losses. The ACL may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings and capital. Even if the loans are collateralized, a large increase in classified assets could harm the Company\u2019s reputation with regulators and inhibit its ability to execute its business plan.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s 15 largest depositors, including related entities, totaled $550.8 million, or 16.7%, of total deposits. Several of the Company\u2019s large depositors have business, family, or other relationships with each other, which creates a risk that any one customer\u2019s withdrawal of their deposits could lead to a loss of other deposits from customers within the relationship. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of the Company\u2019s largest depositors or by the related customer groups could force the Company to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for its business and withdrawal demands, which may be more expensive and less stable.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of the services of its executive management team and other key employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in large part on the performance of its executive management team and other key personnel, as well as on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for qualified employees is intense and the process of locating qualified key personnel may be lengthy and expensive. If any of the executive management team contract COVID-19, the Company may lose their services for an extended period of time, which would likely have a negative impact on its business and operations.\nA significant percentage of the Company\u2019s key employees and executive leaders live and work in Houston and Beaumont, Texas. This concentration of its personnel, technology, and facilities increases the Company\u2019s risk of business disruptions if the COVID-19 pandemic (or a significant outbreak of another contagious disease) continues to impact the Houston, Beaumont or Dallas metropolitan areas negatively. The Houston market in particular experienced a dramatic rise in COVID-19 cases during a portion of the latter half of 2020. As a result, some of the Company\u2019s employees and management contracted COVID-19. If the Company continues to experience cases of COVID-19 among the employees or such cases become widespread at the Company, it will place more pressure on the remaining employees to perform all functions across the organization while maintaining their health. Although certain remedial measures have been taken,\nTable\nincluding quarantine, temporary branch closure, remote working, and shift working, increased COVID-19 diagnoses may require the Company to take additional remediation measures and could impair its ability to conduct business. The Company may not be successful in retaining its key employees or finding adequate replacements for lost personnel.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income, business, financial condition and results of operations. Many factors outside the Company\u2019s control impact interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and macroeconomic conditions. A majority of banking assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, the Company\u2019s earnings are significantly dependent on its net interest income and are subject to \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities that may negatively impact earnings. Interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for borrowers, which increase the potential for default and delayed payment, and reduces demand for collateral securing the loan. Further, loans in nonaccrual status require continued funding costs, but result in decreased interest income. Interest rate increases may also reduce the demand for loans and increase competition for deposits. Declining interest rates can increase loan prepayments and long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely impact earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. If short-term interest rates remain at low levels for a prolonged period and longer-term interest rates fall, the Company could experience net interest margin compression as interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Changes in interest rates can also impact the value of loans, securities and other assets.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The Company requires sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. The Company relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans and securities to ensure that it has adequate liquidity to fund operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, loan repayments, sales of the Company\u2019s securities, sales of loans and other sources could have a negative impact liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s most important source of funds is deposits, which have historically been stable sources of funds. However, deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to factors that may be outside of the Company\u2019s control, including increasing competitive pressure from other financial services firms for consumer or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes. As a result, there could be significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits, increasing funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income.\nThe Company has unfunded commitments to extend credit, which are formal agreements to lend funds to customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the contracts. Unfunded credit commitments are not reflected on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet and are generally not drawn upon. Borrowing needs of customers may exceed the Company\u2019s expectations, especially during a challenging economic environment where clients are more dependent on credit commitments. Increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s access to funding sources, such as through its line of credit, capital markets offerings, borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank, or from other third-parties, in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect the Company directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nThe Company is dependent on the use of data and modeling in its decision-making.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank decision-making and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in the Company\u2019s operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis and the identification of possible violations of AML regulations are all examples\nTable\nof areas which are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While the Company is not currently subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act stress testing and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submissions, it anticipates that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future.\nThe Company anticipates data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements can be employed more widely and in differing applications. While the Company believes these quantitative techniques and approaches improve decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact its decision-making ability or if the Company became subject to regulatory stress testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. Further, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its ACL, assess the value of financial instruments, goodwill and other intangibles for potential credit losses or impairment depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models, judgments, assumptions and estimates that impact the amounts reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting policies the Company considers to be the most significant accounting policies and methods requiring judgments, assumptions and estimates are discussed further in \u201cPart II-Item 7.-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets may become impaired.\nThe Company reviews goodwill, other intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of these assets might be impaired. While the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to these assets, future evaluations may result in findings of impairment and related write-downs.\nPotential credit losses on securities held in the Company\u2019s portfolio.\nThe Company invests in securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledge requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. Factors beyond the Company\u2019s control can significantly and adversely influence the fair value of securities in its portfolio. For example, fixed rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or issuers, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an expected credit loss which would require the Company to record an ACL and related provision which would impact earnings. The process for determining whether securities are impaired requiring an ACL usually requires subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Although the Company has not recorded an ACL related to its securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020, changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, among other factors, may cause it to record an ACL in future periods.\nThe Company is subject to risk arising from failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. In the past, significant deficiencies have been identified in the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of financial reporting. The Company\u2019s actions to maintain effective controls and remedy any weakness or deficiency may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of its financial statements, which in turn could harm its business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, impair access to the capital markets, cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline and subject it to increased regulatory scrutiny and/or penalties, and higher risk of shareholder litigation.\nTable\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time the FASB or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. Such changes may result in the Company\u2019s financial statements being subject to new accounting and reporting standards or change existing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how new or existing standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how it records and reports the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company may be required to apply a new standard, a revision to an existing standard or change the application of a standard in such a way that financial statements for periods previously reported are revised.\nPotential repurchase and indemnity requests for loans sold to correspondent banks.\nThe Company originates residential mortgage loans for sale to correspondent banks who may resell such mortgages to government-sponsored enterprises, such as Federal National Mortgage Loan Association, or Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporate, or Freddie Mac, and other investors. As a part of this process, the Company makes various representations and warranties to the purchasers that are tied to the underwriting standards under which the investors agreed to purchase the loan. If a representation or warranty proves to be untrue, the Company could be required to repurchase one or more of the mortgage loans or indemnify the investor. Repurchase and indemnity obligations tend to increase during weak economic times, as investors seek to pass on the risks associated with mortgage loan delinquencies to the originator of the mortgage. Although the Company did not repurchase any residential mortgage loans sold to correspondent banks in 2020, if it is forced to repurchase mortgage loans in the future that it previously sold to investors, or indemnify those investors, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy, which includes acquisitions and de novo branching, includes a number of risks.\nThe Company intends to pursue acquisition opportunities that it believes complement its activities and may enhance profitability and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company\u2019s acquisition activities could be material to its business and involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf competition from other banking organizations and other acquirers;\n\u25cf market pricing for desirable acquisitions resulting in lower than traditional returns;\n\u25cf the time and expense associated with identifying, evaluating, and negotiating acquisitions, including diversion of management time from the operation of the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u25cf using inaccurate estimates and judgments with respect to the health or value of acquisition targets;\n\u25cf failure to achieve expected revenues, earnings, savings or synergies from an acquisition;\n\u25cf unknown or contingent target liabilities, including compliance and regulatory issues;\n\u25cf the time and expense required of integration of target customers and data;\n\u25cf loss of key employees and customers;\n\u25cf reputational issues if the target\u2019s management does not align with the Company\u2019s culture and values;\n\u25cf risks of impairment to goodwill; and\n\u25cf regulatory delays.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes evaluating strategic opportunities to grow through de novo branching which carries with it certain potential risks, including: significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking locations; and difficulties successfully integrating and promoting the Company\u2019s corporate culture among other challenges. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with the Company\u2019s growth through de novo branching could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Economy and the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophes.\nTable\nThe Company operates banking locations throughout the Houston and Beaumont areas, which are susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms, other adverse weather conditions, pandemics and other catastrophes. In addition, man-made events such as acts of terror, governmental responses to acts of terror, malfunctions of the electronic grid and other infrastructure breakdowns (such as the grid failures in February 2021 resulting from unusually cold weather for the region) could adversely affect economic conditions in its markets. These adverse weather and catastrophic events can disrupt operations, cause widespread and extensive property damage, force the relocation of residents and significantly disrupt economic activity in the region, significantly depress the local economies in which the Company operates and adversely affect its customers. If the economies in the Company\u2019s markets experience an overall decline because of a catastrophic event, demand for loans and its other products and services could decline. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on the Company\u2019s loan portfolios may increase substantially after events such as hurricanes, as uninsured property losses, interruptions of its customers\u2019 operations or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the Company\u2019s loans could be materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event.\nThe Company be adversely impacted by sustained low oil prices, volatility in oil prices and downturns in the energy industry.\nThe economy in Texas is dependent on the energy industry. Sustained low oil prices or the failure of oil prices to rise in the future and the resulting downturns or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business could have a negative impact on the Texas economy and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Since 2014, the oil and gas industry has experienced a sustained downturn due to low oil and gas prices. The unprecedented sharp decline in crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2020 negatively impacted the oil and gas industry and the overall Texas economy. Prolonged weak oil and gas prices may cause further worsening conditions of energy companies, oilfield services companies, related businesses and overall economic activities in the Company\u2019s primary markets and could lead to increased credit stress in its loan portfolio, increased losses and weaker demand for lending. More significantly for the Company, sustained low oil prices or general uncertainty resulting from energy price volatility could have other adverse impacts such as significant job losses in industries tied to energy, lower spending habits, lower borrowing needs, negative impact on construction and real estate related to energy and a number of other potential impacts that are difficult to isolate or quantify. Oil and gas pricing and the resultant economic conditions may not recover meaningfully in the near term.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from financial institutions located both within and beyond the Company\u2019s principal markets. The Company competes with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, nonbank financial services companies and other financial institutions operating within or near the areas it serves. Certain large banks headquartered outside of the Company\u2019s markets and large community banking institutions target the same customers it does. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and mobile devices and for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. The banking industry has experienced rapid changes in technology and, as a result, the Company\u2019s future success may depend in part on its ability to address customer needs by using technology. Customer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Increased lending activity of competing banks can also lead to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for high-quality credits. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in its markets and it may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability.\nMany of the Company\u2019s nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive because of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than the Company may be able to accommodate.\nTable\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Third-Parties and Technology\nThe Company depends on information technology and telecommunications systems, including third-party service providers.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems including with third-party servicers and financial intermediaries. The Company relies on third-parties for certain services, including, but not limited to, core systems processing, website hosting, internet services, monitoring its network and other processing services. The Company\u2019s business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, an information security or cybersecurity breach involving any of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, or the termination or change in terms of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s primary federal regulator, the OCC, has issued guidance outlining the expectations for third-party service provider oversight and monitoring by financial institutions. Any failure on the Company\u2019s part to adequately oversee the actions of its third-party service providers could result in regulatory actions against the Bank.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by fraudulent activity, breaches of its information security and cybersecurity attacks.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against it, its clients, or third-parties with whom the Company interacts and that may result in financial losses or increased costs to it or its clients, disclosure or misuse of confidential information belonging to the Company or personal or confidential information belonging to its clients, misappropriation of assets, litigation, or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company\u2019s industry has seen increases in electronic fraudulent activity, hacking, security breaches, sophisticated social engineering and cyber-attacks, including within the commercial banking sector, as cyber-criminals have been targeting commercial bank and brokerage accounts on an increasing basis.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of its infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third-parties with whom it interacts or on whom it relies. The Company\u2019s business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third-parties. In addition, to access the Company\u2019s network, products and services, its customers and other third-parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the Company\u2019s network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. All of these factors increase the Company\u2019s risks related to cyber-threats and electronic disruptions.\nIn addition to well-known risks related to fraudulent activity, which take many forms, such as check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, wire fraud, and other dishonest acts, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents have become a material risk to the Company and in the financial services industry in general. These threats may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to data processing or data storage systems used by the Company or by its clients, electronic identity theft, \u201cphishing\u201d, account takeover, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. These electronic viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things, obtain unauthorized access to\nTable\nconfidential information belonging to the Company or its clients and customers; manipulate or destroy data; disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on a financial institution\u2019s systems; or steal money.\nUnfortunately, it is not always possible to anticipate, detect or recognize these threats to the Company\u2019s systems, or to implement effective preventative measures against all breaches, whether those breaches are malicious or accidental. Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years and have been difficult to detect before they occur because of the following, among other reasons:\n\u25cf the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions;\n\u25cf these threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are in the Company\u2019s control, including among others, human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third-parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to its property or assets, natural disasters or severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts;\n\u25cf the techniques used in cyber-attacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or until well after the breach has occurred;\n\u25cf the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage;\n\u25cf the vulnerability of systems to third-parties seeking to gain access to such systems either directly or by using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems; and\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s frequent transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third-parties, including its vendors and regulators, and possible weaknesses that go undetected in the Company\u2019s data systems notwithstanding the testing it conducts of those systems.\nWhile the Company invests in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and it conduct periodic tests of its security systems and processes, the Company may not succeed in anticipating or adequately protecting against or preventing all security breaches and cyber-attacks from occurring. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.\nAs is the case with non-electronic fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at the Company or third-parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on the Company\u2019s systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage its reputation with customers and third-parties with whom it does business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could expose the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact its results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nDuring 2018, the Company experienced a security incident involving the possible unauthorized access of certain personal information in the possession of the Bank. The Company takes the privacy of personal information seriously and took steps to address the incident promptly after it was discovered, including initiating an internal investigation into the incident and working with an independent forensic investigation firm to assist in the investigation of and response to the incident. The Company also reported the incident to law enforcement authorities. Based on the report of the independent forensic investigation firm, the Company believes that a phishing incident occurred where certain emails and attachments from two employee email accounts may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. The Company believes that these email accounts contained certain personal information for approximately 7,800 individuals. Although the Company\u2019s investigation did not find any evidence that the incident involved any unauthorized access to or use of any of the Bank\u2019s internal computer systems or network, and it believes that the access was limited to information that was contained in the email accounts of the two employees, the Company may become subject to claims in the future for purportedly fraudulent transactions or other matters arising out of the breach of information stored in the affected email accounts. Additionally, the incident may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation if it becomes subject to claims in the future, and\nTable\nreputational harm arising out of such claims or litigation may cause its customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to safeguard their information.\nRisks Related to Legal, Reputational and Compliance Matters\nThe Company is subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that it maintains and in those maintained by third-parties with whom the Company contracts to provide data services. The Company also maintains important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about its employees and information relating to its operations. The Company is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third-parties). For example, the Company\u2019s business is subject to the GLB Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on its ability to share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third-parties; (ii) requires that it to provide certain disclosures to customers about information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by the Company with nonaffiliated third-parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that it develops, implements and maintains a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on its size and complexity, the nature and scope of the Company\u2019s activities and the sensitivity of customer information it processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. There are various state and federal data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that the Company\u2019s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase its costs.\nFurthermore, the Company may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third-parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with it, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third-parties), the Company could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause it to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce its revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject the Company to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely impact its operations and financial condition.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by employee errors and customer or employee fraud.\nAs a financial institution, employee errors and employee or customer misconduct could cause financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Misconduct by employees could include hiding unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information, each of which can be damaging to the Company. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct and the precautions taken to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect it from material losses associated with these risks, including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. If these internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by its borrowers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to approve loans or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties, the Company relies on information furnished by, or on behalf of, borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements,\nTable\ncredit reports, auditors reports, other financial information and representations as to accuracy and completeness of that information. Any intentional or negligent misrepresentation, if undetected prior to loan funding, may significantly lower the value of the loan, and the Company may be subject to regulatory action. The Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with these misrepresentations. The Company\u2019s controls and processes may not detect misrepresented information. Any such misrepresented information could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the real properties it owns and the foreclosure on real estate assets securing the loan portfolio.\nThe Company may purchase real estate in connection with its acquisition and expansion efforts, or it may foreclose on and take title to real estate or otherwise be deemed to be in control of property that serves as collateral on loans. The Company could be subject to environmental investigation, remediation, or liabilities with respect to those properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities or based on third-party common law claims could be substantial and may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by those properties. The Company may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties and may not be able to resell the affected properties either before or after completion of any removal or abatement procedures.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property in addition to other litigation in the ordinary course of business.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company also uses trademarks and logos for marketing purposes, and third-parties may allege that the Company\u2019s marketing, processes or systems may infringe their intellectual property rights. Competitors of the Company\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, may from time to time claim to hold intellectual property sold to the Company. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation that can be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to operations and distracting to management.\nIn addition to litigation relating to intellectual property, the Company is regularly involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. While the Company believes that these litigation matters should not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects, it may be unable to successfully defend or resolve any current or future litigation matters.\nNegative public opinion regarding the Company or its failure to maintain the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s reputation in the communities served could adversely impact business.\nAs a community bank, the Company\u2019s reputation within the communities served is critical to its success. The Company believes it has set itself apart from competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with its customers and by being an active member of the communities it serves. The Company strives to enhance its reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Company\u2019s core values of being an integral part of the communities it serves and delivering superior service to customers. If the Company\u2019s reputation is negatively affected by the actions of its employees or otherwise, the Company may be less successful in attracting new talent and customers or may lose existing customers. Further, negative public opinion can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action and could delay and impede efforts to implement its expansion strategy.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of the Company\u2019s Industry\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect the Company\u2019s shareholders, but rather, they are intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the overall financial stability of the U.S.\nTable\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional operating costs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the Company to restrictions on business activities, enforcement actions and fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, regulatory capital levels and the price of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cPart I-Item 1.-Business-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company could be adversely impacted if it fails to comply with any supervisory actions.\nAs part of the bank regulatory process, the OCC and the Federal Reserve periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If one of these federal banking agencies were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of the Company\u2019s operations have become unsatisfactory, or that the Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital levels, to restrict growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Company, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. Becoming subject to such regulatory actions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank entered into an Agreement with the OCC which subjects it to restrictions and will require it to designate a significant amount of resources to comply with the terms of the Agreement.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Bank and the OCC entered into an Agreement with regard to BSA/AML compliance matters. The Agreement generally requires that the Bank enhance its policies and procedures to comply with BSA/AML laws and regulations. See \u201cPart II Item 7.-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview\u201d for additional information regarding the Agreement. The Bank is working to promptly address the requirements of the Agreement. However, if the Bank does not successfully address the OCC\u2019s concerns in the Agreement or fully comply with its provisions, the Bank could be subject to further regulatory scrutiny, civil monetary penalties, further regulatory sanctions and/or other enforcement actions. The Company or the Bank may also become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions by other regulatory agencies. Any of those events could have a material adverse impact on future operations, financial condition, growth, or other aspects of the Company\u2019s business.\nWhile subject to the Agreement, the Company expects that management and the Board of Directors will be required to focus considerable time and attention on taking corrective actions to comply with its terms. The Bank has hired and may continue to hire third-party consultants and advisors to assist in complying with the Agreement, which is expected to increase non-interest expense and reduce earnings.\nMany of the Company\u2019s new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals and failure to obtain them may restrict growth.\nThe Company intends to complement and expand its business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses and de novo branching. Generally, the Company must receive federal regulatory approval before it can acquire a depository institution or related business insured by the FDIC, or before it can open a new branch. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on acceptable terms or at all. The Company may also be required to sell banking locations as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which may not be acceptable or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to AML statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and frequently coordinates enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration\nTable\nand the IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by OFAC. To comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, the Company has dedicated significant resources to its AML program. If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures, systems and practices are deemed deficient, it could be subject to liability, including fines, regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the inability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching, and criminal sanctions.\nThe Bank is the subject of an investigation by FinCEN regarding the Bank\u2019s compliance with the BSA and AML laws and regulations.\nThe Bank is the subject of an investigation by FinCEN and the Bank is cooperating with this investigation. The Bank has incurred material fees and expenses regarding with this matter and may continue to incur material fees and expenses regarding this matter at least through the completion of FinCEN\u2019s investigation. Additionally, the Bank could be subject to additional liability or restrictions on its operations in the event the investigation results in some type of finding of a deficiency in its program that results in an enforcement action or civil money penalty which could have a material adverse impact on the Company and its operations.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rulemaking powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. The CFPB has indicated that it may propose new rules on overdrafts and other consumer financial products or services, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations if any such rules limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide such financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to the Company\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties can also challenge the Bank\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of and transactions with such persons and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA through the Bank and the Company\u2019s agents and employees, which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage. The Company is also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it may operate. The Company has implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Failure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.\nTable\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict the Company\u2019s ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase the risk of liability with respect to such loans.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is the Company\u2019s policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to the Company\u2019s lending and loan investment activities. They increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent it from making certain loans and cause it to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that the Company makes.\nFederal, state and local regulations and/or the licensing of loan servicing, collections and the Company\u2019s sales of loans to third-parties may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance and subject it to litigation.\nThe Company services some of its loans and loan servicing is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities, including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, the Company may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements, which may further adversely affect it. In addition, if the Company were subject to regulatory investigation or regulatory action regarding its loan modification and foreclosure practices, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the Company sells loans to third-parties and as part of these sales, the Company makes various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in a requirement that the Company repurchases the loans, or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties. These aspects of the Company\u2019s business or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could possibly lead to civil and criminal liability, loss of licensure, damage the Company\u2019s reputation in the industry, fines, penalties and litigation, including class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement actions.\nPotential limitations on incentive compensation contained in proposed federal agency rulemaking may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain its highest performing employees.\nIn April 2011 and May 2016, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more in assets, such as the Bank. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the way the Company structures compensation for its executives and other employees. Depending on the nature and application of the final rules, the Company may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees. If this were to occur, relationships that the Company has established with its clients may be impaired and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely impact earnings and results of operations.\nThe Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. In 2010, the FDIC increased the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s target reserve ratio to 2.0% of insured deposits following the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s elimination of the 1.5% cap on the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s reserve ratio and the FDIC is required to put in place a restoration plan should the Deposit Insurance Fund fall below its 1.35% minimum reserve ratio. If the Deposit Insurance Fund falls below its minimum reserve ratio or fails to meet its funding requirements, special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. Further, if there are additional financial institution failures that affect the Deposit Insurance Fund, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums.\nTable\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine that was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, the Company could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at a time when resources are limited and the Company may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital to make the required capital injection. Any loan by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank is subordinate in right with payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing by a bank holding company to make a capital injection to a subsidiary bank often becomes more difficult and expensive relative to other corporate borrowings.\nThe Company could be adversely impacted by monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant impact on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although the Company cannot determine the effects of such policies on it, such policies could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts its operations and capital requirements.\nThe OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Obligations.\u201d Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like the Bank is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations.\nThe focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance provides that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. While the Company believes it has implemented policies and procedures with respect to its commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require the Company to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to the Company or that may result in a curtailment of its commercial real estate lending and/or the requirement that the Bank maintains higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s loan originations and profitability.\nTable\nThe Company has made loans to and accepted deposits from related parties.\nFrom time to time, the Bank has made loans to and accepted deposits from certain of the Company\u2019s directors and officers and the directors and officers of the Bank in compliance with applicable regulations and the Company\u2019s written policies. The Company\u2019s business relationships with related parties are highly regulated. In particular, the Company\u2019s ability to do business with related parties is limited with respect to, among other things, extensions of credit described in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation O and covered transactions described in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W. If the Company fails to comply with any of these regulations, it could be subject to enforcement and other legal actions by the Federal Reserve.\nRisks Related to Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may affect the market price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u25cf changes in economic or business conditions;\n\u25cf the effects of and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u25cf publication of research reports about the Company, its competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of the Company\u2019s financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf additional or anticipated sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities by the Company or its existing shareholders;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf perceptions in the marketplace regarding competitors or the Company, including the perception that investment in Texas is unattractive or less attractive during periods of low oil prices;\n\u25cf significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u25cf other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting the Company\u2019s operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u25cf other news, announcements or disclosures (whether by the Company or others) related to the Company, its competitors, its primary markets or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and especially the market for financial institution stocks have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and could make it difficult to sell shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nFuture sales and issuances of the Company\u2019s capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of its shareholders.\nThe Company may issue additional securities in the future and from time to time, including as consideration in future acquisitions or under compensation or incentive plan. Future sales and issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock or rights to purchase its common stock could result in substantial dilution to the Company\u2019s existing shareholders. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company may grant registration rights covering shares of its common stock or other securities in connection with acquisitions and investments.\nTable\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, the Company\u2019s legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses are substantial. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB and the Nasdaq, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, compliance with these reporting requirements and other SEC and Nasdaq rules has made certain operating activities more time-consuming. Further, the Company\u2019s reporting burden will increase when it no longer qualifies for the scaled disclosure allowed as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. When these exemptions cease to apply, the Company will likely incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward compliance.\nThe Company\u2019s management and Board of Directors have significant control over its business.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately 25.8% of its outstanding common stock as a group at December 31, 2020. Consequently, the Company\u2019s management and Board of Directors may be able to significantly affect its affairs and policies, including the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all the Company\u2019s assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. This influence may also have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or changes in management or limiting the ability of the Company\u2019s other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of the Company. The interests of these insiders could conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other shareholders.\nThe holders of the Company\u2019s debt obligations have priority over its common stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up and with respect to the payment of interest.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, its common stock would rank below all claims of debt holders against the Company. The Company\u2019s debt obligations are senior to its shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on its debt obligations before any dividends can be paid on its common stock. In the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the Company\u2019s debt obligations must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. To the extent that the Company issues additional debt obligations, they will be of equal rank with, or senior to, the Company\u2019s existing debt obligations and senior to shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of formation authorizes it to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by the Company\u2019s shareholders. The Company\u2019s preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of its common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, discourage bids for its common stock at a premium over the market price and materially adversely impact the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is dependent upon the Bank for cash flow and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted.\nThe Company\u2019s primary tangible asset is the stock of the Bank. As such, the Company depends upon the Bank for cash distributions that it uses to pay its operating expenses, satisfy obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. Federal statutes, regulations and policies restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to the Company. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, the OCC can restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends by supervisory action. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, it will not be able to pay dividends on its common stock.\nTable\nThe Company\u2019s dividend policy may change without notice and its future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nAlthough the Company has historically paid dividends to its shareholders, the Company has no obligation to continue doing so and may change its dividend policy at any time without notice to holders of its common stock. Holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, consistent with the Company\u2019s strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, the Company has made and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to holders of its common stock.\nThe Company is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve requiring that it inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to the Company\u2019s capital structure, including interest on its debt obligations. If required payments on the Company\u2019s debt obligations are not made or are deferred, or dividends on any preferred stock the Company may issue are not paid, the Company will be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to declare or pay dividends is also subject to the terms of its loan agreement, which prohibits it from declaring or paying dividends upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. See \u201cPart II-Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 11.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal and state law to which it is subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of formation and its bylaws (each as amended and restated) may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control or a replacement of the Company\u2019s incumbent Board of Directors or management. The Company\u2019s governing documents include provisions that:\n\u25cf empower its Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are to be set by the Board of Directors;\n\u25cf establish a classified Board of Directors, with directors of each class serving a three-year term upon completion of a phase-in period;\n\u25cf provide that directors may only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority shareholder vote;\n\u25cf eliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors;\n\u25cf permit its Board of Directors to alter, amend or repeal the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws or to adopt new bylaws;\n\u25cf calling a special shareholders\u2019 meeting requires the request of holders of at least 50.0% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u25cf prohibit shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent, thereby requiring virtually all actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders;\n\u25cf require shareholders that wish to bring business before annual or special meetings of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders, to provide timely notice of their intent in writing; and\n\u25cf enable the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to increase, between annual meetings, the number of persons serving as directors and to fill the vacancies created as a result of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors.\nIn addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control. Furthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the CIBC Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located in Jefferson County, Texas, the county in which Beaumont is located, will be the exclusive forum for: (i) any actual or purported derivative action or\nTable\nproceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty by any of the Company\u2019s directors or officers; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or its directors or officers arising pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code, the Company\u2019s certificate of formation, or its bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or its officers or directors that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Shareholders of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of the Company\u2019s bylaws related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in the Company\u2019s bylaws may limit its shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with it. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 17108, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBTX"}
