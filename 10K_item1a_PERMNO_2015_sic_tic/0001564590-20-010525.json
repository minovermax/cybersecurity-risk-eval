{"cik": "1667161", "company": "Randolph Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nBefore deciding to invest in us or deciding to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this report and the matters addressed in the section of this report titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward- Looking Statements\u201d. The events discussed below could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have incurred operating losses in several recent years and our ability to generate future profitability is uncertain.\nWe achieved net income of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, but experienced losses in four of the five previous fiscal years. Our ability to achieve future profitability depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan, our ability to achieve improved operating efficiency, our ability to manage nonperforming and classified assets, general economic conditions, competition with other financial institutions, changes to the interest rate environment that may reduce our profit margins or impair our business strategy, adverse changes in the securities markets, changes in laws or government regulations, changes in consumer spending, borrowing, or saving, and changes in accounting policies, as well as other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business, we are unable to predict the extent of our future profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2019, one- to four-family residential loans comprised $244.7 million, or 51.8%, of our total loan portfolio, and home equity loans and lines of credit comprised $41.7 million, or 8.8%, of our total loan portfolio. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending, whether owner occupied or non-owner occupied, is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nResidential loans with combined higher loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. Further, a significant amount of our home equity loans and lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our home equity loans.\nWe are focused on growing our loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate, and these risks will increase if we succeed in our plan to increase these types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, $170.0 million, or 36.0%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate. Also, many of our borrowers or related groups of borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose\nus to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022\ncommercial real estate loans - repayment is generally dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service;\n\u2022\ncommercial and industrial loans - repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business; and\n\u2022\nconstruction loans - repayment is dependent upon completion, the ability of the owner to make payments during the construction process, and the subsequent ability of the owner to either sell the completed project or obtain permanent financing on the completed project.\nIf loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would in turn adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, if we foreclose on the collateral, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for one- to four-family real estate loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs.\nOur loan portfolio contains a significant portion of loans that are unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 totaled $472.0 million an increase of $136.9 million, or 41%, since December 31, 2016. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these loans added to our portfolio during this three-year period because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses totaled $4.3 million, which represented 0.90% of total loans and 131.4% of our non-performing loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which could materially affect our operating results.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to income, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe building of market share through de novo branching and expansion of our lending capacity could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nWe intend to continue to build market share through de novo branching and the expansion of our lending capacity. There can be considerable costs involved in opening branches and expanding our lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in the opening of any of our new branches. Finally, our business expansion may not be successful after establishment.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our cost of funding.\nWe compete with banks and other financial intermediaries for deposits. Funding costs may increase if we lose deposits and are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if customers shift their deposits into higher cost products or if we need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and profitability.\nOur wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace retail deposits at maturity and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to retail deposits and funds from the repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we may become more dependent on these sources, which include FHLBB advances, brokered deposits, listing service deposits, and proceeds from the sale of loans. At December 31, 2019, we had $44.4 million of FHLBB advances outstanding with an additional $136.5 million available borrowing capacity, and $7.5 million of available borrowing capacity under a line of credit with a correspondent bank. Brokered deposits as of December 31, 2019 totaled $90.9 million. If we were no longer considered to be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d as defined by applicable federal regulations, it would materially restrict our ability to acquire and retain brokered deposits in the future and could reduce the maximum borrowing limits we currently have available through the FHLBB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Additionally, adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nLike all banking institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates as well as the relative changes in both short and long-term rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control.\nWhile we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates may still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nOur mortgage banking revenue and the value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nWe sell in the secondary market and to other financial institutions longer term, conforming and non-conforming fixed-rate and, to a lesser extent, ARMs that we originate, which provides a significant portion of our noninterest income in the form of gains on the sale of mortgage loans. We also earn revenue from fees we receive for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a sizeable portfolio of MSRs which represent the right to service a mortgage loan - collect principal, interest, and escrow amounts - for a fee. We acquire MSRs when we keep the servicing rights after we sell the loans we have originated.\nChanges in interest rates may impact our mortgage banking revenues, which could negatively impact our noninterest income. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing loan origination volume and the related amount of gains on the sales of loans. Under the same conditions, net revenue from our mortgage servicing activities can increase due to slower prepayments, which reduces our amortization expense for mortgage servicing rights. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of our mortgage servicing rights usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a \u201cnatural hedge,\u201d the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the mortgage servicing rights relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the mortgage servicing rights value caused by the lower rates.\nIn addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expenses associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits (including commissions), occupancy, equipment and data processing expense, and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nWhile there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by property located in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy, such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic event, or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our assets. Our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses could hurt our operating results.\nOur non-interest expenses totaled $36.0 million and $31.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We continue to analyze our expenses and seek to achieve efficiencies where available. Although we strive to generate increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, our efficiency ratio remains high. Our efficiency ratio totaled 91.0% and 104.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Failure to control or maintain our expenses could hurt future profitability.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could adversely affect us.\nAll securities in our portfolio are classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, a decline in the fair value of our securities could cause a material decline in our reported equity and/or operating results. At least quarterly, and more frequently when warranted by economic or market conditions, management evaluates all securities classified as available-for-sale with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, or OTTI. For impaired debt securities that are intended to be sold, or more likely than not will be required to be sold, the full amount of market decline is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Non-credit related OTTI for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. A decline in the market value of our securities portfolio could adversely affect our earnings.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We also face competition from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from nondepository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, and specialty finance companies. Competition in mortgage banking comes from traditional mortgage competitors within our market area as well as larger, nationally active mortgage originators. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nOur banking business is highly regulated, and laws and regulations, or changes in them, could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and Envision Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible non-banking activities, the level of reserves against deposits, and restrictions on dividend payments. The FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks have the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we and Envision Bank may conduct business and obtain financing.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to capital and liquidity standards that require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nWe are subject to capital requirements that require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially higher levels of capital as a percentage of their assets, with a greater emphasis on common equity as opposed to other components of capital. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding customers. Our electronic communications and information systems infrastructure, as well as the systems infrastructures of the vendors we use to meet our data processing and communication needs, could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. No matter how well designed or implemented our controls are, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and we may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches in a timely manner. A failure or circumvention of our security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, significant regulatory costs, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of available insurance coverage, if any, and would adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could negatively impact customer confidence, damaging our reputation and undermining our ability to attract and keep customers.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, or pandemics could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as internet connections, network access, and core application processing. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour future dividend practices;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility.\nOur stock-based benefit plans have increased our costs, which will reduce our profitability.\nOur employee stock ownership plan purchased 8.0% of the total shares of common stock sold in the initial public offering, with funds borrowed from Randolph Bancorp, Inc. We record annual employee stock ownership plan expense in an amount equal to the fair value of shares of common stock committed to be released to employees. If shares of common stock appreciate in value over time, compensation expense relating to the employee stock ownership plan will increase.\nWe also adopted a stock-based benefit plan, which allows us to award participants restricted shares of our common stock (at no cost to them) and/or grant options to purchase shares of our common stock. The issuance of restricted stock or granting stock options result in increased compensation expense to us, which reduces profitability.\nOur articles of organization and bylaws and certain regulations may prevent or make more difficult to pursue certain transactions, including a sale or merger of Randolph Bancorp, Inc.\nProvisions of our articles of organization and bylaws, state corporate law, and federal and state banking regulations may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. Consequently, our shareholders may not have the opportunity to participate in such a transaction and the trading price of our common stock may not rise to the level of other institutions that are more vulnerable to hostile takeovers.\nProvisions of our articles of organization, bylaws, and state corporate law that may make it more difficult and expensive to pursue a takeover attempt that the board of directors opposes include:\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations and changes to some provisions of the articles of organization and bylaws;\n\u2022\na limitation on the right to vote shares;\n\u2022\nthe election of directors to staggered terms of three years;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting by shareholders in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions restricting the calling of special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nprovisions regarding the timing and content of shareholder proposals and nominations.\nIn addition, state corporate law and federal banking regulations place limitations on the acquisition of certain percentages of our common stock and impose restrictions on these significant shareholders.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk, and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategic plan.\nOur growth is essential to improving our profitability, and we expect to continue to incur expenses related to the implementation of our strategic plan, including hiring initiatives and the opening of new branches to increase deposit growth. We may\nnot be able to successfully implement our strategic plan, or do so in the timeframe that we expect, and therefore may not be able to increase profitability in the timeframe that we expect or at all, and could experience a decrease in profitability.\nThe successful implementation of our strategic plan will require, among other things that we attract new customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area or adjacent markets. In addition, our ability to successfully grow will depend on several factors, including continued favorable market conditions, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area, our ability to attract and retain experienced lenders, and our ability to maintain high asset quality as we increase our loan portfolio. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, growth opportunities may not be available and we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy. Further, it will take time to implement our business strategy, especially for our lenders to originate enough loans and for our branch network to attract enough favorably priced deposits to generate the revenue needed to offset the associated expenses. Our strategic plan, even if successfully implemented, may not ultimately produce positive results.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure or other similar proceedings, properties securing loans we have originated that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered at these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties as a result of their condition. These events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use significant assumptions and estimates in our financial models to determine the fair value of certain assets, including MSRs, origination commitments and loans held for sale. If our assumptions or estimates are incorrect, that may have a negative impact on the fair value of such assets and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe use internal and third-party financial models that utilize market data to value certain assets, including mortgage servicing rights when they are initially acquired and on a quarterly basis thereafter. The methodology used to estimate these values is complex and uses asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates and liquidity dates. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated, or if delinquency or default levels are higher than anticipated, we may be required to write down the value of certain assets, which could adversely affect our earnings. Prepayment speeds are significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates and are therefore difficult to predict. During periods of declining interest rates, prepayment speeds increase resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs. In addition, there can be no assurance that, even if our models are correct, these assets could be sold for our carrying value should we choose or be forced to sell them in the open market.\nIf we are required to repurchase mortgage loans that we have previously sold, it could negatively affect our earnings.\nIn connection with selling residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, our agreements with investors contain standard representations and warranties and early payment default clauses that could require us to repurchase mortgage loans sold to these investors or reimburse the investors for losses incurred on loans in the event of borrower default within a defined period after origination or, in the event of breaches of contractual representations or warranties made at the time of sale that are not remedied within a defined period after we receive notice of such breaches, or refund the profit received from the sale of a loan to an investor if the borrower pays off the loan within a defined period after origination. If we are required to repurchase mortgage loans or provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our costs and thereby affect our future earnings.\nHedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe employ techniques that limit, or \u201chedge,\u201d the adverse effects of rising interest rates on our loans held for sale and commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified rates under certain terms and conditions. Our hedging activity varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates and other changing market conditions. These techniques may include purchasing or selling futures contracts, or entering into commitments with investors to sell loans. There are, however, no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from loss. Moreover, hedging activities could result in losses if the event against which we hedge does not occur. Additionally, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things:\n\u2022\nAvailable interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n\u2022\nThe duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;\n\u2022\nThe party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay;\n\u2022\nThe credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;\n\u2022\nThe value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value; and/or\n\u2022\nDownward adjustments, or \u201cmark-to-market losses,\u201d would reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees.\nOur success depends on the talent and ability of our employees. Competition for the best people can be intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain the employees that we depend upon for success, or the employees that we do hire may be restricted for a period of time in the activities that they may perform for us as a result of agreements with their previous employers. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key employees could jeopardize our relationships with our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts and relationships, causing an adverse impact on our business, due to the loss of employee skills, institutional knowledge, and client relationships. Frequently, we compete in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to comprehensive regulation, including with respect to the structure of incentive compensation. Our inability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees could adversely impact our business.\nDifficulty integrating new executives could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are currently undergoing significant changes in executive leadership. Changes to strategic or operating goals, which can occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods, including adding new personnel, could be difficult as new executives gain an understanding of our business and strategy. Difficulty integrating new executives or the loss of key individuals could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and could have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including funding sources, adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which will stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or may have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which of those instruments may remain outstanding or be renegotiated if LIBOR ceases to exist. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our funding costs or net interest margins, as well as any floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate and, ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by our regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations, which may result in our need to raise additional capital to support continued growth. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC or the Federal Reserve, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nIf we raise capital through the issuance of additional of common stock or other securities, it would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholder and may dilute the per share value of our common stock. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or \u201cFASB,\u201d the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nOf the newly issued guidance, the most significant to us is the FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as \u201cCECL,\u201d which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. It also modifies the impairment model for debt securities available for sale and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The impact of this update will be dependent on the portfolio composition, credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption. We are required to implement the CECL methodology by 2023.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, which may result in a decrease or increase to our deferred tax asset. Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties, or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and if we elect to comply only with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions.\nAs an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering in 2016. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering; (2) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (4) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million at the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.", "PERMNO": 16183, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "RNDB"}
