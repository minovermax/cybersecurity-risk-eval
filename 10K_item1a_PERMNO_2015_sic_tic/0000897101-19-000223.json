If any of the risks events actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of future operations could be materially adversely affected. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations, which could adversely affect us.\nFactors that affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to, the volume and timing of orders received, changes in the global economy and financial markets, changes in the mix of products sold, market acceptance of our products and our customer\u2019s products, competitive pricing pressures, global currency valuations, the availability of electronic components that we purchase from suppliers, our ability to meet demand, our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis, the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors, changing customer requirements, delays in new product qualifications, the timing and extent of research and development expenses and regulatory changes and/or delays. These factors have caused and may continue to cause us to experience fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly and/or annual basis. These fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of customers for a majority of our revenues. In fiscal year 2018, our largest customer accounted for approximately 56 percent of our net revenue and our five largest customers accounted for approximately 70 percent of our net revenue. A significant decrease or delay in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of customers to develop and sell products that incorporate our products. No assurance can be given that our major customers will not experience financial, technical, regulatory or other difficulties or delays that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our customers.\nSome of our customers purchase our products on credit, which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2018, we had accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, of $11,479, which represented approximately 12 percent of our shareholders\u2019 equity as of that date. As of that date, two customers accounted for a combined total of approximately 52 percent of our accounts receivable. Our financial condition and profitability may be harmed if one or more of our customers are unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due.\nWe recently acquired Hearing Help Express and we may explore other acquisitions that complement or expand our business. Acquisitions pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn 2016, we acquired 20% of the equity of Hearing Help Express and, in late 2017, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 80% equity interest. Hearing Help Express represents a new and exciting business opportunity; however, we do not have any prior experience in the direct-to-end-consumer mail order hearing aid business, and we may not be able to successfully integrate or profitably operate this business, which may result in our not realizing the value paid for the acquisition. We recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $4,177 in connection with the acquisition, and if we are not able to realize the value paid, it could lead to impairment of the assets acquired, for which we would need to recognize an expense charge. Our success will be largely influenced by management\u2019s ability to hire and retain skilled direct-to-end-consumer personnel and determine the proper customer base and marketing channels to achieve our planned profitability levels.\nWe may explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for various reasons, including a failure to secure financing.\nThe Hearing Help Express acquisition, and any other transactions that we are able to identify and complete, involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; unanticipated liabilities and litigation; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Future acquisitions also may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt.\nDespite improvement in economic conditions, downturns in the domestic economic environment could cause a severe disruption in our operations.\nOur business has been negatively impacted by the domestic economic environment in past years. If the economy does not continue to improve, or worsens, there could be several severely negative implications to our business that may exacerbate many of the risk factors we identified including, but not limited to, the following:\nLiquidity:\n\u25cf\nThe domestic economic environment, including credit markets, could worsen and reduce liquidity and this could have a negative impact on financial institutions and the country\u2019s financial system, which could, in turn, have a negative impact on the business of our customers and on our business.\n\u25cf\nInvestments held by the Company are subject to market conditions which could decline in value and reduce liquidity.\n\u25cf\nInterest rates have begun to rise and are expected to continue to rise, which could disrupt domestic and world markets and could adversely affect the economy as a whole and our liquidity, costs of borrowing and results of operations.\nDemand:\n\u25cf\nAny downturn in the economy or a return to recession could result in lower sales to our customers. Additionally, our customers may not have access to sufficient cash or short-term credit to obtain our products or services.\nPrices:\n\u25cf\nIn the event of a downturn, certain markets could experience deflation, which would negatively impact our average prices and reduce our margins.\nHealth care policy changes, including U.S. health care reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act. The legislation imposed significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales beginning in January 2013. Under the legislation, the total cost to the medical device industry was estimated to be approximately $30 billion over ten years. Congress suspended the excise tax for 2016 and 2017. Further legislation was adopted in January 2018 to continue the suspension for two years. If the excise tax is not repealed or further suspended, the tax would go back into effect on December 31, 2019. If re-imposed, this tax could have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows either directly, through taxes on us, or indirectly through others in our value chain being subject to the tax. Although the direct impact of the excise tax is expected to be immaterial on us, if facts or circumstances change in our business relationships, we could be subject to customer pricing pressures or required to pay additional taxes under the rules.\nOther elements of this legislation, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nThe Trump Administration and members of Congress have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict if the Affordable Care Act will be modified, repealed or replaced or the effect that any such actions will have on our business.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop new products that are inexpensive to manufacture, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to achieve our historical profit margins due to advancements in technology. The ability to continue our profit margins is dependent upon our ability to stay competitive by developing products that are technologically advanced and inexpensive to manufacture.\nOur need for continued investment in research and development may increase expenses and reduce our profitability.\nOur industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development. If we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become less attractive to existing and potential customers and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of the need to maintain or increase spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development, our operating results could be materially harmed if our research and development efforts fail to result in new products or if revenues fall below expectations. In addition, as a result of our commitment to invest in research and development, management believes that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in the future.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business and if we are unable to be competitive, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSeveral of our competitors have been able to offer more standardized and less technologically advanced hearing and professional audio communication products at lower prices. Price competition has had an adverse effect on our sales and margins. Many of our competitors are larger than us and have greater research and development resources, marketing and financial resources, manufacturing capability and customer support organizations than we have. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our technical capabilities or compete successfully with our existing and future competitors.\nMerger and acquisition activity in our hearing health market has resulted in a smaller customer base. Reliance on fewer customers may have an adverse effect on us.\nSeveral of our customers in the hearing health market have undergone mergers or acquisitions, resulting in a smaller customer base with larger customers. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with the reduced customer base, it may adversely affect our operating profits and revenue.\nOur failure, or the failure of our customers, to obtain required governmental approvals and maintain regulatory compliance for regulated products would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from those products.\nThe markets in which we and our customers operate are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, and surveillance procedures for our medical devices and those of our customers.\nThe process of obtaining marketing clearance or approvals from the FDA for new products and new applications for existing products can be time-consuming and expensive, and there is no assurance that such clearance/approvals will be granted, or that the FDA review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products. Some of our products in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre-market approval process with the FDA. The FDA has the authority to control the indicated uses of a device. Products can also be withdrawn from the market due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems. The FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, with possible retroactive effect, will not adversely affect us.\nThe registration system for our medical devices in the EU requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards. Manufacturing facilities and processes under which our hearing aid devices are produced, are inspected and audited by various certifying bodies. These audits verify our compliance with applicable requirements and standards. Further, the FDA, various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect our facilities to determine whether we are in compliance with various regulations relating to quality systems, such as manufacturing practices, validation, testing, quality control, product labeling and product surveillance. A determination that we are in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures, suspensions or shutdown of production and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions, depending on the nature of the violation.\nFurther, to the extent that any of our customers to whom we supply products become subject to regulatory actions or delays, our sales to those customers could be reduced, delayed or suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings.\nImplementation of our growth strategy may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase revenues.\nOur growth strategy includes developing new products and entering new markets, as well as identifying and integrating acquisitions. Our ability to compete in new markets will depend upon a number of factors including, among others:\n\u25cf\nour ability to create demand for products in new markets;\n\u25cf\nour ability to manage growth effectively;\n\u25cf\nour ability to strengthen our sales and marketing presence;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nour ability to respond to changes in our customers\u2019 businesses by updating existing products and introducing, in a timely fashion, new products which meet the needs of our customers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to fund growth;\n\u25cf\nthe quality of our new products; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to respond rapidly to technological change.\nThe failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may face competition in these new markets from various companies that may have substantially greater research and development resources, marketing and financial resources, manufacturing capability and customer support organizations.\nWe have foreign operations in Singapore, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Germany, and various factors relating to our international operations could affect our results of operations.\nIn 2018, we operated in Singapore, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Germany. Approximately 17 percent of our revenues were derived from our facilities in these countries in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 14 percent of our long-lived assets are located in these countries. Political or economic instability in these countries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to disruption of production or diminished revenues in these countries. Our future revenues, costs of operations and profit results could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country to country, changes in a country\u2019s political condition, trade protection measures, licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues. Unanticipated currency fluctuations in the British pound, euro, Singapore dollar and other currencies could lead to lower reported consolidated revenues due to the translation of this currency into U.S. dollars when we consolidate our revenues and results from operations.\nEvents in Europe could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those countries.\nFollowing a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the European Union (often referred to as Brexit), which is currently scheduled to take place on March 29, 2019. In 2018, we derived 17 percent of our revenues from sales outside the U.S., including 7 percent from Europe. The consequences of Brexit, together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of Brexit or the exit of the United Kingdom without an agreement, could introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. While we are not experiencing any immediate adverse impact on our financial condition as a result of Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, including the British pound and the euro, or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition. All of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the European Union.\nThe recent debt crisis in certain European countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, could result in product delays and inventory issues; risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense. Also, the effect of the debt crisis in certain European countries could have an adverse effect on the capital markets generally, specifically impacting our ability and the ability of our customers to finance our and their respective businesses on acceptable terms, if at all, the availability of materials and supplies and demand for our products.\nWe are subject to tax legislation in numerous countries; changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a global corporation with a presence in the United States, Singapore, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Germany. As such, we are subject to tax laws, regulations and policies of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in other country jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, including the recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Act\u201d), as well as other factors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates in 2019 and thereafter and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments, tax credits or incentives will not be adversely affected by these or other initiatives.\nIf we fail to meet our financial and other covenants under our loan agreements with our lenders, absent a waiver, we will be in default of the loan agreements and our lenders can take actions that would adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our loan agreements. In the event we are unable to comply with these covenants during future periods, it is uncertain whether our lenders will grant waivers for our non-compliance. If there is an event of default by us under our loan agreements, our lenders have the option to, among other things, accelerate any and all of our obligations under the loan agreements which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our senior management team and if we are not able to retain them, it could have a materially adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team, including Mark S. Gorder, our President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors. We depend on the services of Mr. Gorder and the other members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our business strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships. Certain members of our management team are approaching retirement and the Company must locate and employ suitable replacements from within or without the Company. We do not maintain key-man life insurance for any members of our senior management team.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, insurance, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems and user training and education), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, loss of customers, litigation with customers and other parties, loss of trade secrets and other proprietary business data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nOur future success depends in part on the continued service of our engineering and technical personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel.\nThere is intense competition for qualified personnel in our markets. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future. The failure to retain and recruit key technical personnel could cause additional expense, potentially reduce the efficiency of our operations and could harm our business.\nWe and/or our customers may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors.\nOur ability to compete effectively against other companies in our markets depends, in part, on our ability and the ability of our customers to protect our and their current and future proprietary technology under patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws. We cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the proprietary rights we own or license. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in attempting to protect our proprietary rights.\nAlso, despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our and our customers\u2019 products, develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we or our customers regard as proprietary. We and our customers may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our or our customers\u2019 technology.\nIf we become subject to material intellectual property infringement claims, we could incur significant expenses and could be prevented from selling specific products.\nWe may become subject to material claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future. We cannot assure that, if made, these claims will not be successful. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid, and could distract management from other business. Any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products.\nEnvironmental liability and compliance obligations may affect our operations and results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations as well as internal programs and policies governing:\n\u25cf\nair emissions;\n\u25cf\nwastewater discharges;\n\u25cf\nthe storage, use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and chemicals; and\n\u25cf\nemployee health and safety.\nIf violations of environmental laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties, fines and remedial actions. Our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws, as well as any required material modifications arising from new regulations that may be enacted in the future. We may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or former businesses or businesses we acquire. In addition, it is possible that we may be held liable for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities.\nWe are subject to numerous asbestos-related lawsuits, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are a defendant along with a number of other parties in lawsuits alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos-related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants. These lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which we sold in March 2005. Due to the non-informative nature of the complaints, we do not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against us. Certain insurance carriers have informed us that the primary policies for the period August 1, 1970-1978 have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide defense and insurance coverage under those policies. However, we have other primary and excess insurance policies that we believe afford coverage for later years. Some of these other primary insurers have accepted defense and insurance coverage for these suits, and some of them have either ignored our tender of defense of these cases, or have denied coverage, or have accepted the tenders but asserted a reservation of rights and/or advised us that they need to investigate further. Because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos, we believe we will have funds available for defense and insurance coverage under the non-exhausted primary and excess insurance policies. However, unlike the older policies, the more recent policies have deductible amounts for defense and settlements costs that we will be required to pay; accordingly, we expect that our litigation costs will increase in the future as the older policies are exhausted. Further, many of the policies covering later years (approximately 1984 and thereafter) have exclusions for any asbestos products or operations, and thus do not provide insurance coverage for asbestos-related lawsuits. If our insurance policies do not cover the costs and any awards for the asbestos-related lawsuits, we will have to use our cash or obtain additional financing to pay the asbestos-related obligations and settlement costs. There is no assurance that we will have the cash or be able to obtain additional financings on favorable terms to pay asbestos related obligations or settlements should they occur. The ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty. In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos lawsuits, there is no guarantee that these lawsuits will not materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and there has been limited trading volume in our stock, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile, and there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. For example, our stock traded between a low sale price of $16.70 and a high sale price of $76.80 in 2018. The common stock market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of fluctuations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u25cf\nregulatory or other delays affecting our or our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and announcement of sales or acquisitions of assets by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nadverse or unfavorable publicity about our products, technologies or us;\n\u25cf\nthe commencement of material litigation, or an unfavorable verdict, against us;\n\u25cf\nterrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nsales of common stock by us or our shareholders.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Such volatility has affected many companies irrespective of, or disproportionately to, the operating performance of these companies. These broad fluctuations and limited trading volume may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and your ability to sell our common stock.\nMost of our outstanding shares are available for resale in the public market without restriction. The sale of a large number of these shares could adversely affect the share price and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or make acquisitions for common stock.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders.\nWe are a Pennsylvania corporation. Anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold. For example, our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. In addition, our bylaws provide for a classified board, with each board member serving a staggered three-year term. Directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, referred to as Section 404, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, reports of our management and our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting. While we have reported no \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we cannot guarantee that we will not have material weaknesses in the future. Compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming. If in the future we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner, or if we determine that we have a material weakness, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, any failure to establish an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential investors and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 41574, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "IIN"}
