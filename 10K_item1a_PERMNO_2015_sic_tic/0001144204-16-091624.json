{"cik": "1600422", "company": "Superior Drilling Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn this Item 1A. the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d used herein refer to Superior Drilling Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated or as the context so requires.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAn extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry has reduced and will continue to significantly reduce our revenue and income and resulted in an impairment of our other assets.\nOur business depends upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including:\n\u00b7 worldwide economic activity;\n\u00b7 the level of exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7 interest rates and the cost of capital;\n\u00b7 environmental regulation;\n\u00b7 federal, state and foreign policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas;\n\u00b7 the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u00b7 governmental regulations regarding future oil and gas exploration and production;\n\u00b7 the cost of exploring and producing oil and gas;\n\u00b7 the cost of developing alternative energy sources;\n\u00b7 the availability, expiration date and price of leases;\n\u00b7 the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u00b7 the success of drilling for oil and gas in unconventional resource plays such as shale formations;\n\u00b7 technological advances;\n\u00b7 weather conditions.\nWe expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of our products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. These risks are greater during periods of low or declining commodity prices. Continued significant or prolonged declines in hydrocarbon prices have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure to generate sufficient revenue to make payments on the Hard Rock Note could result in our loss of the patents securing the Hard Rock Note.\nUnder the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note, we are required to make the following payments (plus accrued interest): $500,000 on January 15, 2016, $1,500,000 on July 15, 2016, $500,000 on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017, $500,000 on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2019. The Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note matures and is fully payable on July 15, 2019.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note is secured by all of the patents, patents pending, other patent rights, and the Drill-n-Ream trademark purchased by HR from the holder of the Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note (the \u201cDrill-n-Ream Collateral\u201d). If we do not have the funds necessary to make the future payments under the Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note and fail to make any payments as required thereunder, the holder of the Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note could conduct a foreclosure sale on the Drill-n-Ream Collateral in order to apply the proceeds thereof toward repayment of the Second Amended and Restated Hard Rock Note and all foreclosure costs, and Superior Drilling Solutions, LLC would be liable for any shortfall or receive any excess from the sales proceeds. The failure to retain the Drill-n-Ream Collateral could cause a significant loss of our investment and might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation, as well as our ability to grow our drill string tool business.\nDue to reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows, coupled with pending payments required on our indebtedness, we may be unable to maintain adequate liquidity and our ability to make payments in respect of our indebtedness could be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of approximately $0.2 million. During 2015 our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and repayment of debt. Given the current environment of the oil and gas industry, we anticipate revenues will decline in 2016, however, due to the addition of our Strider tool, this new revenue will offset some of the anticipated decrease. The Strider revenue will come from the efforts of our sales team along with additional sales from the Baker Hughes agreement to provide the Strider tools to their customers.\nOur operational and financial strategies include lowering our operating costs and capital spending to match revenue trends, managing our working capital and manage our debt to enhance liquidity. On March 8, 2016, the Company entered into a financing agreement with Federal National Commercial Credit (\u201cFNCC\u201d) in the amount $3 million. The financing agreement includes a $500,000 term loan collateralized with previously unencumbered manufacturing equipment and the remaining balance is a $2.5 million accounts receivable revolving credit facility allowing up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable.\nDuring 2016, we plan on using the cash flows from operations to fund debt repayment. Also, we will renegotiate the Hard Rock Note, to postpone debt repayment dates and/or convert debt to common shares. To further conserve cash, we have implemented a salary for stock options program for senior management and board of directors during the 1st quarter of 2016. Based on our current expectations, our additional financing agreement with FNCC and assuming we are successful in restructuring the Hard Rock Note, we believe that our available cash will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and debt payments.\nIn the event we are not successful, the Company will be looking to the public equity and debt market as a way to obtain further financing during the next 12 months, including our Founders selling their common shares. As part of this plan, on March 24, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement in preparation of looking to the public market if the need arises. With this plan in place we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations, existing cash, and cash equivalents and renegotiation of certain debt obligations will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nAlthough as a public company we have access to the public markets for capital raises, we cannot provide any assurances that financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain or decrease our general and administrative expenses depending on market demands for our products and services; (ii) fund certain obligations as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in our business or our industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe are required to make payments on the Hard Rock note of $2 million each year over the next three years and $4 million for 2019. In addition, we are required to make monthly payments of $39,317 on our note with American Bank of the North.\nBased on current forecasts we will need to restructure debt obligations, raise additional capital through equity and/or debt financings. As previously noted we are considering several options to address this situation, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful at raising the needed funds.\nOur debt could have important consequences. For example, it could (i) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, (ii) limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, (iii) increase our cost of borrowing, (iv) restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures, (v) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged and (vi) impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur customers\u2019 industries are undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is rapidly consolidating and, as a result, some of our largest customers have consolidated and are using their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers or the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. For example during 2014, Halliburton announced its acquisition of Baker Hughes. Currently Baker Hughes is our sole customer for our bit refurbishment business and we do not know how this acquisition may impact our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our level of sales to a customer that has consolidated or replace that revenue with increased business activity with other customers. As a result, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, such as Baker Hughes, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on price, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling equipment.\nSeveral of our competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours and which have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer time than us. If these competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing competitive products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively. Similarly, consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product and service offerings and financial resources, further intensifying competition.\nOur customer base is concentrated and the loss of, or nonperformance by, one or more of our significant customers could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nWe contract exclusively with Baker Hughes, a multinational organization, for our entire drill bit remanufacturing business, and most of our original equipment drill bit manufacturing business. With our Drill N Ream rental and repair business, we have three large customers that equaled 40% of our total revenue for 2015. It is likely that we will continue to derive a portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer decided not to continue to use our services or significantly reduces its drilling plans, our revenue would decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our customer base. Any increase in the nonpayment of and nonperformance by our counterparties, either as a result of changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur operating history may not be sufficient for investors to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe are a recently formed company with a short operating history. This may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and prospects and to forecast our future operating results. As a result, historical financial data may not give you an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if subsequent acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented or of what our future results of operations are likely to be. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our operations and execute our business strategy.\nThere may be fluctuations in our operating results.\nSignificant annual and quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, our volume of revenues, the timing of new product or service announcements, releases by us and our competitors in the marketplace of new products or services, seasonality and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues achieved by us in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. We believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicators of future performance. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and are based on management\u2019s expectations of future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues.\nWe must continue to develop new technologies, methodologies and products on a timely and cost-effective basis to satisfy the needs of our customers.\nThe drilling industry is driven primarily by cost minimization, and our strategy is aimed at reducing drilling costs through the application of new drill bit assembly and drill string tool technologies. Our continued success will depend on our ability to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs, on a timely and cost-effective basis, by successfully enhancing our current products and processes; developing, producing and marketing new products and processes; and responding to evolving industry standards and other technological changes.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications of our customers or that we will be able to perform the testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in the future, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy their requirements will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet our customer\u2019s demand for services may adversely affect our business. We may encounter resource constraints, competition, or other difficulties that may delay our ability to expand our bit remanufacturing services to the level desired or required by our customer. If our products are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform any required testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, and our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on key personnel who may be difficult to replace.\nOur success is dependent to a significant degree upon the business expertise and continued contributions of our founders and senior management team. In particular, we are dependent upon the efforts and services of our founders, Mr. Troy Meier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Annette Meier, our President, because of their knowledge, experience, skills, and relationships with major clients and other members of our management team, as well as the other members of our executive team. Although we have employment arrangements certain members of senior management, as a practical matter, those agreements will not assure the retention of our employees and we may not be able to enforce all of the provisions in any such employment agreement, including the non-competition provisions. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel in is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Our inability to retain these types of individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe rely on the availability of volume and quality of synthetic diamond cutters for both our remanufactured drill bit business and for our new drill string tool manufacturing business. In addition, we must have a reliable source of steel available for our new manufacturing business which is both of sufficient quality, and available at a cost-effective price. We do not have fixed price contracts or arrangements for all of the raw materials and other supplies that we purchase. Baker Hughes provides the diamond cutters for our remanufacturing business. However, sourcing cost-effective supplies of quality steel in the relatively low volumes that our new tool manufacturing requires can be challenging. However, shortages of, and price increases for, steel and other raw materials and supplies that we use in our business may occur. Future shortages or price fluctuations in synthetic diamond cutters or steel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct either our remanufacturing business or our new drill tools in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.\nOur manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials from third parties. The ability of these third parties to deliver raw materials may be affected by events beyond our control. Any interruption in the supply of raw materials needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation with our customers.\nWe may be exposed to unforeseen risks in our product manufacturing and processes, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe operate our business from our Vernal manufacturing facilities. A natural disaster, extended utility failure or other significant event at our facility could significantly affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. In addition, the equipment and management systems necessary for our operations are subject to wear and tear, break down and obsolescence, which could cause them to perform poorly or fail, resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies and production costs. Significant manufacturing fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and we may suffer financial penalties and a diminution of our commercial reputation and future product orders. Additionally, some of our business may in the future be conducted under fixed price contracts. Fluctuations in our manufacturing process, or inaccurate estimates and assumptions used in pricing our contracts, even if due to factors out of our control, may result in cost overruns which we may be required to absorb. Any shut down of our manufacturing facility, reductions in our manufacturing process or efficiency, or cost overruns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers to sustain or expand our current operations.\nBoth of our remanufacturing and new manufacturing lines of business require personnel with specialized skills and experience. The supply of skilled and experienced personnel may not be sufficient to meet current or expected demand. Any significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity could be diminished, our ability to respond quickly to customer demands or strong market conditions may be inhibited and our growth potential impaired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth strategy successfully, our business, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions and the development and implementation of new product designs and improvements, which presents numerous managerial, administrative, operational and other challenges. Our ability to manage the growth of our operations will depend on our ability to develop systems and services and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and, if so, at prices acceptable to our customers to compete in the industry in which we operate. Our ability to compete effectively will also depend on our ability to continue to obtain patents on our proprietary technology and products. Although we do not consider any single patent to be material to our business as a whole, the inability to protect our future innovations through patents could have a material adverse effect. In addition, our growth will increase our need to attract, develop, motivate, and retain both our management and professional employees. The inability of our management to manage our growth effectively or the inability of our employees to achieve anticipated performance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAcquisitions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring other companies that complement our service offerings or broaden our technical capabilities and geographic presence. From time to time, we evaluate purchases and sales of assets, businesses or other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated realization of savings, creation of efficiencies, offering of new products or services, generation of cash or income or reduction of risk. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions involve numerous risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 any acquisition would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022 the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure;\n\u2022 the use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses;\n\u2022 any disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not divert management resources from the operation of our business; or\n\u2022 any disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur inability to integrate acquisitions successfully could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate Hard Rock or other future acquisitions, we could be impeded from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u2022 unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;\n\u2022 unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u2022 maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u2022 integrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u2022 preserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u2022 coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations.\nEven if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Failing to realize the benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business and financial position that we currently cannot predict.\nUncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact the ability of our customers to finance purchases of our products and services and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders or adversely affect the collectability of our receivables. If the availability of credit to our customers is reduced, they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures, thereby decreasing demand for our products and services, which could have a negative impact on our financial position. Additionally, unsettled conditions could have an impact on our suppliers, causing them to be unable to meet their obligations to us. Although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets in the short term, a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long-term operational and capital needs.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nMaterials and minerals used in our manufacturing process may become subject to laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe diamonds comprising the diamond cutting discs used in our operations are synthetic and manufactured in the United States, South Africa and China. Neither those diamond cutters nor any other minerals used in our operations are currently identified as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, we cannot predict or control if the United States Secretary of State will or will not identify one of the minerals used in our manufacturing process as a conflict mineral. Should the materials used in our manufacturing process be designated as a conflict mineral, we will be required to file Form SD with the SEC and conduct the required diligence to determine the source of the conflict mineral in connection with such disclosure. Any increased costs and expenses associated with this could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will be affected by the use and protection of our proprietary technology. There are limitations to our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology, and thus our right to exclude others from the use of such proprietary technology.\nOur success will be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Although in many cases our products are not protected by any registered intellectual property rights, in other cases we rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology.\nWe currently hold multiple U.S. patents and have multiple pending patent applications for products and processes in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries. Patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents in the applicable country. Patent rights do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent, but merely the right to exclude others from practicing the invention claimed in the patent. It may also be possible for a third party to design around our patents. Furthermore, patent rights have strict territorial limits. Some of our work will be conducted in international waters and may, therefore, not fall within the scope of any country's patent jurisdiction. We may not be able to enforce our patents against infringement occurring in international waters and other \u201cnon-covered\u201d territories. Also, we do not have patents in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business and may relate to obsolete or unusual methods, which would not prevent third parties from entering the same market.\nIn addition, by customarily entering into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers, we attempt to limit access to and distribution of our technology. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (e.g. information in expired issued patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. We cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.\nOur competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property and we may not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future.\nOur businesses and our customers\u2019 businesses are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These environmental laws and regulations affect the products and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our products. For example, our operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations that, among other things, may regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; require acquisition of environmental permits related to our operations; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit operation activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; require compliance with operational and equipment standards; impose testing, reporting and record-keeping requirements; and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could limit our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities. These laws and regulations change frequently, which makes it impossible for us to predict their cost or impact on our future operations. For example, legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences. Also, the EPA has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA has expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and has adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. To date, there has been no significant legislative progress in cap and trade proposals or greenhouse gas emission reductions. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the hydrocarbons that our customers produce. Consequently, such legislation or regulatory programs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. It is too early to determine whether, or in what form, further regulatory action regarding greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted or what specific impact a new regulatory action might have on us or our customers. Generally, the anticipated regulatory actions do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies that are our competitors. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or modified or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us or our customers.\nEnvironmental laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws and regulations provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Any of these laws and regulations could result in claims, fines or expenditures that could be material to results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur failure to implement and comply with our safety program could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nOur safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management, and the implementation of the safety program is a significant issue in our dealings with our clients. Unsafe job sites and office environments have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable, and raise our operating costs. The implementation of our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus, and may be evaluated by certain clients in cases in which safety requirements have been established in our contracts. If we fail to comply with safety regulations or maintain an acceptable level of safety at our facilities we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, or may be held criminally liable. We may incur additional costs to upgrade equipment or conduct additional training, or otherwise incur costs in connection with compliance with safety regulations. Failure to maintain safe operations or achieve certain safety performance metrics could disqualify us from doing business with certain customers, particularly major oil companies.\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent to these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and defects, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids and natural disasters, on land or in deep water or shallow-water environments, can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface water and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. In addition, we provide certain services that could cause, contribute to or be implicated in these events. If our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract or other litigation claims, which could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and gas production, and pollution and other environmental damages. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Further, insurance may not be generally available in the future or, if available, insurance premiums may make such insurance commercially unjustifiable. Moreover, even if we are successful in defending a claim, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nIn addition, the frequency and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our products or services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because we may acquire companies that have not allocated significant resources and management focus to quality, or safety requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process. We may incur liabilities for losses associated with these newly acquired companies before we are able to rehabilitate such companies' quality, safety and environmental programs.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely on our proprietary production management technology which has changed how users connect to our knowledge and other information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct our business. Despite our security and back-up measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, natural disasters and other disruptions or failures. The failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and those of our customers, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, increased overhead costs, loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to prevent or respond to damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur related party transactions with the Meiers and their affiliated entities may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect us.\nWe have entered into, and may, in the future, enter into various transactions and agreements with the Meiers and their affiliated entities. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with the Meiers are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the Meiers or their affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates had a value of less than $75 million at the time of filing of our registration statement. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, including, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering in May 2014. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (a) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue exceed $1.0 billion, (c) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (d) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have elected to adopt new or revised accounting standards at such times as applicable to other non-emerging grown public companies.\nFurthermore, a material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period because of our extended exemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nAs long as we are controlled by the Meiers, the ability of our stockholders to influence the outcome of matters will be limited.\nThe Meiers continue to own 51% of our outstanding common stock and serve on our Board of Directors. As long as they have voting control of our company, SDPI will have the ability to take many stockholder actions, including the election or removal of directors, irrespective of the vote of, and without prior notice to, any other stockholder. As a result, the Meiers will have the ability to influence or control all matters affecting us, including:\n\u00b7 the composition of our board of directors and, through our board of directors, decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u00b7 any determinations with respect to acquisitions of businesses, mergers or other business combinations and change of control transactions;\n\u00b7 our acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u00b7 our capital structure.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell common stock in the future are subject to large fluctuations in response to any of the following:\n\u2022\nlimited trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe prices of natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022\nour involvement in litigation; and\n\u2022\nother events.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future.\nWe have not paid any dividends in the past and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business. In addition, under Utah law no distribution may be made if, after giving it effect: (a) we would be unable to pay our debts as they come due, or (b) our total assets would be less than our total liabilities. We can provide no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022 provisions regulating the ability of our shareholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our shareholders;\n\u2022 limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; and\n\u2022 the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 14636, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "SDPI"}
