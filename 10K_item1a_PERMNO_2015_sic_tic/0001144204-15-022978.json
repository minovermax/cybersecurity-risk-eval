{"cik": "1001601", "company": "MGT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nDiscussion of our business and operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of our securities. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Annual Report (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in commercializing any of the Company\u2019s products or if any of our products are commercialized, that they will be profitable for the Company.\nThe Company generates limited revenue from operations upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. The Company\u2019s prospects must be considered keeping in mind the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in a constantly changing industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nThe Company has identified a number of specific risk areas that may affect our operations and results in the future:\nCompany specific risks\nOur financial results are highly concentrated in the online mobile and gaming business; if we are unable to grow online mobile and gaming revenues and find alternative sources of revenue, our financial results will suffer.\nSoftware, devices and gaming accounted for substantially all of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our success depends upon customers choosing to use, and search advertising partners choosing to advertise, on, our online, mobile and casino gaming products. Decisions by customers and our search advertising partners not to adopt our products at projected rates, or changes in market conditions, may adversely affect the use or distribution of our products. Because of our revenue concentration in the online, mobile and casino gaming business, such shortfalls or changes could have a negative impact on our financial results, or with regard to some of our larger advertising partners specifically, our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity will suffer.\nOur acquisition activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u00b7 inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u00b7 challenges retaining the key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired business; inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;\n\u00b7 an impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs; the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;\n\u00b7 in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u00b7 and liability for activities of the acquired companies before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nBecause acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.\nThe mobile game application business is still developing, and our efforts to develop mobile games may prove unsuccessful, or even if successful, it may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenues from this activity because, among other reasons:\n\u00b7 we may have difficulty optimizing the monetization of our mobile games due to our relatively limited experience creating games that include micro-transaction capabilities, advertising and offers;\n\u00b7 we intend to continue to develop substantially all of our games based upon our own intellectual property, rather than well-known licensed brands, and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our games, particularly since we have had relatively limited success generating significant revenues from games based on our own intellectual property;\n\u00b7 man well-funded public and private companies have released, or plan to release, mobile games, and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenues from them;\n\u00b7 mobile games have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will become or remain or its revenue potential;\n\u00b7 our mobile strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free and that we will subsequently be able to effectively monetize the games; however, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity, ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts, lack of sufficient community features, lack of prominent storefront featuring and the relatively large file size of some of our \u201cthin-client games,\u201d which often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user\u2019s device. Due to the inherent limitations of the most commonly-used smartphone platforms and telecommunications networks, which only allow applications that are less than 50 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier\u2019s wireless network, players must download one of our thick-client games either via a wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) connection, or initially to their computer and then side-load the thick-client game to their device;\n\u00b7 even if our games are widely downloaded, we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games for a variety of reasons, including poor game design or quality, lack of community features, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;\n\u00b7 the billing and provisioning capabilities of some smartphones and tablets are currently not optimized to enable users to purchase games or make in-app purchases, which make it difficult for users of these smartphones and tablets to purchase our games or make in-app purchases and could reduce our addressable market, at least in the short term; and\n\u00b7 the Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors, and the commission might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or name us as a defendant in a future class-action lawsuit.\nIf we do not achieve a sufficient return on our investment with respect to this business model, it will negatively affect our operating results and may require us to make change to our business strategy.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nDeveloping, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews. We compete for promotional and storefront placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners or carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.\nWe compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Zynga, King Digital, Soul & Vibe Interactive, DeNA, Gree, Nexon, and Glu. In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.\nSome of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:\n\u00b7 significantly greater financial resources;\n\u00b7 greater experience with the mobile games business model and more effective game monetization;\n\u00b7 stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;\n\u00b7 stronger strategy which may reach our target audience better than our current strategy;\n\u00b7 greater experience integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users;\n\u00b7 the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n\u00b7 larger installed customer bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;\n\u00b7 more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;\n\u00b7 lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;\n\u00b7 greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise; and\n\u00b7 broader global distribution and presence.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nInflation and future expectations of inflation influence consumer spending on entertainment such as online gaming and gambling.\nAs a result, our profitability and capital levels may be impacted by inflation and inflationary expectations. Additionally, inflation\u2019s impact on our operating expenses may affect profitability to the extent that additional costs are not recoverable through increased cost of consumer acquisition for our portfolio of online, mobile gaming and casino gaming offerings.\nConsumer tastes are continually changing and are often unpredictable, and we compete for consumer discretionary spending against other forms of entertainment; if we fail to develop and publish new mobile games that achieve market acceptance, our sales would suffer.\nOur mobile game business depends on developing and publishing mobile games that consumers will want to download and spend time and money playing. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and continue to update our successful mobile games, and we often must make decisions about these matters well in advance of product release to timely implement them. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games, new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment activities. If our games and related applications do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if our games are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a failure to continue to update them with compelling content or a subsequent shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could cause a decline in our games\u2019 popularity that could materially reduce our revenues and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers, who face a vast array of entertainment choices, including games played on personal computers and consoles, television, movies, sports and the Internet. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment, our business and financial results would be seriously harmed.\nIf we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our games or if our games contains defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to establishing a direct relationship with end users who purchase our products from direct-to-consumer channels and to maintaining our existing relationships with distributors and content licensors, as well as potentially developing new such relationships. Increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic focus of developing games based on our own intellectual property. Our ability to promote our brand and increase recognition of our games depends on our ability to develop high-quality, engaging games. If consumers, digital storefront owners and branded content owners do not perceive our existing games as high-quality or if we introduce new games that are not favorably received by them, then we may not succeed in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our games is costly and involves extensive management time to execute successfully, particularly as we expand our efforts to increase awareness of our brand and games among international consumers. Although we have significantly increased our sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brand or the new games. If we fail to increase and maintain brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenues could be limited, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nIf we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our sales may suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the commercial introduction of new mobile devices with enhanced features, including larger, higher resolution color screens, improved audio quality, and greater processing power, memory, battery life and storage. For example, the introduction of new and more powerful versions of Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad and devices based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, have helped drive the growth of the mobile games market. In addition, consumers generally purchase the majority of content, such as our games, for a new device within a few months of purchasing it. We do not control the timing of these device launches. Some manufacturers give us access to their mobile devices prior to commercial release. If one or more major manufacturers were to stop providing us access to new device models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce games that are compatible with the new device when the device is first commercially released, and we might be unable to make compatible games for a substantial period following the device release. If we do not adequately build into our title plan the demand for games for a particular mobile device or experience game launch delays, we miss the opportunity to sell games when new mobile devices are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new mobile device, our revenues would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.\nWe will need additional capital to continue our operation.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing for advertising, promotion and acquisition of additional products. The Company is constantly looking for new sources of revenue that will help fund our business. There can be no assurances that this will be achieved.\nIf we successfully raise additional funds through the issuance of debt, we will be required to service that debt and are likely to become subject to restrictive covenants and other restrictions contained in the instruments governing that debt, which may limit our operational flexibility. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, then those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of holders of our Common stock, and holders of our Common stock will experience dilution.\nWe cannot be certain that such additional debt or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise funds in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to promote our brand, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unexpected requirements, and we may be required to reduce or limit operations.\nThe effect of the proposed \"Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act.\"\nDuring the 2003 fiscal year, the House Judiciary Committee of the US Government approved HR21 \"Unlawful Internet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act\". This bill creates a new crime of accepting financial instruments, such as credit cards or electronic fund transfers, for debts incurred in illegal internet gambling. The bill enables state and federal Attorneys General to request that injunctions be issued to any party, such as financial institutions and internet service providers, to assist in the prevention or restraint of illegal internet gambling. This bill still needs to be ratified by the Senate before it becomes passed as law. We may be affected by this bill and therefore the Company's revenue stream may be affected.\nCompliance with state rules and regulations.\nVarious states have laws restricting gambling. The Company believes that we are in compliance with the rules and regulations in the states we operate. However, there can be no assurance that the state officials will have the same view. In the event that we are accused of violating such gambling laws and restrictions, our gaming business may be disallowed or prohibited in these states. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that no new rules and regulations restricting our business will be adopted in the states we operate. If such restrictive rules and regulations are adopted, we may incur additional costs in complying with the rules and regulations or we may have to cease operation in these state(s).\nWe have capacity constraints and system development risks that could damage our customer relations or inhibit our possible growth, and we may need to expand our management systems and controls quickly, which may increase our cost of operations.\nOur success and our ability to provide high quality customer service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and the computers and communication systems of our third party vendors in order to accommodate any significant numbers or increases in the numbers of consumers using our service. Our success also depends upon our and our vendors' abilities to rapidly expand transaction-processing systems and network infrastructure without any systems interruptions in order to accommodate any significant increases in use of our service.\nWe and our service providers may experience periodic systems interruptions and infrastructure failures, which we believe will cause customer dissatisfaction and may adversely affect our results of operations. Limitations of technology infrastructure may prevent us from maximizing our business opportunities.\nWe cannot assure you that our and our vendors' data repositories, financial systems and other technology resources will be secure from security breaches or sabotage, especially as technology changes and becomes more sophisticated. In addition, many of our and our vendors' software systems are custom-developed and we and our vendors rely on employees and certain third-party contractors to develop and maintain these systems. If certain of these employees or contractors become unavailable, we and our vendors may experience difficulty in improving and maintaining these systems. Furthermore, we expect that we and our vendors may continue to be required to manage multiple relationships with various software and equipment vendors whose technologies may not be compatible, as well as relationships with other third parties to maintain and enhance their technology infrastructures. Failure to achieve or maintain high capacity data transmission and security without system downtime and to achieve improvements in their transaction processing systems and network infrastructure could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreased security risks of online commerce may deter future use of our website, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nConcerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of consumers may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally, and online commerce in particular. Failure to prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business and results of operations. We cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used to protect our transaction data. Anyone who is able to circumvent our or our vendors' security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand and reputation. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or downloading sensitive materials, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face the risk of system failures, which would disrupt our operations.\nA disaster could severely damage our business and results of operations because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time. Our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, sabotage and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at our principal business headquarters or at a third-party facility could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data or render us unable to provide our services. In addition, failure of a third-party facility to provide the data communications capacity required by us, as a result of human error, natural disaster or other operational disruptions, could cause interruptions in our service. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business.\nWe face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business.\nOur services operate in part by making internet services and content available to our users. This creates the potential for claims to be made against us, either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with third parties. These claims might, for example, be made for defamation, negligence, copyright, trademark or patent infringement, personal injury, invasion of privacy or other legal theories. Any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend, divert management's attention and resources, cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries. We expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. There can be no assurance that our services do not or will not in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business.\nOur success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our technology and data resources, which we intend to protect through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and/or trademark law. We currently have no patents or trademarks issued to date on our technology and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in securing them when necessary.\nWe may not be able to protect our internet domain name, which is important to our branding strategy.\nOur internet domain name, www.draftday.com, is an extremely important part of our business. Governmental agencies and their designees generally regulate the acquisition and maintenance of domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries may be subject to change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business. Furthermore, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear. Therefore, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nIf we are unable to maintain our popularity with third party search engines then our customer base, and therefore, our revenue will not continue to grow.\nDue to our limited capital we do not run large advertising campaigns. Our competitors may have more resources to drive traffic to their websites in order to optimize their internet search ranking position, including the ability to conduct national television and radio advertising campaigns advertising our competitors\u2019 websites. This risk particularly effects DraftDay.com, as we may not have the resources to promote its sports-related content during televised sporting events such as the NFL Superbowl. We are, therefore, reliant on third party search engines such as Google and Yahoo! to provide prospective customers with links to facilitate traffic to our internet domain. We believe that these search engines are important in order to facilitate broad market acceptance of our service and thus enhance our sales. We continue to look for new methods to optimize our ranking position with various internet search engines, including the maintenance of reciprocal links with complementary third party sites.\nOur financial position and results of operations will vary depending on a number of factors, most of which are out of our control.\nWe anticipate that our operating results will vary widely depending on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors are likely to include:\n\u00b7 demand for our online services by consumers;\n\u00b7 costs of attracting consumers to our website, including costs of receiving exposure on third-party websites;\n\u00b7 costs related to forming strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 loss of strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 our ability to significantly increase our distribution channels;\n\u00b7 competition from companies offering same or similar products and services and from companies with much deeper financial, technical, marketing and human resources;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations;\n\u00b7 costs and delays in introducing new services and improvements to existing services;\n\u00b7 changes in the growth rate of internet usage and acceptance by consumers of electronic commerce; and\n\u00b7 changes and introduction of new software e.g. pop up blockers.????\nBecause we have a limited operating history, it is difficult to accurately forecast the revenues that will be generated from our current and proposed future product offerings.\nIf we are unable to meet the changing needs of our industry, our ability to compete will be adversely affected.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry. To remain competitive, we must be capable of enhancing and improving the functionality and features of our online services. The internet gaming industry is rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing services, technology and systems may become obsolete. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in responding quickly, cost effectively and adequately to new developments or that funds will be available to respond at all. Any failure by us to respond effectively would significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to accomplish the following:\n\u00b7 license and develop leading technologies useful in our business;\n\u00b7 develop and enhance our existing products and services;\n\u00b7 develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective consumers; and\n\u00b7 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nDeveloping internet services and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks, as well as substantial costs. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt our services, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to user requirements or emerging industry standards. If our operations face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements, our users may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur business may be subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that may increase the costs of operating our web portal, limit our ability to attract users, or interfere with future operations of the Company.\nThere are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to, or commerce on, the internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet, it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted, covering issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Such legislation could expose the Company to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet, decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium, or require the Company to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations.\nThe applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as gambling, property ownership, copyright, defamation, obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain. The Company may be subject to claims that our services violate such laws. Any new legislation or regulation in the United States or abroad or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could damage our business. In addition, because legislation and other regulations relating to online games vary by jurisdiction, from state to state and from country to country, it is difficult for us to ensure that our players are accessing our portal from a jurisdiction where it is legal to play our games. We therefore, cannot ensure that we will not be subject to enforcement actions as a result of this uncertainty and difficulty in controlling access.\nIn addition, our business may be indirectly affected by our suppliers or customers who may be subject to such legislation. Increased regulation of the internet may decrease the growth in the use of the internet or hamper the development of internet commerce and online entertainment, which could decrease the demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our business and operating results.\nIf Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) or courts implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our business model. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (or the Leahy-Smith Act), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act will not become effective until one year or 18 months after enactment. Accordingly, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurther, and in general, it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to license or otherwise monetize our intellectual property or generate revenue and profit through those assets, there is a significant risk that our intellectual property monetization strategy will fail.\nEffective June 1, 2012, we acquired an interest in the \u2018088 Patent, entitled \u201cGaming Device Having a Second Separate Bonusing Event\u201d that we plan to license or otherwise monetize. On August 6, 2013, the Company was issued United States Patent number 8,500,554 entitled, \"Gaming Device Having a Second Bonusing Event\" (the \"554 Patent\"). The '554 Patent is a continuation of the key patent already owned by the Company. If our efforts to generate revenue from the \u2018088 Patent fail, we will incur significant losses and may be unable to acquire additional intellectual property assets. If this occurs, our patent monetization strategy will likely fail.\nWe plan to commence additional legal proceedings against companies in the gaming industry to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we expect such litigation to be time-consuming, which may adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business.\nTo license or otherwise monetize the \u2018088 Patent, we have commenced legal proceedings against the owners of gaming devices pursuant to which we allege that such companies infringed on the Patent. Our viability will be highly dependent on the outcome of this litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results that we desire from such litigation, which failure would harm our overall business. In addition, the potential defendants in the litigation are much larger than us and have substantially greater resources, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult.\nDisputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in potential lawsuits may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive licensing revenue from our patents. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nWhile we believe that the \u2018088 Patent is infringed upon by certain companies, there is a risk that a court will find the \u2018088 Patent invalid, not infringed or unenforceable and/or that the USPTO will either invalidate the \u2018088 Patent or materially narrow the scope of its claims during the course of a re-examination. In addition, even with a positive trial court verdict, the \u2018088 Patent may be invalidated, found not to be infringed or rendered unenforceable on appeal. This risk may occur in litigations we bring. If this were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on the viability of the Company and our operations.\nWe believe that certain gaming companies infringe on the \u2018088 Patent, but recognize that obtaining and collecting a judgment against such infringers may be difficult or impossible. Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Some of the parties that we believe infringe on the \u2018088 Patent are large and well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. We believe that these parties would devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing on the \u2018088 Patent or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages.\nIn addition there is a risk that these parties may file re-examinations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable the \u2018088 Patent.\nAt this time, we cannot predict the outcome of such litigation or administrative action, and if we are unsuccessful in our litigation efforts for any reason, our business would be significantly harmed.\nMoreover, in connection with any of our present or future patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may claim and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or award attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses to one or more of the defendants, which could be material, and if we are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and financial position.\nIn addition, it is difficult in general to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. There is a higher rate of appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time-consuming, and the outcomes of such appeals are sometimes unpredictable, resulting in increased costs and reduced or delayed revenue.\nFinally, we believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to license the \u2018088 Patent without engaging in litigation. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the \u2018088 Patent or pay damages for lost royalties. This will adversely affect our operating results due to the high costs of litigation and the uncertainty of the results.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may be uncertain and we may face claims of others.\nAlthough we have received patents and have filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of our technology, we generally do not rely on patent protection with respect to our products and technologies. Instead, we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret and copyright law, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technologies. Such measures may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know how or other intellectual property in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies. In addition, to the extent that we apply for any patents, such applications may not result in issued patents or, if issued, such patents may not be valid or of value. Third parties could, in the future, assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future products and technologies, or we may need to assert claims of infringement against third parties. Any infringement or misappropriation claim by us or against us could place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. The costs of prosecuting or defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could adversely affect our business, even if we are ultimately successful in prosecuting or defending any such claims. If our products or technologies are found to infringe the rights of a third party, we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees or cease production, any of which could have material adverse effect on our business. If a claim is brought against us, or we ultimately prove unsuccessful on the claims on our merits, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our patent assets or other intellectual property rights could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results.\nOur ability to compete in the intellectual property market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets and other intellectual property. To protect our proprietary rights, we will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain our intellectual property assets will have any measure of success.\nFollowing the acquisition of patent assets, we will likely be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of those assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications, which require us to spend resources to prosecute the applications with the USPTO. Further, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims, or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our other activities.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property:\n\u00b7 our applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7 issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages versus potentially infringing parties;\n\u00b7 our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u00b7 our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nWe are in a developing industry with limited revenues from operations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and generate limited revenues from operations. As a result, we have generated negative cash flows from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $299,163 as of December 31, 2014. We are operating in a developing industry based on a new technology and our primary source of funds to date has been through the issuance of securities and borrowing funds. There can be no assurance that management\u2019s efforts will be successful or that the products we develop and market will be accepted by consumers. If our products are ultimately unsuccessful in the market, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe face financial risks as we are a developing company.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and have limited revenue from operations. As a result, we have generated negative cash flows from operations and our cash balances continue to reduce. While we are optimistic and believe appropriate actions are being taken to mitigate this, there can be no assurance that attempts to reduce cash outflows will be successful and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nWe may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThere is intense competition from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our marketing and development activities, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIf we do not effectively manage growth or changes in our business, these changes could place a significant strain on our management and operations.\nTo manage our growth successfully, we must continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner. Our controls, systems, procedures and resources may not be adequate to support a changing and growing company. If our management fails to respond effectively to changes and growth in our business, including acquisitions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe need to manage growth in operations to maximize our potential growth and achieve our expected revenues. Our failure to manage growth can cause a disruption of our operations that may result in the failure to generate revenues at levels we expect.\nIn order to maximize potential growth in our current markets, we may have to expand our operations. Such expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate, and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nGeneral market risks\nWe may not be able to access credit.\nWe face the risk that we may not be able to access credit, either from lenders or suppliers. Failure to access credit from any of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective internal controls.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal accounting controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an on-going basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nSecurities market risks\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our Common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition and could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Common stock. We cannot predict the potential impact of these periods of volatility on the price of our Common stock. The Company cannot assure you that the market price of our Common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIf our Common stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT LLC, the Company would be subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nIf our Common stock were to be delisted from trading on the NYSE MKT LLC and the trading price of the Common stock were below $5.00 per share on the date the Common stock were delisted, trading in our Common stock would also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \"penny stock\" and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nIf we need additional capital to fund the growth of our operations, and cannot obtain sufficient capital, we may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nAs we implement our growth strategies, we may experience increased capital needs. We may not, however, have sufficient capital to fund our future operations without additional capital investments. If adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to carry out our corporate strategy and we would be forced to modify our business plans (e.g., limit our expansion, limit our marketing efforts and/or decrease or eliminate capital expenditures), any of which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Such reduction could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to compete.\nOur capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including, without limitation, (i) our profitability or lack thereof, (ii) our ability to respond to a release of competitive products by our competitors, and (iii) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions. Moreover, the costs involved may exceed those originally contemplated. Cost savings and other economic benefits expected may not materialize as a result of any cost overruns or changes in market circumstances. Failure to obtain intended economic benefits could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating performances.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our Common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. There is no guarantee that shares of our Common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 91050, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "MGTI"}
