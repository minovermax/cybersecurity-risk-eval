Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our ebusiness, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nCertain Risk Factors Relating to Polarity\nRapid technological change could cause Polarity\u2019s platform, PolarityTE, to become obsolete.\nThe technologies underlying Polarity\u2019s platform, PolarityTE, are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. Polarity can give no assurance that others will not develop processes with significant advantages over the processes that Polarity offers or is seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material and adverse effect on Polarity\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPolarity\u2019s revenues will depend upon adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\nPolarity\u2019s success will depend on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of its treatments will be available from third party payers, such as public and private insurers and health systems. Government and other third party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new treatments. Therefore, significant uncertainty usually exists as to the reimbursement status of new healthcare treatments. If Polarity is not successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement for its treatment from these third party payers, the market's acceptance of Polarity\u2019s treatment could be adversely affected. Inadequate reimbursement levels also likely would create downward price pressure on Polarity\u2019s treatment. Even if Polarity does succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement for its treatment, future changes in reimbursement policies could have a negative impact on Polarity\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo be commercially successful, Polarity must convince physicians that its treatments are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that Polarity\u2019s treatments should be used.\nPolarity believes physicians will only adopt its treatment if they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of Polarity\u2019s treatment is a favorable alternative to conventional methods, including skin grating. Physicians may be slow to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u25cf Lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits and Polarity\u2019s treatments over conventional methods;\n\u25cf Perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new procedures; and\n\u25cf Limited availability of reimbursement from third party payers.\nIn addition, Polarity believes that recommendations for and support of its treatments by influential physicians are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If Polarity does not receive this support or is unable to demonstrate favorable long-term clinical data, physicians and hospitals may not use Polarity\u2019s treatment, which would significantly reduce Polarity\u2019s ability to achieve revenue and would prevent Polarity from sustaining profitability.\nPolarity\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on Polarity.\nPolarity\u2019s success depends significantly on its ability to protect its proprietary rights to the technologies used in it treatment and PolarityTE platform. Polarity relies on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary technology. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect Polarity\u2019s rights or permit Polarity to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, Polarity\u2019s pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of Polarity\u2019s procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. Polarity cannot ensure that any of its pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around Polarity\u2019s patents or develop procedures that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to Polarity\u2019s. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect Polarity\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents and/or protect Polarity\u2019s intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on Polarity\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Whether a patent is valid is a complex matter of science and law, and therefore Polarity cannot be certain that, if challenged, its patents would be upheld. If one or more of those patents are invalidated, that could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage Polarity might otherwise have had.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon Polarity\u2019s pending patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend Polarity\u2019s intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert Polarity\u2019s management's attention. Further, bringing litigation to enforce Polarity\u2019s patents subjects Polarity to the potential for counterclaims. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm Polarity\u2019s competitive position. If the USPTO ultimately cancels or narrows the claim in any of Polarity\u2019s patents through these proceedings, it could prevent or hinder Polarity from being able to enforce them against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact Polarity\u2019s future, expected revenue.\nPolarity may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit Polarity from developing its treatment, require Polarity to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject Polarity to substantial monetary damages.\nThird parties could assert that Polarity\u2019s procedures infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a product infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, Polarity cannot be certain that it has not infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there also may be applications now pending of which Polarity is unaware that may later result in issued patents that Polarity\u2019s procedure or processes infringe. There also may be existing patents or pending patent applications of which Polarity is unaware that its procedures or processes may inadvertently infringe.\nAny infringement claim could cause Polarity to incur significant costs, place significant strain on Polarity\u2019s financial resources, divert management's attention from Polarity\u2019s business and harm Polarity\u2019s reputation. If the relevant patents in such claim were upheld as valid and enforceable and Polarity was found to infringe, Polarity could be prohibited from utilizing any procedure that is found to infringe unless Polarity obtains licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or other intellectual property or is able to design around the patent or other intellectual property. Polarity may be unable to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to it, if at all, and Polarity may not be able to redesign it\u2019s processes to avoid infringement. A court could also order Polarity to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm Polarity\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nPolarity\u2019s business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and other authorities, which is costly and Polarity\u2019s failure to comply could result in negative effects on its business.\nThe FDA has specific regulations governing tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. The FDA's regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products, donor screening and testing, processing and distribution (\u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d), labeling, record keeping and adverse-reaction reporting, and inspection and enforcement.\nEven if pre-market clearance or approval is obtained, the approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed, may require warnings to accompany the product or impose additional restrictions on the sale and/or use of the product. In addition, regulatory approval is subject to continuing compliance with regulatory standards, including the FDA's quality system regulations.\nIf Polarity fails to comply with the FDA regulations regarding its tissue regeneration processes, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u25cf Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of procedure;\n\u25cf Refusing requests for clearance or approval of new procedures;\n\u25cf Withdrawing or suspending current applications for approval or approvals already granted; and\n\u25cf Criminal prosecution.\nIt is likely that the FDA's regulation of HCT/Ps will continue to evolve in the future. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have a material adverse effect on Polarity\u2019s business.\nPolarity faces significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the Federal Government, State Governments, regulators and third party payers to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences are not fully understood. These proposals may affect aspects of Polarity\u2019s business. Polarity also cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on Polarity.\nOversight in the industry might affect the manner in which Polarity may compete in the marketplace.\nThere are laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their treatments to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their treatments, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, in some instances civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation, and from time to time Polarity may find itself at a competitive disadvantage if Polarity\u2019s interpretation differs from that of our competitors.\nPolarity may have significant liability exposure and its insurance may not cover all potential claims.\nPolarity is exposed to liability and other claims in the event that its treatment is alleged to have caused harm. Polarity may not be able to obtain insurance for the potential liability on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs. Any potential product liability claims could exceed the amount of Polarity\u2019s insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Polarity\u2019s insurance may not be renewed at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that then in effect.\nIf the NASDAQ Stock Market determines that the Merger with Polarity and the issuance of the Merger Consideration results in a change of control of the Company, the Company may be required to submit a new application under NASDAQ\u2019s original listing standards and if such application is not approved, the Company\u2019s common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company will issue 7,050 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, which are convertible into an aggregate of 7,050,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. NASDAQ Rule 5110(a) provides that a Company must apply for initial listing in connection with a transaction whereby a company combines with a non-NASDAQ entity, resulting in a change of control of such company and potentially allowing the non-NASDAQ entity to effectively obtain NASDAQ listing. In determining whether a change of control has occurred, NASDAQ considers all relevant factors including, changes in management, board of directors, voting power, ownership and financial structure of the Company. If The NASDAQ Stock Market determines that a change of control does in fact result from the consummation of the Merger and the issuance of the Merger Consideration and an original listing application has not been approved prior to the consummation of Merger, the Company will be in violation of NASDAQ Rule 5110(a) and the Company\u2019s common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nCertain Other Risk Factors\nOur financial resources are limited and we will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our business.\nWe do not expect to generate the level of revenues going forward that we have achieved in prior years from our video game business. This significantly reduced revenue will impact our needs for future capital. We cannot ensure that additional funding will be available or, if it is available, that it can be obtained on terms and conditions we will deem acceptable. Any additional funding derived from the sale of equity securities is likely to result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that may prevent us from raising additional capital or may cause the terms upon which we raise additional capital, if additional capital is available, to be less favorable to us than would otherwise be the case. If we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to cease our business activities and dissolve the Company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various severances, contract termination, and other dissolution-related obligations.\nWe have experienced recent net losses and we may incur future net losses, which may cause a decrease in our stock price.\nWe incurred net losses of $4.6 million in fiscal 2016 and $3.8 million in fiscal 2015. We may not be able to generate revenues sufficient to offset our costs and may sustain net losses in future periods. Any such losses may have an adverse effect on our future operating prospects, liquidity and stock price.\nWe have experienced volatility in the price of our stock and are subject to volatility in the future.\nThe price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility. The high and low bid quotations for our common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Capital Market, ranged between a high of $14.22 and a low of $3.03 during the past 24 months. The historic market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price paid for our shares and may not be indicative of future market prices, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, as we have significantly reduced our video game operations, and are seeking strategic alternatives, we cannot predict the performance of our stock. The price of our stock may change dramatically in response to our success or failure to consummate a strategic transaction.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock by us or by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional equity financings or other share issuances by us, including shares issued in connection with strategic alliances and corporate partnering transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market. This market has continued listing requirements that we must continue to maintain to avoid delisting. The standards include, among others, a minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share and any of: (i) a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million; (ii) a market value of listed securities of $35 million; or (iii) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in the two of the last three fiscal years. Our results of operations and our fluctuating stock price directly impact our ability to satisfy these listing standards. In the event we are unable to maintain these listing standards, we may be subject to delisting.\nA delisting from NASDAQ would result in our common stock being eligible for quotation on the Over-The-Counter market which is generally considered to be a less efficient system than listing on markets such as NASDAQ or other national exchanges because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays and reduced security analyst and news media coverage. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Additionally, trading of our common stock on the OTCBB may make us less desirable to institutional investors and may, therefore, limit our future equity funding options and could negatively affect the liquidity of our stock.\nThe rights of our common stockholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock; these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock.\nThe holders of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock have rights and preferences generally superior to those of the holders of common stock. The existence of these superior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the certificates of designations governing these instruments, and include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nthe right to convert into shares of our common stock at the conversion price set forth in the certificates of designations governing the respective preferred stock, which may be adjusted as set forth therein.\nA decrease in the popularity of our licensed brands and, correspondingly, the video games we publish based on those brands could negatively impact our revenues and financial position.\nCertain games released in 2014 and 2015 were based upon popular licensed brands. A decrease in the popularity of our licensed properties would negatively impact our ability to sell games based upon such licenses and could lead to lower net sales, profitability, and/or an impairment of our licenses, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nA weak global economic environment could result in increased volatility in our stock price.\nCurrent uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy as consumers and retailers may defer or choose not to make purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which could negatively affect demand for our products. Additionally, due to the weak economic conditions and tightened credit environment, some of our retailers and customers may not have the same purchasing power, leading to lower purchases of our games for placement into distribution channels. Reduced consumer demand for our products could materially impact our operating results.\nTermination or modification of our agreements with platform hardware manufacturers may adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to obtain a license in order to develop and distribute software for each of the manufacturers of video game hardware. We currently have licenses from: (i) Sony to develop products for PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4; (ii) from Nintendo to develop products for the DS, DSi, 3DS, Wii and WiiU; and (iii) from Microsoft to develop products for the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. These licenses must be periodically renewed, and if they are not, or if any of our licenses are terminated or adversely modified, we may not be able to distribute any of our games on that platform or we may be required to do so on less attractive terms.\nOur platform licensors control the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms.\nPursuant to the terms of certain publisher license agreements, platform licensors retain sole discretion to determine the fees to be charged for both base level and premium online services available via their online platforms. Each licensor\u2019s ability to set royalty rates makes it challenging for us to predict our costs, and increased costs may negatively impact our operating margins. As a result of such varying fee structures, we may be unable to distribute our games in a cost-effective manner through such distribution channels.\nIntellectual property claims may increase our costs or require us to cease selling affected products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of original content, including publication and distribution, sometimes results in claims of intellectual property infringement. Although we make efforts to ensure our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties may still allege infringement. These claims and any litigation resulting from these claims may result in damage awards payable by us; could prevent us from selling the affected product; or require us to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement or obtain a license for future sales of the affected product.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation resulting from these claims could require us to incur substantial costs.\nA reduced workforce presents additional risk to the effectiveness of our internal controls.\nWe have significantly reduced our workforce. A smaller workforce impacts our ability to continue to undertake our historic business which could have an impact on our ability to maintain internal controls including over financial reporting, and can affect the adequacy of our controls. We cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting are or will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nOur reputation with consumers is critical to our success. Negative consumer perceptions about our brands, games, services and/or business practices may damage our business and any costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses.\nIndividual consumers form our ultimate customer base, and consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons. These negative consumer reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. Actions we take to address consumer concerns may be costly and, in any case, may not be successful. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation. Any of these may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may negatively impact our business.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity could suffer materially.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles, whether due to competitive pressure, because retailers elect to price these products at a lower price or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further, we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our new resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies, delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform, operating system or media format, we often are required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both. If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model, that achieves significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model. Any failure to successfully adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emerging technologies could negatively impact our business.\nCompetition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.\nWithin the interactive entertainment industry, we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software developed for use on the PC, video game consoles and handheld, mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites, both within the United States and, increasingly, in international jurisdictions. Our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. A relatively small number of titles account for a significant portion of net revenues, and an even greater portion of net profit, in the interactive entertainment industry, and the availability of significant financial resources is a major competitive factor in the production of high-quality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately well-received. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful products for the PC or video game platforms than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers, who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors' more popular titles.\nIncreased consumer acceptance and availability of interactive entertainment developed for use by consumers on handheld, mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites or other online games, consumer acceptance and availability of technology which allows users to play games on televisions without consoles, or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in sales of our platform-based software.\nAdditionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services such as social networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if consumers and potential consumers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the Internet, including those online services. Further, it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to the competitive pressures described herein could negatively impact our business.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in material adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance and commercial claims. Such claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.\nOur products are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in the U.S. and similar agencies in international jurisdictions. Our failure to obtain our target ratings for our products could negatively impact our business.\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \"ESRB\") is a self-regulatory body based in the United States that provides consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content contained in software titles. The ESRB rating categories are \"Early Childhood\" (i.e., content is intended for young children), \"Everyone\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for all ages), \"Everyone 10+\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 10 and up), \"Teen\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up), \"Mature\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up) and \"Adults Only\" (i.e., content is suitable for adults ages 18 and up). Certain countries other than the United States have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In some countries, a company may be required to modify its products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if an agency re-rates one of our games for any reason, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies purchased. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products as a result of changes in a content rating organization's ratings standards or for other reasons, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. For example, privacy laws and regulatory guidance in many countries impose various restrictions on online and mobile advertising, as well as the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. We may be required to modify certain of our product development processes or alter our marketing strategies to comply with such regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, many foreign countries, such as China and Germany, have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict the content and/or advertising of interactive entertainment software or prohibit certain types of content. Further, legislation which attempts to restrict marketing or distribution of such products because of the content therein has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States. There is on-going risk of enhanced regulation of interactive entertainment marketing, content or sales. These laws and regulations vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. The adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing, content or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties. Moreover, the increased public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products.", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
