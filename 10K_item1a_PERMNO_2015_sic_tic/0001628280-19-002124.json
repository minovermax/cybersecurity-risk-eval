We describe below the most significant risks that management believes affect or could affect us. Understanding these risks is important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report and to evaluating an investment in our common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report before you make any decision regarding an investment in our common stock. You should also consider the information set forth above under \u201cForward Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could significantly decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. While the following discussion provides a description of some of the important risks that could cause our results to vary materially from those expressed in public statements or documents, other factors besides those discussed within this Annual Report or elsewhere in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC could also affect our business or results.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation and Financial Regulatory Reforms\nThe business in which we engage is complex and heavily regulated. If we fail to operate our business in compliance with both existing and future regulations, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, the SEC and various state agencies that license and conduct examinations of our servicing and lending activities. In addition, we operate under a number of regulatory settlements that subject us to ongoing reporting and other obligations. See the next risk factor below for additional detail concerning these regulatory settlements. From time to time, we also receive requests (including requests in the form of subpoenas and civil investigative demands) from federal, state and local agencies for records, documents and information relating to our servicing and lending activities. The GSEs (and their conservator, the FHFA), Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, various investors, non-Agency securitization trustees and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits.\nIn the current regulatory environment, we have faced and expect to continue to face heightened regulatory and public scrutiny as an organization as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of the entire mortgage sector. We must devote substantial resources to regulatory compliance, and we incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant ongoing costs to comply with new and existing laws and governmental regulation of our business. If we fail to effectively manage our regulatory and contractual compliance, the resources we are required to devote and our compliance expenses would likely increase. We have identified fulfilling our regulatory commitments and resolving remaining legacy matters as a key initiative in the first phase of our plan to return to profitability while executing the integration with PHH. Any significant delay or complication in fulfilling our regulatory commitments may jeopardize our ability to return to profitability and to obtain the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of PHH.\nWe must comply with a large number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, RESPA, TILA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as well as individual state licensing and foreclosure laws and federal and local bankruptcy rules. These statutes apply to many facets of our business, including loan origination, default servicing and collections, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about our customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d for additional information regarding our regulators and the laws that apply to us.\nTo be successful, we must structure and operate our business to comply with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our regulatory settlements. This can require judgment with respect to the requirements of such laws and regulations and such\nsettlements. While we endeavor to engage regularly with our regulators in an effort to ensure we do so correctly, if we fail to interpret correctly the requirements of such laws and regulations or the terms of our regulatory settlements, we could be found to be in breach of such laws, regulations or settlements.\nOur actual or alleged failure to comply with the terms of our regulatory settlements or applicable federal, state and local consumer protection laws, regulations and licensing requirements could lead to any of the following:\n\u2022\nadministrative fines and penalties and litigation;\n\u2022\nloss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses;\n\u2022\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities;\n\u2022\nbreaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ninability to raise capital or otherwise secure the necessary financing to operate the business;\n\u2022\nchanges to our operations that may otherwise not occur in the normal course, and that could cause us to incur significant transition costs; or\n\u2022\ninability to execute on our business strategy.\nAny of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the general trend among federal, state and local lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings with regard to residential mortgage lenders and servicers. The CFPB continues to take a very active role in the mortgage industry, and its rule-making and regulatory agenda relating to loan servicing and originations continues to evolve. Individual states have also been active, as have other regulatory organizations such as the MMC. We also believe there has been a shift among certain regulators towards a broader view of the scope of regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to mortgage originators and servicers. In addition to their traditional focus on licensing and examination matters, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to such areas as corporate governance, safety and soundness, and risk and compliance management. We must endeavor to work cooperatively with our regulators to understand all their concerns if we are to be successful in our business.\nFollowing the 2018 Congressional elections, a level of heightened uncertainty exists with respect to the future of regulation of mortgage lending and servicing, including the future of the Dodd Frank Act and CFPB. We cannot predict the specific legislative or executive actions that may result or what actions federal or state regulators might take in response to potential changes to the Dodd Frank Act or to the federal regulatory environment generally. Such actions could impact the industry generally or us specifically, could impact our relationships with other regulators, and could adversely impact our business and limit our ability to reach an appropriate resolution with the CFPB with which we are engaged to attempt to resolve certain concerns relating to our mortgage servicing practices, as described in the next risk factor.\nThe CFPB and state regulators have also increasingly focused on the use, and adequacy, of technology in the mortgage servicing industry. In 2016, the CFPB issued a special edition supervision report that stressed the need for mortgage servicers to assess and make necessary improvements to their information technology systems in order to ensure compliance with the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing requirements. The NY DFS also issued Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, effective in 2017, which require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NY DFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State\u2019s financial services industry.\nNew regulatory and legislative measures, or changes in enforcement practices, including those related to the technology we use, could, either individually or in the aggregate, require significant changes to our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, negatively impact asset values or reduce our revenues. Accordingly, they could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nGovernmental bodies have taken regulatory and legal actions against us in the past and may in the future impose regulatory fines or penalties or impose additional requirements or restrictions on our activities that could increase our operating expenses, reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to grow and reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions that could result in further adverse regulatory action against us. These matters are summarized below.\nCFPB\nIn April 2017, the CFPB filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, OMS and OLS alleging violations of federal consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business dating back to 2014. The CFPB\u2019s claims include allegations regarding (1) the adequacy of Ocwen\u2019s servicing system and integrity of Ocwen\u2019s mortgage servicing data, (2) Ocwen\u2019s foreclosure practices and (3) various purported servicer errors with respect to borrower escrow accounts, hazard insurance policies, timely cancellation of private mortgage insurance, handling of customer complaints, and marketing of optional products. The CFPB alleges violations of unfair, deceptive acts or abusive practices, as well as violations of specific laws or regulations. The CFPB does not claim specific monetary damages, although it does seek consumer relief, disgorgement of allegedly improper gains, and civil money penalties. While we believe we have factual and legal defenses to the CFPB\u2019s allegations and are vigorously defending ourselves, it is possible that resolution of the matters raised by the CFPB could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nState Licensing and State Attorneys General\nOur licensed entities are required to renew their licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so they must satisfy the license renewal requirements of each jurisdiction, which generally include financial requirements such as providing audited financial statements or satisfying minimum net worth requirements and non-financial requirements such as satisfactorily completing examinations as to the licensee\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The minimum net worth requirements to which our licensed entities are subject are unique to each state and type of license. We believe our licensed entities were in compliance with all of their minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2018. However, it is possible that regulators could disagree with our calculations, and one state regulator has disagreed with our calculation for a prior year period; we are currently discussing the matter with the regulator. Failure to satisfy any of the requirements to which our licensed entities are subject could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from a fine, a directive requiring a certain step to be taken, a suspension or, ultimately, a revocation of a license, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn April 2017 and shortly thereafter, mortgage and banking regulatory agencies from 29 states and the District of Columbia took regulatory actions against OLS and certain other Ocwen companies that alleged deficiencies in our compliance with laws and regulations relating to our servicing and lending activities. These regulatory actions generally took the form of orders styled as \u201ccease and desist orders\u201d and prohibited a range of actions relating to our lending and servicing activities.\nWe entered into agreements with all 29 states plus the District of Columbia to resolve these regulatory actions. These agreements generally contained the Multi-State Common Settlement Terms.\nIn addition to the terms described above, Ocwen entered into settlements with certain states on different or additional terms, which include making additional communications with and for borrowers, certain restrictions, certain review, reporting and remediation obligations, and requirements to make certain monetary payments.\nWe will also incur costs complying with the terms of these settlements, including in connection with the escrow analysis and the transition to Black Knight MSP. In addition, the remediation of errors identified during the escrow analysis could result in payments, credits or other actions to remediate such errors and other actions could be taken against us by regulators or others with respect to such errors.\nAlthough we have resolved all of the administrative actions taken by state regulators in April 2017 and shortly thereafter, we have not resolved all of the legal actions. In April 2017, and concurrent with the issuance of the cease and desist orders and the filing of the CFPB lawsuit discussed above, two state attorneys general took actions against us relating to our servicing practices. The Florida Attorney General, together with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, OMS and OLS alleging violations of federal and state consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business. These claims are similar to the claims made by the CFPB. The Florida lawsuit seeks injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and civil money penalties in excess of $10,000 per confirmed violation of the applicable statute. As previously disclosed, the Massachusetts Attorney General had sent us a civil investigative demand requesting information relating to various aspects of our servicing practices, including lender-placed insurance and property preservation fees. Subsequently, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against OLS in the Superior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alleging violations of state consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business, including with respect to our activities relating to lender-placed insurance and property preservation fees. The Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit seeks injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and civil money penalties of $5,000 per confirmed violation of the applicable statute. While we endeavor to negotiate appropriate resolutions in these two matters, we are vigorously defending ourselves, as we believe we have valid defenses to the claims made in both lawsuits. The outcome of these two lawsuits, whether through negotiated settlements, court rulings or otherwise, could potentially involve monetary fines or penalties or additional restrictions on our business and could be materially adverse to our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nCertain of the state regulators\u2019 cease and desist orders referenced the MOU that we entered into with the MMC and six states relating to a servicing examination from 2013 to 2015. The MOU contained various provisions relating to servicing practices and safety and soundness aspects of the regulatory review, as a step toward closing the 2013 - 2015 examination. Ocwen responded to the MOU items and continues to provide certain reports and other information pursuant to the MOU.\nThere were no monetary or other penalties imposed under the MOU. However, the MOU prohibited us from repurchasing stock during the development of a going forward plan and, thereafter, except as permitted by the plan. We prepared and submitted a plan that contained no stock repurchase restrictions and, therefore, we do not believe we are currently restricted from repurchasing stock. However, the MMC may not agree with our interpretation. For this reason, and on the basis of our progress to date responding to our obligations under the MOU, we have requested that the MOU be terminated. To the extent that we cannot terminate the MOU, we may remain subject to a share repurchase restriction and continued reporting obligations.\nIn January 2018, prior to our acquisition of PHH, PMC entered into a settlement agreement with the MMC and consent orders with certain state attorneys general to resolve and close out findings of an MMC examination of PMC\u2019s legacy mortgage servicing practices. Under the terms of these settlements, PMC agreed to comply with certain servicing standards, to conduct testing of compliance with such servicing standards for a period of three years, and to report to the MMC regarding the same. To the extent PMC does not comply with the terms of the servicing standards, the MMC or state attorneys general could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities.\nWe continue to work with the NY DFS to address matters they continue to raise with us as well as to fulfill our commitments under the 2017 NY Consent Order and PHH acquisition conditional approval. To the extent that we fail to address adequately any concerns raised by the NY DFS or fail to fulfill our commitments to the NY DFS, the NY DFS could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations.\nPursuant to the 2017 CA Consent Order, we continue to work on completing our debt forgiveness obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that we have approximately $15.0 million of debt forgiveness remaining to complete. Based on internal forecasting, we currently believe that we will be able to complete this requirement by June 30, 2019. However, if we are unable to complete this requirement by the deadline or obtain an extension, the 2017 CA Consent Order obligates us to pay the remaining amount to the CA DBO in cash. If the CA DBO were to allege that we failed to comply with our obligations under the 2017 CA Consent Order or that we otherwise were in breach of applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, the CA DBO could also take regulatory actions against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations.\nOther Matters\nOn occasion, we engage with agencies of the federal government on various matters, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of HUD and SIGTARP. In addition to the expense of responding to subpoenas and other requests for information from such agencies, in the event that any of these engagements result in allegations of wrongdoing by us, we may incur fines or penalties or significant legal expenses defending ourselves against such allegations.\nIn recent years, we have entered into significant settlements with the NY DFS and the CA DBO, and the 2013 Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement. These settlements involved payments of monetary amounts, ongoing monitoring by third-party firms for which we were financially responsible and other restrictions on our business. For example, we recognized $177.5 million in third-party monitoring costs alone relating to these settlements. While we are not currently subject to active monitorships under these settlements, we remain obligated to comply with the commitments made to our regulators and if we violate those commitments one or more of these entities could take regulatory action against us. In addition, to the extent we are unable to avoid future settlements or other regulatory actions against us, our business, operating results and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that an examination or other regulatory engagement results in an alleged failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, or if allegations are made that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements or the commitments we have made in connection with our regulatory settlements (whether such allegations are made through administrative actions such as cease and desist orders, through legal proceedings or otherwise) or if other regulatory actions of a similar or different nature are taken in the future against us, this could lead to (i) administrative fines and penalties and litigation, (ii) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses, (iii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iv) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities, (v) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (vi) damage to our reputation, (vii) inability to raise capital or otherwise fund our operations and (viii) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these occurrences could increase\nour operating expenses and reduce our revenues, hamper our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur regulatory settlements and public allegations regarding our business practices by regulators and other third parties may affect other regulators\u2019 and rating agencies\u2019 perceptions, as well as our overall public reputation, all of which can have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations.\nOur regulatory settlements and public allegations regarding our business practices by regulators and other third parties may affect other regulators\u2019 and rating agencies\u2019 perceptions of us. As a result, our ordinary course interactions with regulators may be adversely affected. We may incur additional compliance costs and management time may be diverted from other aspects of our business to address regulatory issues. It is possible that we may incur additional fines or penalties or even that we could lose the licenses and approvals necessary to engage in our servicing and lending businesses. In addition, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to areas such as corporate governance, safety and soundness and risk and compliance management, which could result in additional obligations such as liquidity and capital requirements or restrictions on business conduct such as engaging in stock repurchases.\nFurther, our ability to serve and retain customers and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our public reputation is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, the various regulatory and operational challenges facing Ocwen could give rise to further reputational risk and cause additional harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about Ocwen or the mortgage industry generally;\n\u2022\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including alleged deceptive or unfair servicing or lending practices;\n\u2022\nour practices relating to collections, foreclosures, property preservation, modifications, loans impacted by natural disasters, escrow and insurance;\n\u2022\nconsumer privacy issues;\n\u2022\nconsumer financial fraud issues;\n\u2022\ndata security issues related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\nrecordkeeping;\n\u2022\ncustomer service or consumer complaints;\n\u2022\nthe proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our servicer or credit ratings;\n\u2022\nappropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and\n\u2022\ngeneral company performance.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. The failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could give rise to increased regulatory action, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches or system failures may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers, expose our business and our customers to harm and otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nDisruptions and failures of our systems or those of our vendors may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers, expose us to remedial costs and reputational damage, and otherwise adversely affect our operations. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other electronic distribution and communication systems is essential to our maintaining consumer confidence in certain of our services. We have programs in place to detect and respond to security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. None of the cybersecurity incidents we have experienced to date has been material to our business, financial condition or operations.\nIn addition, consumers generally are concerned with security breaches and privacy on the Internet, and Congress or individual states could enact new laws regulating the use of technology in our business that could adversely affect us or result in significant compliance costs. As such, the NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation requires New York insurance companies, banks, and other regulated financial services institutions - including Ocwen as a non-bank financial services company licensed in the state of New York - to assess their cybersecurity risk profile. In particular, regulated entities are required, among other things, to adopt the core requirements of a cybersecurity program, including a cybersecurity policy, effective access privileges, cybersecurity risk assessments, training and monitoring for all authorized users, and appropriate governance processes. This\nregulation also requires regulated entities to submit notices to the NY DFS of any security breaches or other cybersecurity events, and to certify their compliance with all aspects of the regulation on an annual basis. Ocwen has enhanced its existing cybersecurity program in order to comply with these requirements.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, cyberattacks, hacking and other acts of vandalism are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect our borrowers\u2019 personal information and transaction data and other information that we must keep secure. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a cyberattack, a spike in transaction volume or unforeseen catastrophic events, potentially resulting in data loss and adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. If one or more of such events occurs, this could potentially jeopardize data integrity or confidentiality of information processed and stored in, or transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, which could result in our facing significant losses, reputational damage and legal liabilities.\nOur regulatory settlements have significantly reduced the size of our servicing portfolio and harmed our reputation with potential future customers.\nOur servicing portfolio naturally decreases over time as homeowners make regularly scheduled mortgage payments, prepay loans prior to maturity, refinance with a mortgage loan not serviced by us or involuntarily liquidate through foreclosure or other liquidation process. Our ability to maintain the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to acquire the right to service or subservice additional pools of mortgage loans or to originate additional loans for which we retain the MSRs.\nOur regulatory settlements have significantly impacted our ability to maintain or grow our servicing portfolio because we agreed to certain restrictions that effectively prohibited future bulk acquisitions of residential servicing. While certain of these restrictions have been eased in connection with our resolution of state regulatory matters and acquisition of PHH, we are still restricted in our ability to grow our portfolio under the terms of our agreements with the NY DFS, the Massachusetts Division of Banks, and the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions of the regulatory commitments we made to these and other regulators, or if a future regulatory settlement restricts our ability to acquire MSRs, we will be unable to grow or even maintain the size of our servicing portfolio through acquisitions and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, even when regulatory restrictions are lifted, the reputational damage done by these actions may inhibit our ability to acquire new business.\nWe have identified replenishing portfolio runoff and restoring a growth focus as key initiatives in the first phase of our plan to return to profitability while executing the integration with PHH. An inability to execute on these initiatives may jeopardize our ability to return to profitability and to obtain the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of PHH.\nIf we are unable to respond effectively to routine or other regulatory examinations, our business and financial conditions may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory examinations by state and federal regulators are part of our ordinary course business activities. If we are unable to respond effectively to regulatory examinations, our business and financial conditions may be adversely affected. For example, our January 2015 consent order with the CA DBO, which has now been terminated, arose out of an alleged failure to respond adequately to requests from the CA DBO as part of a routine regulatory examination. If, in the future, we fail to respond effectively to regulatory examinations, we may incur fines or penalties or we could lose the licenses and approvals necessary to engage in our servicing and lending businesses. We could also suffer from reputational harm and become subject to private litigation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly impacted our business and may continue to do so, and new rules and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing rules and regulations by the CFPB could result in increased compliance costs and, potentially, regulatory action against us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and regulation by the CFPB, which the Dodd-Frank Act created, impact our business in the areas of mortgage servicing, loan origination, sales and securitization.\nWe have devoted substantial resources and incurred significant compliance costs responding to the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, including CFPB rules. We expect to continue to do so. If we fail to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, including CFPB rules and subsequent amendments, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on our business activities, private litigation, breaches of our contractual obligations to counterparties (including our debt agreements) and adverse actions by the GSEs or other entities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPrivate legal proceedings and related costs alleging failures to comply with applicable laws or regulatory requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various pending private legal proceedings, including purported class actions, challenging whether certain of our loan servicing practices and other aspects of our business comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements. For\nexample, we are currently a defendant in various matters alleging that (1) certain fees imposed on borrowers relating to payment processing, payment facilitation, or payment convenience violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), (2) we violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by using an automated telephone dialing system to call class members\u2019 cell phones without their consent, (3) we committed securities fraud in connection with certain of our public disclosures, (4) certain fees we assess on borrowers are marked up improperly in violation of applicable state and federal law and (5) the solicitation and marketing to borrowers of certain ancillary products was unfair and deceptive. In the future, we are likely to become subject to other private legal proceedings alleging failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including putative class actions, in the ordinary course of our business. While we do not currently believe that the resolution of the vast majority of the legal proceedings we face will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, we cannot express a view with respect to all of these proceedings. The outcome of any pending legal matter is never certain, and it is possible that adverse results in private legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations. We have paid significant amounts to settle private legal proceedings in recent periods and paid significant amounts in legal and other costs in connection with such proceedings. To the extent we are unable to avoid such costs in future periods, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations could lead to termination of servicing agreements or defaults under our debt agreements.\nMost of our servicing agreements and debt agreements contain provisions requiring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While the specific language in these agreements takes many forms and materiality qualifiers are often present, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be terminated as a servicer and defaults could be triggered under our debt agreements, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows, liquidity, business and financial condition. We could also suffer reputational damage and trustees, lenders and other counterparties could cease wanting to do business with us.\nIf new laws and regulations lengthen foreclosure times or introduce new regulatory requirements regarding foreclosure procedures, our operating costs could increase and we could be subject to regulatory action.\nWhen a mortgage loan is in foreclosure, we are generally required to continue to advance delinquent principal and interest to the securitization trust and to make advances for delinquent taxes and insurance and foreclosure costs and the upkeep of vacant property in foreclosure to the extent that we determine that such amounts are recoverable. These servicing advances are generally recovered when the delinquency is resolved. Regulatory actions that lengthen the foreclosure process will increase the amount of servicing advances that we are required to make, lengthen the time it takes for us to be reimbursed for such advances and increase the costs incurred during the foreclosure process.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny and new laws and procedures could cause us to adopt additional compliance measures and incur additional compliance costs in connection with our foreclosure processes. We may incur legal and other costs responding to regulatory inquiries or any allegation that we improperly foreclosed on a borrower. We could also suffer reputational damage and could be fined or otherwise penalized if we are found to have breached regulatory requirements.\nGSE and Ginnie Mae initiatives and other actions may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the significant role that the GSEs play in the secondary mortgage market, new initiatives and other actions that they may implement could become prevalent in the mortgage servicing industry generally. To the extent that FHFA and/or the GSEs implement reforms that materially affect the market not only for conventional and/or government-insured loans but also the non-qualifying loan markets, such reforms could have a material adverse effect on the creation of new MSRs, the economics or performance of any MSRs that we acquire, servicing fees that we can charge and costs that we incur to comply with new servicing requirements.\nIn addition, our ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of MBS in the secondary market. These entities play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant business relationships with many of them. If it is not possible for us to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in GSE and Ginnie Mae programs, we may lack liquidity to continue to fund mortgage loans and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nOur plans to acquire MSRs will require approvals and cooperation by the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. Should approval or cooperation be withheld, we would have difficulty meeting our MSR acquisition objectives.\nThere are various proposals that deal with the future of the GSEs, including with respect to their ownership and role in the mortgage market, as well as proposals to implement GSE reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs remains uncertain. Any change in the ownership of the GSEs, or in their programs or role within the mortgage market, could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and GSE initiatives in residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, and securitizations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are federal and state legislative and GSE initiatives that could adversely affect our loan origination business and secured asset financing arrangements. For instance, the risk retention requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act require securitization sponsors to retain a portion of the credit risk of the securitized assets, subject to certain exemptions. The risk retention requirement could result in higher costs of certain lending operations and impose on us additional compliance requirements to meet servicing and originations criteria for securitized mortgage loans. Additionally, the amendments to Regulation AB and other regulations applicable asset-backed securities (ABS) adopted by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and other relevant regulations have increased and may further increase compliance costs for ABS issuers, such as ourselves, which will in turn increase our cost of funding and operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected and our plans to expand our lending business could be adversely impacted.\nThe TRID rules include requirements relating to consumer facing disclosure and waiting periods to allow consumers to reconsider committing to loans after receiving required disclosures. If we fail to comply with the TRID rules, we may be unable to sell loans that we originate or purchase, or we may be required to sell such loans at a discount compared to other loans. We also could be subject to repurchase or indemnification claims from purchasers of such loans, including the GSEs. Additionally, loans might stay on our warehouse lines for longer periods before sale, which would increase our holding costs and interest expense. We could also be subject to regulatory actions or private lawsuits.\nIn response to the TRID rules, we have implemented significant modifications and enhancements to our loan production processes and systems, and we continue to devote significant resources to TRID compliance. As regulatory guidance and enforcement and the views of the GSEs and other market participants such as warehouse loan lenders evolve, we may need to modify further our loan production processes and systems in order to adjust to evolution in the regulatory landscape and successfully operate our lending business. In such circumstances, if we are unable to make the necessary adjustments, our business and operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our plans to grow our lending business.\nFailure to comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and related CFPB regulations could adversely impact our business.\nHMDA requires financial institutions to report certain mortgage data in an effort to provide the regulators and the public with information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The data points include information related to the loan applicant/borrower (e.g., age, ethnicity, race and credit score), the underwriting process, loan terms and fees, lender credits and interest rate, among others. The scope of the information available to the public could increase fair lending regulatory scrutiny and third-party plaintiff litigation, as the changes will expand the ability of regulators and third parties to compare a particular lender to its peers in an effort to determine differences among lenders in certain demographic borrower populations. We have devoted, and will need to devote, significant resources to establishing systems and processes for complying with HMDA on an ongoing basis. If we are not successful in capturing and reporting the new HMDA data, and analyzing and correcting any adverse patterns, we could be exposed to regulatory actions and private litigation against us, we could suffer reputational damage and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a participant in the now ended HAMP program, we are subject to review by SIGTARP, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of Ocwen\u2019s loan modifications in recent years have been in connection with the now ended HAMP program. SIGTARP has indicated that it is assessing potential unlawful conduct by servicers in the HAMP program. In May 2017, we received a subpoena from SIGTARP requesting various documents and information relating to Ocwen\u2019s participation in the HAMP program, and we have been providing documents and information in response to that subpoena. If SIGTARP were to allege breaches of the HAMP program, such allegations could be referred to the enforcement authorities within the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Justice and if such enforcement authorities elected to take action against Ocwen, it could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition, regardless of the outcome of any such enforcement action.\nIf we fail to satisfy minimum net worth and liquidity requirements established by regulators, GSEs, Ginnie Mae, lenders, or other counterparties, our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of our servicing and loan origination activities, we are subject to minimum net worth and liquidity requirements established by state regulators, GSEs, Ginnie Mae, lenders, and other counterparties. We have been incurring losses for the last\nfive years, which has eroded our net worth. In addition, we must structure our business so each subsidiary satisfies the net worth and liquidity requirements applicable to it, which can be challenging.\nThe minimum net worth and liquidity requirements to which our licensed entities are subject vary by state and type of license. We must also satisfy the minimum net worth and liquidity requirements of the GSEs and Ginnie Mae in order to maintain our approved status with such agencies and the minimum net worth and liquidity requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders.\nMinimum net worth requirements and liquidity are generally calculated using specific formulas that often exclude various items, such as intangible assets or certain intercompany receivables. Changes to these formulas have the potential to significantly affect net worth and liquidity calculations, and increases to the minimum required thresholds have the potential to cause non-compliance, both of which could imperil our ability to satisfy future minimum net worth and liquidity requirements. We believe our licensed entities were in compliance with all of their minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2018. However, it is possible that regulators could disagree with our calculations, and one state regulator has disagreed with our calculation for a prior year period; we are currently discussing the matter with the regulator.\nIf we fail to satisfy minimum net worth requirements, absent a waiver or other accommodation, we could lose our licenses or have other regulatory action taken against us, we could lose our ability to sell and service loans to or on behalf of the GSEs or Ginnie Mae, or it could trigger a default under our debt agreements. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere may be material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs sponsored by HUD and FHA, and securitized by Ginnie Mae, which could materially and adversely affect us and the reverse mortgage industry as a whole.\nThe reverse mortgage industry is largely dependent upon rules and regulations implemented by HUD, FHA and Ginnie Mae. There can be no guarantee that HUD/FHA will retain Congressional authorization to continue the HECM program, which provides FHA government insurance for qualifying HECM loans, or that they will not make material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs. For example, HUD previously implemented certain lending limits for the HECM program, and added credit-based underwriting criteria designed to assess a borrower\u2019s ability and willingness to satisfy future tax and insurance obligations. In addition, Ginnie Mae\u2019s participation in the reverse mortgage industry may be subject to economic and political changes that cannot be predicted. Any of the aforementioned circumstances could materially and adversely affect the performance of our reverse mortgage business and the value of our common stock.\nRegulators continue to be active in the reverse mortgage space, including due to the perceived susceptibility of older borrowers to be influenced by deceptive or misleading marketing activities. Regulators have also focused on appraisal practices because reverse mortgages are largely dependent on collateral valuation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to the origination of reverse mortgages, we could be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including potential fines, penalties or sanctions, and our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nViolations of predatory lending and/or servicing laws could negatively affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and local laws have been enacted that are designed to discourage predatory lending and servicing practices. The federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in residential loans that have mortgage rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain additional disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than are those in HOEPA. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain residential loans, including loans that are not classified as \u201chigh cost\u201d loans under HOEPA or other applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefits test with respect to the related borrower. A failure by us to comply with these laws, to the extent we originate, service or acquire residential loans that are non-compliant with HOEPA or other predatory lending or servicing laws, could subject us, as an originator or a servicer, or as an assignee, in the case of acquired loans, to monetary penalties and could result in the borrowers rescinding the affected loans. Lawsuits have been brought in various states making claims against originators, servicers and assignees of high cost loans for violations of state law. Named defendants in these cases have included numerous participants within the secondary mortgage market. If we are found to have violated predatory or abusive lending laws, defaults could be declared under our debt or servicing agreements, we could suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with FHA underwriting guidelines could adversely impact our business.\nWe must comply with FHA underwriting guidelines in order to successfully originate FHA loans. If we fail to do so, we may not be able collect on FHA insurance. In addition, we could be subject to allegations of violations of the False Claims Act asserting that we submitted claims for FHA insurance on loans that had not been underwritten in accordance with FHA\nunderwriting guidelines. If we are found to have violated FHA underwriting guidelines, we could face regulatory penalties and damages in litigation, suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses due to an inability to collect on such insurance, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with United States and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a business with a global workforce, we need to ensure that our activities, including those of our foreign subsidiaries, comply with applicable United States and foreign laws and regulations. Various states have implemented regulations which specifically restrict the ability to perform certain servicing and originations functions offshore and, from time to time, various state regulators have scrutinized the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. For example, as previously disclosed, in 2016, two of our foreign subsidiaries entered into a Consent Order with the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions relating to the activities of those entities in Washington State under the Washington Consumer Loan Act. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could, among other things, result in restrictions on our operations, loss of licenses, fines, penalties or reputational damage and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with the S.A.F.E. Act could adversely impact our business.\nThe Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the S.A.F.E. Act) requires the individual licensing and registration of those engaged in the business of loan origination. The S.A.F.E. Act is designed to improve accountability on the part of loan originators, combat fraud and enhance consumer protections by encouraging states to establish a national licensing system and minimum qualification requirements for applicants. Thus, Ocwen must ensure proper licensing for all employees who participate in certain specified loan origination activities. Failure to comply with the S.A.F.E. Act licensing requirements could adversely impact Ocwen\u2019s origination business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that our strategies to return to profitability will be successful.\nWe are facing certain challenges and uncertainties that could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The ability of management to appropriately address these challenges and uncertainties in a timely manner is critical to our ability to operate our business successfully.\nLosses have significantly eroded stockholders\u2019 equity and weakened our financial condition. Our near-term priority is to return to profitability in the shortest timeframe possible within an appropriate risk and compliance environment. While we believe our acquisition of PHH provides us with the opportunity to transform into a stronger, more efficient company better able to serve our customers and clients, and positions us for a return to growth, we believe we must execute on five key initiatives in order to drive stronger financial performance. First, we must successfully execute on the integration of PHH\u2019s business with ours, including a smooth transition onto Black Knight MSP. Second, we must re-engineer our cost structure to go beyond eliminating redundant costs through the integration process. Third, we must fulfill our regulatory commitments and resolve our remaining legal and regulatory matters on satisfactory terms. Fourth, we must replenish our servicing portfolio through expanding our lending business and permissible MSR acquisitions that are prudent and well-executed with appropriate financial return targets. Finally, we must ensure that we continue to manage our balance sheet to provide a solid platform for executing on our growth and other initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing on these initiatives. Further, there can be no assurance that even if we execute on these initiatives we will be able to return to profitability. In addition to successful operational execution of our key initiatives, our success will also depend on market conditions and other factors outside of our control. If we continue to experience losses, our share price, business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet the financing requirements of our business, or if we fail to comply with our debt agreements, our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business requires substantial amounts of capital and our financing strategy includes the use of leverage. Accordingly, our ability to finance our operations and repay maturing obligations rests in large part on our ability to continue to borrow money at reasonable rates. If we are unable to maintain adequate financing, or other sources of capital are not available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our operations, which could harm our revenues, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and business prospects. Our ability to borrow money is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nlimitations imposed on us by existing lending and similar agreements that contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to raise additional debt;\n\u2022\nliquidity in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders from whom we borrow;\n\u2022\nlenders\u2019 perceptions of us or our sector;\n\u2022\ncorporate credit and servicer ratings from rating agencies; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowing under our advance facilities and mortgage loan warehouse facilities due to structural features in these facilities and the amount of eligible collateral that is pledged.\nIn addition, our advance facilities are revolving facilities, and in a typical monthly cycle, we repay up to one-third of the borrowings under these facilities from collections. During the remittance cycle, which starts in the middle of each month, we depend on our lenders to provide the cash necessary to make the advances that we are required to make as servicer. If one or more of these lenders were to restrict our ability to access these revolving facilities or were to fail, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations. We typically require significantly more liquidity to meet our advance funding obligations than our available cash on hand.\nOur advance financing facilities are comprised of (i) revolving notes issued to global financial institutions that generally have a revolving period of less than two years, and (ii) term notes issued to institutional investors with one-, two- and three-year periods. At December 31, 2018, we had $778.3 million outstanding under these facilities. The revolving periods for variable funding notes with a total borrowing capacity of $290.0 million end in 2019.\nIn the event we are unable to renew, replace or extend the revolving period of one or more of these advance financing facilities, repayment of the outstanding balances on the revolving and term notes must begin at the end of the applicable revolving period and end of the term, respectively. In addition, we use mortgage loan warehouse facilities to fund newly originated loans on a short-term basis until they are sold to secondary market investors, including GSEs or other third-party investors. Currently, our master repurchase and participation agreements for financing new loan originations generally have 364-day terms, and similar to the revolving notes in the advance financing facilities, they are typically renewed, replaced or extended annually. At December 31, 2018, we had $155.7 million outstanding under these warehouse financing arrangements, all under agreements maturing in 2019.\nWe currently plan to renew, replace or extend all these debt agreements consistent with our historical experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, replace or extend all our debt agreements on appropriate terms or at all and, if we fail to do so, we may not have adequate sources of funding for our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various qualitative and quantitative covenants, including financial covenants, covenants to operate in material compliance with applicable laws, monitoring and reporting obligations and restrictions on our ability to engage in various activities, including but not limited to incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing or redeeming capital stock, transferring assets or making loans, investments or acquisitions. As a result of the covenants to which we are subject, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and may be limited in our ability to engage in favorable business activities or raise additional capital to finance future operations or satisfy future liquidity needs. In addition, breaches or events that may result in a default under our debt agreements include, among other things, noncompliance with our covenants, nonpayment of principal or interest, material misrepresentations, the occurrence of a material adverse effect or change, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain material judgments and changes of control. Covenants and defaults of this type are commonly found in debt agreements such as ours. Certain of these covenants and defaults are open to subjective interpretation and, if our interpretation were contested by a lender, a court may ultimately be required to determine compliance or lack thereof. In addition, our debt agreements generally include cross default provisions such that a default under one agreement could trigger defaults under other agreements. If we fail to comply with our debt agreements and are unable to avoid, remedy or secure a waiver of any resulting default, we may be subject to adverse action by our lenders, including termination of further funding, acceleration of outstanding obligations, enforcement of liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting our obligations and other legal remedies.\nAn actual or alleged default under any of our debt agreements, negative ratings action by a rating agency, the perception of financial weakness, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or GSE, a lengthening of foreclosure timelines or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and make it difficult for us to renew existing credit facilities or obtain new lines of credit. Any or all the above could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient servicer advance financing necessary to meet the financing requirements of our business, which could adversely affect our liquidity position and result in a loss of servicing rights.\nWe currently fund a substantial portion of our servicing advance obligations through our servicing advance facilities. Under normal market conditions, mortgage servicers typically have been able to renew or refinance these facilities. However, market conditions or lenders\u2019 perceptions of us at the time of any renewal or refinancing may mean that we are unable to renew or refinance our advance financing facilities or obtain additional facilities on favorable terms or at all.\nOur servicing business is highly dependent on our continued relationship with NRZ, our largest client. NRZ-related servicing constituted approximately 51% of the Ocwen servicing portfolio by UPB as of December 31, 2018. Our agreements\nwith NRZ provide NRZ with certain termination and transfer rights. Should NRZ choose to exercise these rights, we could be materially and adversely impacted due to the large proportion of our servicing portfolio to which these rights apply.\nUnder agreements relating to subservicing and Rights to MSRs for loans with approximately $130.5 billion in outstanding UPB as of December 31, 2018 (representing 51% of the Ocwen servicing portfolio), any failure under a financial covenant could result in NRZ terminating Ocwen as subservicer under the subservicing agreements or in directing the transfer of servicing away from Ocwen under the Rights to MSRs agreements. Similarly, failure by Ocwen to meet operational requirements, including service levels, critical reporting and other obligations, could also result in termination or transfer for cause. A termination for cause and transfer of servicing could materially and adversely affect Ocwen\u2019s financial condition and share value.\nFurther, under our 2017 subservicing agreement with NRZ, at any time during the initial five-year term, NRZ may terminate these agreements for convenience, subject to Ocwen\u2019s right to receive a termination fee and proper notice. In addition, under the 2018 agreements relating to NRZ\u2019s Rights to MSRs, NRZ has the right to sell its servicing rights to a third-party if third-party consents to transfer the MSRs to NRZ are not obtained and Ocwen does not elect to purchase NRZ\u2019s servicing rights. If NRZ sells its servicing rights to a third party, the transaction can only be completed if the third-party buyer can obtain the necessary third-party consents to transfer the MSRs. NRZ also has the obligation to use reasonable efforts to encourage such third-party buyer to enter into a subservicing agreement with Ocwen. Ocwen may lose future compensation for subservicing, however, if no subservicing agreement is ultimately entered into with the third-party buyer.\nPHH also has a substantial relationship with NRZ that we assumed as a result of the PHH acquisition. As part of the sale of substantially all of PHH\u2019s MSRs and related servicing advances to NRZ, PHH entered into a subservicing agreement with NRZ for the subservicing of the loans to which the MSRs relate for an initial three-year period beginning June 2017, subject to certain transfer and termination provisions. The loans subject to the subservicing agreement represent $42.3 billion in UPB as of December 31, 2018. NRZ has the ability to terminate portions of the subservicing agreement over the three-year term, beginning with the ability to terminate with respect to 25% of the loans covered thereby in June 2018 and 25% beginning in June 2019. If NRZ terminates this relationship, in full or in part, it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue. In addition, the sale transaction has not been completed with respect to loans representing $3.4 billion in UPB and $73.3 million of servicing advances as of December 31, 2018. There is a risk that the sale of these remaining assets may not be completed, in which case we would not receive the sale proceeds.\nBecause of the large percentage of our servicing business that is represented by agreements with NRZ that provide NRZ with the termination or transfer rights described above, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if NRZ exercised a significant portion of these rights. More generally, if NRZ were to decline to continue doing business with us and we were unable to develop relationships with new servicing clients on a similar scale, our servicing business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf NRZ were to fail to comply with its servicing advance obligations under its agreements with us, it could materially and adversely affect us.\nUnder the Rights to MSRs agreements, NRZ is responsible for financing all servicing advance obligations in connection with the loans underlying the MSRs. At December 31, 2018, such servicing advances were approximately $2.3 billion. However, under the Rights to MSRs structure, we are contractually required under our servicing agreements with the RMBS trusts to make the relevant servicing advances even if NRZ does not perform its contractual obligations to fund those advances. Therefore, if NRZ were unable to meet its advance financing obligations, we would remain obligated to meet our advance financing obligations with respect to the loans underlying these Rights to MSRs, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and servicing operations.\nNRZ currently uses advance financing facilities to fund a substantial portion of the servicing advances that NRZ is contractually obligated to make pursuant the Rights to MSRs agreements. Although we are not an obligor or guarantor under NRZ\u2019s advance financing facilities, we are a party to certain of the facility documents as the entity performing the work of servicing the underlying loans on which advances are being financed. As such, we make certain representations, warranties and covenants, including representations and warranties in connection with our sale of advances to NRZ. If we were to make representations or warranties that were untrue or if we were otherwise to fail to comply with our contractual obligations, we could become subject to claims for damages or events of default under such facilities could be asserted.\nA failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nS&P, Moody\u2019s, Fitch and others rate us as a mortgage servicer. Failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell or fund servicing advances going forward, could affect the terms and availability of debt financing facilities that we may seek in the future, and could impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions or adversely affect our dealings with lenders, other contractual counterparties and regulators, including our ability to maintain our\nstatus as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The servicer rating requirements of Fannie Mae do not necessarily require or imply immediate action, as Fannie Mae has discretion with respect to whether we are in compliance with their requirements and what actions it deems appropriate under the circumstances in the event that we fall below their desired servicer ratings.\nCertain of our servicing agreements require that we maintain specified servicer ratings. Out of 3,140 non-Agency servicing agreements, 697 with $25.9 billion of UPB as of December 31, 2018 have minimum servicer ratings criteria. As a result of our current servicer ratings, termination rights have been triggered in 171 of these non-Agency servicing agreements. This represents approximately $8.2 billion in UPB as of December 31, 2018, or approximately 7% of our total non-Agency servicing portfolio. While the holders of these termination rights have not exercised them to date, they have not waived the right to do so, and we could, in the future, be subject to terminations either as a result of servicer ratings downgrades or future adverse actions by ratings agencies, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations. Downgrades in our servicer ratings could also affect the terms and availability of advance financing facilities that we may seek in the future. Our failure to maintain minimum or specified ratings could adversely affect our dealings with contractual counterparties, including GSEs, and regulators, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic slowdown or a deterioration of the housing market could increase both interest expense on servicing advances and operating expenses and could cause a reduction in income from, and the value of, our servicing portfolio.\nDuring any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums and process foreclosures. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors. Most of our advances have the highest standing and are \u201ctop of the waterfall\u201d so that we are entitled to repayment from respective loan or REO liquidations proceeds before most other claims on these proceeds, and in the majority of cases, advances in excess of respective loan or REO liquidation proceeds may be recovered from pool level proceeds. Consequently, the primary impact of an increase in advances is through increased interest expense as we finance a large portion of servicing advance obligations.\nHigher delinquencies also increase our cost to service loans, as loans in default require more intensive effort to bring them current or manage the foreclosure process. An increase in delinquencies may delay the timing of revenue recognition because we recognize servicing fees as earned, which is generally upon collection of payments from borrowers or proceeds from REO liquidations. An increase in delinquencies also generally leads to lower balances in custodial and escrow accounts (float balances) and lower net earnings on custodial and escrow accounts (float earnings). Additionally, an increase in delinquencies in our GSE servicing portfolio will result in lower revenue because we collect servicing fees from GSEs only on performing loans.\nForeclosures are involuntary prepayments resulting in a reduction in UPB. This may result in higher amortization expense as well as charges to recognize impairment and declines in the value of our MSRs.\nAdverse economic conditions could also negatively impact our lending businesses. For example, declining home prices and increasing loan-to-value ratios may preclude many potential borrowers from refinancing their existing loans. Further, an increase in prevailing interest rates could decrease originations volume.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant increase in prepayment speeds could adversely affect our financial results.\nPrepayment speed is a significant driver of our business. Prepayment speed is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down the UPB of their loans or how quickly loans are otherwise brought current, modified, liquidated or charged off. Prepayment speeds have a significant impact on our servicing fee revenues, our expenses and on the valuation of our MSRs as follows:\n\u2022\nRevenue. If prepayment speeds increase, our servicing fees will decline more rapidly than anticipated because of the greater decrease in the UPB on which those fees are based. The reduction in servicing fees would be somewhat offset by increased float earnings because the faster repayment of loans will result in higher float balances that generate the float earnings. Conversely, decreases in prepayment speeds result in increased servicing fees but lead to lower float balances and float earnings.\n\u2022\nExpenses. Amortization of MSRs is one of our largest operating expenses. Since we amortize servicing rights in proportion to total expected income over the life of a portfolio, an increase in prepayment speeds leads to increased amortization expense as we revise downward our estimate of total expected income. Faster prepayment speeds also result in higher compensating interest expense, which represents the difference between the full month of interest we are required to remit in the month a loan pays off and the amount of interest we collect from the borrower for that\nmonth. Decreases in prepayment speeds lead to decreased amortization expense as the period over which we amortize MSRs is extended. Slower prepayment speeds also lead to lower compensating interest expense.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. We base the price we pay for MSRs and the rate of amortization of those rights on, among other things, our projection of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of prepayment speeds is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If prepayment speeds were significantly greater than expected, the fair value of our MSRs, which we carry at fair value, could decrease. When the fair value of these MSRs decreases, we record a loss on fair value, which also has a negative impact on our financial results. Effective January 1, 2018, we elected fair value accounting for our MSRs previously accounted for using the amortization method.\nIf we do not comply with our obligations under our servicing agreements or if others allege non-compliance, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have contractual obligations under the servicing agreements pursuant to which we service mortgage loans. Many of our servicing agreements require adherence to general servicing standards, and certain contractual provisions delegate judgment over various servicing matters to us. Our servicing practices, and the judgments that we make in our servicing of loans, could be questioned by parties to these agreements, such as trustees or master servicers, or by investors in the trusts which own the mortgage loans (or other third parties). As a result, we could become subject to litigation claims seeking damages or other remedies arising from alleged breaches of our servicing agreements. Indeed, several trustees are currently defending themselves against claims by RMBS investors that the trustees failed to properly oversee mortgage servicers-including Ocwen-in the servicing of hundreds of trusts. Trustees subject to those suits have informed Ocwen that they may seek indemnification for losses they suffer as a result of the filings.\nIf we do not comply with our servicing agreements, we may be terminated as servicer, or we may be required to make indemnification or other payments or provide other remedies. Such actions may have a significant negative impact on our profitability and lead to lower earnings in the future. Even if such allegations against us lack merit, we may have to spend additional resources and devote additional management time to contesting such allegations, which would reduce the resources available to address, and the time management is able to devote to, other issues.\nIn addition, OLS, Homeward, Liberty and PMC are parties to seller/servicer agreements and/or subject to guidelines and regulations (collectively, seller/servicer obligations) with one or more of the GSEs, HUD, FHA, VA and Ginnie Mae. These seller/servicer obligations include financial covenants that include capital requirements related to tangible net worth, as defined by the applicable agency, an obligation to provide audited consolidated financial statements within 90 days of the applicable entity\u2019s fiscal year end as well as extensive requirements regarding servicing, selling and other matters. To the extent that these requirements are not met or waived, the applicable agency may, at its option, utilize a variety of remedies including requirements to provide certain information or take actions at the direction of the applicable agency, requirements to deposit funds as security for our obligations, sanctions, suspension or even termination of approved seller/servicer status, which would prohibit future originations or securitizations of forward or reverse mortgage loans or servicing for the applicable agency. To date, none of these agencies has communicated any material sanction, suspension or prohibition in connection with our seller/servicer obligations. We believe we were in compliance with the related net worth requirements at December 31, 2018. Our non-Agency servicing agreements also contain requirements regarding servicing practices and other matters, and a failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. See Note 25 - Contingencies for additional information relating to our recent interactions with Ginnie Mae as a result of the state regulatory actions discussed in that note.\nGSEs or Ginnie Mae may curtail or terminate our ability to sell, service or securitize newly originated loans to them.\nAs noted in the prior risk factor, if we do not comply with our seller/servicer obligations, the GSEs or Ginnie Mae may utilize a variety of remedies against us. Such remedies include curtailment of our ability to sell newly originated loans or even termination of our ability to sell, service or securitize such loans altogether.\nTechnology or process failures could damage our business operations or reputation, harm our relationships with key stakeholders and lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.\nOperational risk is inherent in virtually all of our activities. While we have established and maintain an overall risk framework that is designed to balance strong corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management, we continue to be subject to some degree of operational risk. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which are complex, across various parts of our business. These transactions often must adhere to the terms of a complex set of legal and regulatory standards, as well as the terms of our servicing and other agreements. In addition, given the volume of transactions that we process and monitor, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. For example, in the area of borrower correspondence, in 2014, problems were identified with our letter dating processes such that erroneously dated letters were sent to borrowers, which damaged our reputation and relationships with borrowers, regulators, important counterparties and other stakeholders. Because in an average\nmonth we mail over 2 million letters, a process problem such as erroneous letter dating has the potential to negatively affect many parts of our business and have widespread negative implications.\nWe are responsible for developing and maintaining sophisticated operational systems and infrastructure, which is challenging. The CFPB and other regulators have emphasized their focus on the importance of servicers\u2019 and lenders\u2019 systems and infrastructure operating effectively. If our systems and infrastructure fail to operate effectively, such failures could damage our business and reputation, harm our relationships with key stakeholders and lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.\nWe are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either because of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems, including, without limitation, by means of cyberattack or denial-of-service attack. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nCertain of our operational systems and infrastructure are provided by third-party vendors. If any of these vendors fail to provide us with effective operational systems and infrastructure or appropriate levels of service, we could also be required to take legal action against or replace such vendors, which could be costly, involve a diversion of management time and energy and lead to operational disruptions.\nWe are dependent on Altisource and other vendors for much of our technology and other services.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks. We have significant exposure to third-party risks, as we are dependent on vendors for a number of key services, including our servicing system that runs on an information technology system that we license under agreements with Altisource. Our servicing business operates on this system and we have used it for many years. In 2017, we entered into an agreement with Black Knight pursuant to which we plan to transition to Black Knight MSP during 2019. On February 22, 2019, Ocwen and Altisource S.\u00e0 r.l (a subsidiary of Altisource) signed a Binding Term Sheet (the Term Sheet), which among other things, confirms Altisource\u2019s cooperation with the de-boarding of loans from Altisource\u2019s REALServicing servicing system to Black Knight\u2019s MSP servicing system.\nIn addition to the Term Sheet, Ocwen and Altisource S.\u00e0 r.l also entered into a letter agreement confirming that, except in relation to Ocwen\u2019s transfer off of the REALServicing technology beginning in February 2019 or termination of the REALServicing statement of work, each party reserves its rights and remedies in the event of any disputes between them. While the Term Sheet does not restrict Ocwen\u2019s rights to sell MSRs in any way, the letter agreement specifically includes a reservation of each party\u2019s rights to assert damage claims against the other party regarding such transactions including any transfer by Ocwen to NRZ (or its affiliates) or any third party of the rights to designate a vendor. Ocwen does not believe its agreements with Altisource restrict Ocwen\u2019s rights to sell MSRs or to restrict Ocwen from allowing an owner of MSRs, or owner of the economics thereto, the right to designate vendors. As such, Ocwen believes any asserted claims by Altisource against Ocwen arising from Ocwen\u2019s sale of MSRs or related to the rights to designate a vendor to a third party, would be without merit and we have so informed Altisource. However, if Altisource were to assert such claims against us, such disputes could cause us to incur costs, divert the attention of management, and potentially disrupt our operations which rely on Altisource-provided services, regardless of whether such claims were ultimately resolved in our favor.\nIf Altisource were to fail to properly fulfill its contractual obligations to us, including through a failure to provide services at the required level to maintain and support our systems, or if Altisource were to become unable to fulfill such obligations, our business and operations would suffer. In addition, if Altisource fails to develop and maintain its technology so as to provide us with an effective and competitive platform, our business could suffer. Similarly, we are reliant on other vendors for the proper maintenance and support of our technological systems and our business and operations would suffer if these vendors do not perform as required. If Altisource or our other vendors do not adequately maintain and support our systems, including our servicing systems, loan originations and financial reporting systems, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAltisource and other vendors supply us with other services in connection with our business activities such as property preservation and inspection services and valuation services. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the applicable servicing criteria, we could be exposed to liability as the servicer and it could negatively impact our relationships with our servicing clients, borrowers or regulators, among others. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to our reliance on the vendors discussed above, our business is reliant on a number of technological vendors that provide services such as integrated cloud applications and financial institutions that provide essential banking services on a\ndaily basis. Even short-terms interruptions in the services provided by these vendors and financial institutions could be disruptive to our business and cause us financial loss. Significant or prolonged disruptions in the ability of these companies to provide services to us could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have undergone and continue to undergo significant change to our technology infrastructure and business processes. Failure to adequately update our systems and processes could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, technology investments and process improvements to improve or replace the information processes and systems that are key to managing our business, to improve our compliance management system, and to reduce costs. Additionally, as part of the transition to Black Knight MSP and the integration of our information processes and systems with PHH, we have undergone and continue to undergo significant changes to our technology infrastructure and business processes. Failure to select the appropriate technology investments, or to implement them correctly and efficiently, could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nIf our transition to a new servicing system does not go as planned, we could experience disruptions in our operations, and our relationships with regulators and our regulatory compliance could be negatively impacted.\nAs described above, we have entered into an agreement with Black Knight pursuant to which we plan to transition to Black Knight MSP during 2019. We are highly dependent on the successful functioning of our servicing system in order to operate our loan servicing business effectively and in compliance with our regulatory and contractual obligations. Implementing a large-scale transition to a new technology product such as a new servicing system is inherently complex and involves significant operational risk, including with respect to technical deficiencies that may impact customer data. We expect to devote significant capital and human resources to implementing this transition, and we may experience decreases in productivity and increased costs as our employees implement and become familiar with the new system. Further, both the costs and length of time required to implement the transition may exceed our expectations. Because PHH currently utilizes Black Knight MSP for its servicing operations, Ocwen intends to transfer the loans it services to PHH\u2019s Black Knight MSP versus a separate instance of Black Knight MSP as it believes such a transfer can happen sooner and with less implementation and transfer risk. While we believe that such a transition poses less risk, it will still be subject to the operational and other risks summarized above. Accordingly, if our transition to Black Knight MSP does not go as planned, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, delays or other issues with our transition to Black Knight MSP could negatively impact our relationships with regulators and our regulatory compliance.\nDisagreements with vendors, service providers or other contractual counterparties could materially and adversely affect our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on Altisource and other vendors and service providers for much of our technology and other services and on banks, NRZ and other financing sources to finance our business. Certain provisions of the agreements underlying our relationships with our vendors, service providers, financing sources and other contractual counterparties could be open to subjective interpretation. Disagreements with these counterparties, including disagreements over contract interpretation, could lead to business disruptions or could result in litigation or arbitration or mediation proceedings, any of which could be expensive and divert senior management\u2019s attention from other matters. While we have been able to resolve disagreements with these counterparties in the past, if we were unable to resolve a disagreement, a court, arbitrator or mediator might be required to resolve the matter and there can be no assurance that the outcome of a material disagreement with a contractual counterparty would not materially and adversely affect our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nLoan putbacks and related liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties regarding sold loans could adversely affect our business.\nWe have exposure to representation, warranty and indemnification obligations because of our lending, sales and securitization activities, and in certain instances, we have assumed these obligations on loans we service. Our contracts with purchasers of originated loans contain provisions that require indemnification or repurchase of the related loans under certain circumstances. While the language in the purchase contracts varies, such contracts generally contain provisions that require us to indemnify purchasers of its loans or repurchase such loans if:\n\u2022\nrepresentations and warranties concerning loan quality, contents of the loan file or loan underwriting circumstances are inaccurate;\n\u2022\nadequate mortgage insurance is not secured within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage; or\n\u2022\nthere is a failure to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, in one of the servicing contracts that Homeward acquired in 2008 from Freddie Mac involving non-prime mortgage loans, it assumed the origination representations and warranties even though it did not originate the loans.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding representation and warranty repurchase demands of $51.3 million UPB (316 loans).\nWe believe that, because of the current market environment, many purchasers of residential mortgage loans are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify or repurchase loans and under which such purchasers would benefit from enforcing any indemnification rights and repurchase remedies they may have.\nIf home values decrease, our realized loan losses from loan repurchases and indemnifications may increase as well. As a result, our liability for repurchases may increase beyond our current expectations. Depending on the magnitude of any such increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLiabilities relating to our past sales of Agency MSRs could adversely affect our business.\nWe have made representations, warranties and covenants relating to our past sales of Agency MSRs. In addition, PHH has also conducted past sales of Agency MSRs, including the sales of its Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MSRs to NRZ, and we acquired these contractual liabilities in connection with our acquisition of PHH. To the extent that we (or PHH, as applicable) have made inaccurate representations or warranties or fail to perform our covenants, we could incur liability to the purchasers of these MSRs pursuant to the contractual provisions of our sale agreements. In addition, transfers of servicing are subject to regulation under federal consumer finance laws, including CFPB rules implementing RESPA that require servicers to, among other things, maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to facilitate the transfer of accurate information and documents during mortgage servicing transfers and properly evaluate loss mitigation applications that are in process at the time of transfer. The CFPB has advised mortgage servicers that its examiners will be carefully reviewing servicers\u2019 compliance with these and other regulations applicable to servicing transfers, and state mortgage regulators have supervisory power over any licensed institutions involved in a transaction. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to our compliance efforts and to engaging with such regulators in connection with our transfers of mortgage servicing, and we expect to continue to do so. If we fail to comply with regulations relating to servicing transfers in connection with dispositions of MSRs, we could be subject to adverse regulatory actions, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are highly dependent on an experienced senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the loss of the services of one or more of our senior officers could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, high turnover of management and non-management employees could harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on an experienced management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance relating to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Glen A. Messina, or any of our other executive officers. The loss of the services of Mr. Messina or any of our other senior officers could have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be harmed by legal actions brought by former senior officers after they have ceased employment with Ocwen.\nIn 2018, we experienced elevated management turnover, including the departure of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald M. Faris, and our former Chief Financial Officer, Michael R. Bourque, Jr. In addition, as we integrate business units following the PHH acquisition, we are experiencing significant turnover among both management and non-management employees. While planned departures form part of our plan to capture acquisition synergies, there is a risk that employee departures, even if planned, could lead to operational disruptions or other adverse impacts on our business. If we are unable to retain key talent as we execute the integration, it could impair our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of the PHH acquisition.\nThe human capital and site closure components of our cost re-engineering efforts could disrupt operations, impair morale and productivity, and generate negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial performance.\nAs part of our cost re-engineering plans, we expect to reduce total staffing levels significantly and to close a number of our U.S. facilities. While we believe these steps are necessary in order to drive stronger financial performance and, in the longer term, simplify our operations, the process of closing these facilities will add complexity to our operations in the short term and divert management and employee attention from our other initiatives. In addition, the reduction in our workforce may negatively impact employee morale. It is possible that critical employees may seek other employment, or that employees needed to assist with the transition will depart prior to their scheduled departure dates. Further, it is possible that we have misjudged the number or allocation of positions needed to run our operations efficiently and critical functions could be understaffed. Finally, the potential negative publicity accompanying the site closures and workforce reductions may invite increased regulatory inquiries. Any of the above risks, or a combination of these risks, could impair our ability to realize anticipated integration synergies and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also depends, in part, on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled servicing, lending, finance, risk, compliance and technical personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous financial services and other companies, some of which have far greater resources and better reputations than we do. We may be\nunable to identify, attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we were to be unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruptions resulting from severe weather events.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruptions resulting from severe weather events, including our operations in India, the Philippines, the USVI and Florida. Approximately 4,100, or 57%, of our employees as of December 31, 2018 are located in India. During 2017 and 2018, severe flooding caused disruptions to our operations in both India and the Philippines, and we remain vulnerable to future events of flooding and severe weather. In addition, OLS and OMS maintain their headquarters in St. Croix, in the USVI, where we also operate a call center. During 2017, two major hurricanes disrupted our operations in St. Croix for an extended period of time and we faced additional expense resulting from the evacuation of personnel and from property damage. Further, weather-related damage in St. Croix has made living there more burdensome, which could negatively impact our ability to retain and attract qualified personnel. The occurrence of severe weather events in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to, among other things, requirements regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If our internal controls over financial reporting are found to be inadequate, our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. As previously disclosed, in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as a result of which we determined our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. In response to changes implemented by management, and subsequent testing and evaluation, we consider this material weakness to be remediated and have concluded that these controls are operating effectively. However, we cannot be certain that any measures that we implemented will ensure adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Even if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), because of their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Fraud or misstatement could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, investors could lose confidence in our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected if our internal controls over financial reporting are found by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm not to be adequate.\nWe have operations in India and the Philippines that could be adversely affected by changes in the political or economic stability of these countries or by government policies in India, the Philippines or the U.S.\nApproximately 4,100, or 57%, of our employees as of December 31, 2018 are located in India. A significant change in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. The political or regulatory climate in the U.S. or elsewhere also could change so that it would not be lawful or practical for us to use international operations in the manner in which we currently use them. For example, changes in regulatory requirements could require us to curtail our use of lower-cost operations in India to service our businesses. If we had to curtail or cease our operations in India and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we could incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent in India. Unless we can continue to enhance the efficiency and productivity of our employees, wage increases in the long term may negatively impact our financial performance.\nPolitical activity or other changes in the political or economic stability in India could affect our ability to operate our business effectively. For example, political protests disrupted our Indian operations in multiple cities for a number of days during 2018. Depending on the frequency and intensity of similar occurrences in the future, our Indian operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nOur operations in the Philippines are less substantial than our operations in India. However, they are still at risk of being affected by the same types of risks that affect our Indian operations. If they were to be so affected, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are a number of foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations in India and the Philippines, including laws and regulations that govern licensing, employment, safety, taxes and insurance and laws and regulations that\ngovern the creation, continuation and winding up of companies as well as the relationships between shareholders, our corporate entities, the public and the government in these countries. Non-compliance with the laws and regulations of India or the Philippines could result in (i) restrictions on our operations in these countries, (ii) fines, penalties or sanctions or (iii) reputational damage.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and, to the extent we fail to meet these competitive challenges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory or technological changes. Competition to service mortgage loans and for mortgage loan originations comes primarily from commercial banks and savings institutions and non-bank lenders and mortgage servicers. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and typically have access to greater financial resources and lower funding costs. While our acquisition of PHH is anticipated to help us increase scale and utilize resources more efficiently, we continue to face competitive disadvantages. Further, our competitors that are national banks may also benefit from a federal exemption from certain state regulatory requirements that is applicable to depository institutions. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of revenue generating options (e.g., originating types of loans that we choose not to originate) and establish more favorable relationships than we can. With the proliferation of smartphones and technological changes enabling improved payment systems and cheaper data storage, newer market participants, often called \u201cdisruptors,\u201d are reinventing aspects of the financial industry and capturing profit pools previously enjoyed by existing market participants. As a result, the lending industry could become even more competitive if new market participants are successful in capturing market share from existing market participants such as ourselves. Competition to service residential loans may result in lower margins. Because of the relatively limited number of servicing clients, our failure to meet the expectations of any significant client could materially impact our business. Ocwen has suffered reputational damage as a result of our regulatory settlements and the associated scrutiny of our business. We believe this may have weakened our competitive position against both our bank and non-bank mortgage servicing competitors. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe originate and securitize reverse mortgages, which subjects us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe originate, securitize and service reverse mortgages although we have retained third parties to subservice the reverse mortgages. The reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. Generally, a reverse mortgage is a loan available to seniors aged 62 or older that allows homeowners to borrow money against the value of their home. No repayment of the mortgage is required until a default event under the terms of the mortgage occurs, the borrower dies, the borrower moves out of the home or the home is sold. A decline in the demand for reverse mortgages may reduce the number of reverse mortgages we originate and adversely affect our ability to sell reverse mortgages in the secondary market. Although foreclosures involving reverse mortgages generally occur less frequently than forward mortgages, loan defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to occupy the home as their primary residence, maintain their property or fail to pay taxes or home insurance premiums. A general increase in foreclosure rates may adversely impact how reverse mortgages are perceived by potential customers and thus reduce demand for reverse mortgages. Additionally, we could become subject to negative headline risk in the event that loan defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or evictions of the elderly. The HUD HECM reverse mortgage program has in the past responded to scrutiny around similar issues by implementing rule changes, and may do so in the future. It is not possible to predict whether any such rule changes would negatively impact us. All of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to fund our tail commitments or securitize our HECM loans (including tails), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have originated and continue to service HECM loans under which the borrower has additional undrawn borrowing capacity in the form of undrawn lines of credit. We are obligated to fund future borrowings drawn on that capacity. As of December 31, 2018, our commitment to fund additional borrowing capacity was $1.4 billion. In addition, we are required to pay mortgage insurance premiums on behalf of HECM borrowers. We normally fund these obligations on a short-term basis using our cash resources, and from time to time securitize these amounts (along with our servicing fees) through the issuance of tails. If our cash resources are insufficient to fund these amounts and we are unable to fund them through the securitization of such tails, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nReinsuring risk through our captive reinsurance entity could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nIf our captive reinsurance entity incurs losses from a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes, particularly in areas where a significant portion of the insured properties are located, claims that result could substantially exceed our expectations, which could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business is in the states of California, Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, and our business may be significantly harmed by a slowdown in the economy or the occurrence of a natural disaster in those states.\nA significant portion of the mortgage loans that we service and originate are secured by properties in California, Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois. Any adverse economic conditions in these markets, including a downturn in real estate values, could increase loan delinquencies. Delinquent loans are more costly to service and require us to advance delinquent principal and interest and to make advances for delinquent taxes and insurance and foreclosure costs and the upkeep of vacant property in foreclosure to the extent that we determine that such amounts are recoverable. We could also be adversely affected by business disruptions triggered by natural disasters or acts or war or terrorism in these geographic areas.\nWe may incur litigation costs and related losses if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or if a court overturns a foreclosure.\nWe may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to a title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. A significant increase in litigation costs could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for servicing advances could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur earnings may be subject to volatility.\nOur operating results have been and may in the future be significantly affected by inter-period variations in our results of operations, including variations due to expense fluctuations, sales or acquisitions of MSRs or changes in the value of MSRs due to, among other factors, increases or decreases in prepayment speeds, delinquencies or defaults.\nCertain non-recurring gains and losses have significantly affected our operating results in the past, and non-recurring gains and losses may affect our operating results in future periods, resulting in substantial inter-period variations in financial performance. In particular, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect substantial costs relating to the integration of PHH, including costs relating to severance agreements and technology transitions. These costs may continue to have a significant impact on our future financial results.\nWe use estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets or write up the value of these liabilities, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur ability to measure and report our financial position and operating results is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events based on information available at the time of the financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires that management make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows.\nFair value is estimated based on a hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels whereby the highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs and the lowest to Level 3 inputs.\nAt December 31, 2018, 77% and 73% of our consolidated total assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, respectively, on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, 97% and 100% of which are considered Level 3 valuations. Our largest Level 3 asset and liability carried at fair value on a recurring basis is Loans held for investment - reverse mortgages and the related secured financing. We pool home equity conversion mortgages (reverse mortgages) into Ginnie Mae Home Equity Conversion Mortgage-Backed Securities (HMBS). Because the transfers of reverse mortgages do not qualify for sale accounting, we account for these transfers as secured financings and classify the transferred reverse mortgages as Loans held\nfor investment - reverse mortgages and recognize the related Financing liabilities. Holders of HMBS have no recourse against our assets, except for standard representations and warranties and our contractual obligations to service the reverse mortgages and HMBS.\nWe estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities utilizing assumptions that we believe are appropriate and are used by market participants. The methodology used to estimate these values is complex and uses asset- and liability-specific data and market inputs for assumptions including interest and discount rates, collateral status and expected future performance and liquidity dates. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain of our assets may decrease, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through negative impacts on our ability to satisfy minimum net worth and liquidity covenants.\nValuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated, delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated or financial market illiquidity is greater than anticipated, we may be required to adjust the value of certain assets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have interest rate caps in place that limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on our match funded advance financing facilities. We currently have no economic hedge positions open to hedge our fair value MSRs. If we acquire additional servicing or subservicing rights in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the fixed rate financing that would be necessary to protect us from the effect of rising interest rates. Therefore, we may consider utilizing various derivative financial instruments to protect against the effects of rising rates. In addition, we may use interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury futures, forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure on loans and MSRs measured at fair value. We have entered into forward mortgage backed securities trades to hedge our mortgage loans held for sale at fair value and to hedge interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on loans that we have agreed to originate at a specified fixed or variable rate.\nNevertheless, no hedging strategy can completely protect us. The derivative financial instruments that we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risks. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot be assured that our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in or magnify losses.\nWe are exposed to liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks among other risks.\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support our servicing business including the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts. We are also exposed to liquidity risk by our decision to originate and finance mortgage loans and sell mortgage loans into the secondary market. In general, we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources of funding, including match funded borrowing agreements, secured lines of credit and repurchase agreements. We believe that we will have adequate financing for the next twelve months.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds, or on different bases, than our interest earning assets or when financed assets are not interest-bearing. Our servicing business is characterized by non-interest earning assets financed by interest-bearing liabilities. Among the more significant non-interest earning assets are servicing advances and MSRs. At December 31, 2018, we had total advances and match funded advances of $1.2 billion. We are also exposed to interest rate risk because a portion of our advance financing and other outstanding debt at December 31, 2018 is variable rate. Rising interest rates may increase our interest expense. Earnings on float balances partially offset this variability. At December 31, 2018, we had no interest rate swaps in place to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates, but we have interest rate caps in place as required by certain of our advance financing arrangements.\nThe MSRs that we carry at fair value are subject to substantial interest rate risk as the mortgage loans underlying the servicing rights permit the borrowers to prepay the loans. We may enter into economic hedges (derivatives that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes) including interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury futures and forward contracts to minimize the effects of loss in value of these MSRs associated with increased prepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates. We currently have no economic hedges in place to minimize the effects on our MSRs carried at fair value of increased prepayment activity in the event of declining interest rates.\nIn our lending business, we are subject to interest rate and price risk on mortgage loans held for sale from the loan funding date until the date the loan is sold into the secondary market. Generally, the fair value of a loan will decline in value when interest rates increase and will rise in value when interest rates decrease. To mitigate this risk, we enter into forward mortgage-backed securities trades to provide an economic hedge against those changes in fair value on mortgage loans held for sale. IRLCs represent an agreement to purchase loans from a third-party originator or an agreement to extend credit to a mortgage\napplicant, whereby the interest rate is set prior to funding. As such, outstanding IRLCs are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the commitment through the loan funding date or expiration date. Our interest rate exposure on these derivative loan commitments is hedged with freestanding derivatives such as forward contracts. We also enter into forward contracts with respect to fixed or variable rate loan commitments.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non-U.S. dollar currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged. Our operations in the Philippines and India expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the risks described above and other risks to which we are subject. See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management. However, we cannot guarantee that our risk management policies and procedures will be effective, and to the extent they are not, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPursuit of business or asset acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us.\nThis risk factor discusses certain general risks raised by acquisitions. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Integration of PHH\u201d below for a discussion of certain specific risks relating to our 2018 acquisition of PHH.\nWe are actively looking for opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions of businesses and assets. The performance of the businesses and assets we acquire through acquisitions may not match the historical performance of our other assets. Nor can we assure you that the businesses and assets we may acquire will perform at levels meeting our expectations. We may find that we overpaid for the acquired business or assets or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed. For example, in 2014, we recognized an impairment loss of the full carrying value of goodwill totaling $420.2 million, which was primarily associated with certain large acquisitions in prior years. It may also take several quarters or longer for us to fully integrate newly acquired business and assets into our business, during which period our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. Further, certain one-time expenses associated with such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating servicing, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility in servicing, lending, purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns.\nThe integration process can be complicated and time consuming and could potentially be disruptive to borrowers of loans serviced by the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its borrowers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within our expected timeframe, or we could lose subservicing business or employees of the acquired business. Through acquisitions, we may enter into business lines in which we have not previously operated. Such acquisitions could require additional integration costs and efforts, including significant time from senior management. We may not be able to achieve the synergies we anticipate from acquired businesses, and we may not be able to grow acquired businesses in the manner we anticipate. In fact, the businesses we acquire could decrease in size, even if the integration process is successful.\nFurther, prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices that we considered to be acceptable, and we expect that we will experience this condition in the future. In addition, to finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or we could raise additional equity capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\nThe timing of closing of our acquisitions is often uncertain. We have in the past and may in the future experience delays in closing our acquisitions, or certain tranches of them. For example, we and the applicable seller are often required to obtain certain regulatory and contractual consents as a prerequisite to closing, such as the consents of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the FHFA and trustees to RMBS securitization trusts. Accordingly, even if we and the applicable seller are efficient and proactive, the actions of third parties can impact the timing under which such consents are obtained. We and the applicable seller may not be able to obtain all the required consents, which may mean that we are unable to acquire all the assets that we wish to acquire. Regulators may have questions relating to aspects of our acquisitions and we may be required to devote time and resources responding to those questions. It is also possible that we will expend considerable resources in the pursuit of an acquisition that, ultimately, either does not close or is terminated.\nRisks Relating to the Integration of PHH\nWe may not successfully integrate the businesses of Ocwen and PHH, which would impair our ability to return to profitability and execute on key initiatives throughout Ocwen.\nSuccessfully integrating the business, operations, and personnel of Ocwen and PHH is critical in order for us to create value, reengineer our cost structure, restore our focus on growth, and fulfill our regulatory commitments. If we cannot execute an efficient and effective integration process, it may not be possible to capture the expected synergies of our acquisition of PHH to the extent, or on the timeframe, anticipated. The integration of businesses is complex and time-consuming. The difficulties that could be encountered include with respect to the following:\n\u2022\nmaintaining subservicing and other business relationships;\n\u2022\nintegrating operations and systems, including integration of information technology systems and our planned transition to Black Knight MSP\u037e\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s ability to train and integrate personnel;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations\u037e\n\u2022\ndistraction of management and employees from operations and strategic initiatives\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges or conflicts in corporate culture\u037e\n\u2022\nretaining existing customers and attracting new customers\u037e\n\u2022\nretaining existing employees and attracting new employees\u037e and\n\u2022\ninefficiencies associated with the integration and management of the operations of the two companies.\nIn addition, there have been and will continue to be integration costs and non-recurring transaction costs. These costs include fees paid to legal, financial, accounting and other advisors, as well as the costs associated with combining operations, such as severance payments and the costs of executing technology transitions, and such costs may be significant.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including estimated cost synergies, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process and realizing such benefits, could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may materially adversely affect the value of our shares of common stock.\nContinuing uncertainties associated with the PHH acquisition may cause a loss of employees or customers and may otherwise affect the future business and operations of Ocwen and the combined company.\nContinuing uncertainty about the effect of the PHH acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Ocwen as we proceed with our integration plans. For instance, as noted above, following the acquisition of PHH, we have experienced significant turnover of both management and non-management employees. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could also cause our servicing clients, suppliers, licensees, partners and other business partners to defer entering into contracts with, making other decisions concerning, or seeking to change existing business relationships with Ocwen. Because Ocwen depends on the experience and industry knowledge of its executives and other key personnel to execute their business plans, we may be unable to meet our strategic objectives.\nOcwen assumed all of PHH\u2019s liabilities upon completion of the PHH acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on Ocwen\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operation, or could otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits to Ocwen of the acquisition.\nUpon completion of the acquisition of PHH, Ocwen assumed all of PHH\u2019s liabilities by operation of law. Similar to Ocwen and other mortgage loan servicers and lenders, PHH and its subsidiaries are routinely, and currently, defendants in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of PHH's business, including class action proceedings. These proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing mortgage servicing and lending activities, and contractual obligations. Similar to Ocwen and other mortgage loan servicers and lenders, PHH and its subsidiaries are also routinely, and currently, subject to government and regulatory examinations, investigations and inquiries or other requests for information. The outcome of any legal or regulatory matter is inherently difficult to predict or estimate and the ultimate time to resolve any such matter may be protracted. In addition, the outcome in one or more legal or regulatory matters may affect the outcome of other pending or threatened legal or regulatory matters. The ultimate resolution of any particular legal or regulatory matter, whether through negotiated settlement, court rulings or otherwise, could be material to Ocwen\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations or could otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits to Ocwen of the PHH acquisition.\nRisks Relating to Tax Matters\nFailure to retain the tax benefits provided by the USVI would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOMS is incorporated and headquartered in the USVI. The USVI has an EDC that provides EDC Benefits to certain qualified businesses that enable us to avail ourselves of significant tax benefits for a 30-year period. OMS received its\ncertificate to operate as a company qualified for EDC Benefits in October 2012. It is possible that we may not be able to retain our qualifications for the EDC Benefits, or that changes in U.S. federal, state, local, territorial or USVI taxation statutes or applicable regulations may cause a reduction in or an elimination of the value of the EDC Benefits, all of which could result in an increase to our tax expense, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if the USVI were to undergo a financial reorganization, it is possible that the EDC Benefits could be adversely impacted as a part of any such reorganization, which could jeopardize our ability to return to profitability.\nWe may be subject to increased United States federal income taxation.\nOMS is incorporated under the laws of the USVI and intends to operate in a manner that will cause a substantial amount of its net income to be treated as not related to a trade or business within the United States, which will cause such income to be exempt from current United States federal income taxation. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that OMS is engaged in a trade or business within the United States with respect to that income.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that OMS has been engaged in a trade or business within the United States with respect to that income in any taxable year, it may become subject to current United States federal income taxation on such income. In addition, changes in the Code, state statutes, regulations or court decisions relevant to the various aspects of our business such as various international tax reform proposals being considered by Congress could increase our tax expense.\nThe recently enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense and net operating loss carryforwards, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), a new minimum tax enacted to prevent companies from stripping earnings out of the U.S. through U.S. tax deductible payments made to foreign affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nChanges in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect Ocwen\u2019s financial results.\nOcwen is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the Federal, state and local levels where it does business, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Legislation or regulation, which could affect Ocwen\u2019s tax burden, could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. Ocwen cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments, which could have a negative impact on the financial results.\nAny \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could substantially limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Ocwen had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $428.1 million, which we estimate to be worth approximately $57.2 million to Ocwen under our present assumptions related to Ocwen\u2019s various relevant jurisdictional tax rates as a result of recently passed tax legislation (which assumptions reflect a significant degree of uncertainty). As of December 31, 2018, Ocwen had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $29.9 million in the U.S. jurisdiction. NOL carryforwards and certain built-in losses or deductions may be subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Section 382) (or comparable provisions of foreign or state law) in the event that certain changes in ownership were to occur as measured under Section 382. In addition, tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 383 (Section 383). We periodically evaluate whether certain changes in ownership have occurred as measured under Section 382 that would limit our ability to utilize our NOL and tax credit carryforwards. If it is determined that an ownership change(s) has occurred, there may be annual limitations on the use of these NOL carryforwards, certain built-in losses or deductions, and tax credit carryforwards under Sections 382 and 383 (or comparable provisions of foreign or state law). We have evaluated whether we experienced an ownership change as measured under Section 382, and determined that an ownership change did occur in January 2015 and in December 2017 in the U.S. jurisdiction, which also results in an ownership change under Section 382 in the USVI jurisdiction. This determination was made based on information available as of the date of our Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Due to the Section 382 and 383 limitations and the maximum carryforward period for our NOLs and tax credits, we will be unable to fully recognize certain\ndeferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, we have reduced our gross deferred tax asset related to our NOLs by $160.9 million, our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset by $29.5 million and corresponding valuation allowance by $55.7 million. The realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets (including NOLs and tax credits) is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods. In addition, the limitation on the utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards could result in Ocwen incurring a current tax liability in future tax years. Our inability to utilize our pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards, any future recognized built-in losses or deductions, and tax credit carryforwards could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, any future changes in our ownership or sale of our stock could further limit the use of our NOLs and tax credits in the future.\nAs part of our Section 382 evaluation and consistent with the rules provided within Section 382, Ocwen relies strictly on the existence or absence, as well as the information contained in certain publicly available documents (e.g., Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G or other documents filed with the SEC) to identify shareholders that own a 5-percent or greater interest in Ocwen stock throughout the period tested. Further, Ocwen relies on such public filings to identify dates in which such 5-percent shareholders acquired, disposed, or otherwise transacted in Ocwen common stock. As the requirement for filing such notices of ownership from the SEC is to report beneficial ownership, as opposed to actual economic ownership of the stock of Ocwen, certain SEC filings may not represent ownership in Ocwen stock that should be considered in determining whether Ocwen experienced an ownership change under the Section 382 rules. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences (regarding Ocwen\u2019 s ability to rely on the existence and absence of information in publicly filed Schedules 13D and 13G), the rules prescribed in Section 382 and the regulations thereunder provide that Ocwen may (but is not required to) seek additional clarification from shareholders filing such Schedules 13D and 13G if there are questions or uncertainty regarding the true economic ownership of shares reported in such filing (whether due to ambiguity in the filing, an overly complex ownership structure, the type of instruments owned and reported in the filings, etc.) (often referred to \u201cactual knowledge\u201d questionnaires). Such information can be sought on a filer by filer basis (i.e., there is no requirement that if actual knowledge is sought with respect to one shareholder, actual knowledge must be sought with respect to all shareholders that filed schedules 13D or 13G). While the seeking of actual knowledge can be beneficial in some instances it may be detrimental in others. Once such actual knowledge is received, Section 382 requires the inclusion of such actual knowledge, even if such inclusion is detrimental to the conclusion reached.\nOcwen has performed its analysis of the rules under Section 382 and, based on all currently available information, identified it experienced an ownership change for Section 382 purposes in January 2015 and December 2017. Prior to 2018, Ocwen was aware of shareholder activity in 2015 and 2017 that may have caused a Section 382 ownership change(s), but determined that additional information could potentially be obtained from certain shareholders that would indicate a Section 382 ownership change had not occurred. In completing this analysis, Ocwen identified several shareholders that filed a schedule 13G during the period disclosing a greater than 5-percent interest in Ocwen stock where beneficial versus economic ownership of the stock was unclear and Ocwen therefore requested further details. As of the date of this Form 10-K, Ocwen has not received all requested responses from selected shareholders, and will continue to consider such shareholders as economic owners of Ocwen\u2019s stock until actual knowledge is otherwise received.\nOcwen is continuing to monitor the ownership in its stock to evaluate information that will become available later in 2019 and that may result in a different outcome for Section 382 purposes and our future cash tax obligations. As part of this monitoring, Ocwen periodically evaluates whether it is appropriate and beneficial to retroactively seek actual knowledge on certain previously identified and included 5-percent shareholders, whereby, depending on the responses received, Ocwen may conclude that either the January 2015 or December 2017 Section 382 ownership changes may have instead occurred on a different date, or did not occur at all. As such, our analysis regarding the amount of tax attributes that may be available to offset taxable income in the future without restrictions imposed by Section 382 may continue to evolve.\nThe planned reorganization of our USVI operations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with our acquisition of PHH, overall corporate simplification and cost reduction efforts, we are planning a legal entity reorganization whereby two primary licensed entities would be merged into PHH. As a result of this reorganization, a portion of our USVI operations and assets will be transferred to the U.S. At this time, we expect the reorganization to result in efficiencies and operational cost savings through reduced complexity and a simplification of our global structure.\nAlthough we expect the reorganization to result in efficiencies and operational cost savings, it is uncertain how the reorganization will ultimately impact Ocwen from a U.S. federal, state and USVI income tax perspective. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation and guiding regulations (which are still being promulgated and finalized) on its global tax position. It is possible that our interpretation of the new tax legislation and related guidance that has been provided to date, and for which we are relying on to conclude upon the tax consequences of the reorganization and the future business operations, will not be consistent with final guidance provided by the IRS. In addition, the reorganization of the USVI operations could result in a write-down of our net deferred tax assets, including our NOL carryforwards, as well as a permanent loss of our EDC Benefits in the USVI. Finally, the IRS or the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) may challenge our conclusions regarding the taxation associated with the reorganization and future business operations which could result in an increase to our\ncurrent income tax obligations. The reorganization and future business operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to the uncertainty of how the new U.S. tax legislation will impact our global tax position, as well as the other factors noted above.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price experiences substantial volatility and has dropped significantly on a number of occasions in recent periods, which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated during 2018 between $1.23 per share and $4.75 per share and the closing stock price on February 22, 2019 was $2.00 per share. Therefore, the volatility and recent decline in our stock price may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to factors both within and outside our control, including regulatory action, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements or speculative trading in our stock (e.g., traders \u201cshorting\u201d our common stock), as well as a variety of other factors including those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, including the New York Stock Exchange, have, at times, experienced extreme price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock.\nWhen the market price of a company's shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us, even if unsuccessful, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources. Further, if the average closing price of our stock over thirty consecutive trading days were to fall below $1.00, we would need to take immediate steps to avoid de-listing by the New York Stock Exchange. Such measures could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management attention, and could include implementing a reverse stock split, which would entail additional risk, and success in preventing de-listing would not be assured.\nWe have several large shareholders, and such shareholders may vote their shares to influence matters requiring shareholder approval.\nBased on SEC filings, certain shareholders, such as investors Deer Park Road Management Company, LP and Leon G. Cooperman, own or control significant amounts of our common stock. These and our other large shareholders each have the ability to vote a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock on all matters put to a vote of our shareholders. As a result, these shareholders could influence matters requiring shareholder approval, including the amendment of our articles of incorporation, the approval of mergers or similar transactions and the election of directors. For instance, we held a special meeting of shareholders in November 2018 in order to implement an amendment to our articles of incorporation that management believed was necessary to help us preserve certain tax assets, but in part due to the fact that we did not receive the vote of several large shareholders, the proposal was not adopted by our shareholders. If, in the future, situations arise in which management and certain large shareholders have divergent views, we may be unable to take actions management believes to be in the best interests of Ocwen.\nFurther, certain of our large shareholders also hold significant percentages of stock in companies with which we do business. It is possible these interlocking ownership positions could cause these shareholders to take actions based on factors other than solely what is in the best interests of Ocwen.\nOur board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional securities that may cause dilution and may depress the price of our securities.\nOur charter permits our board of directors, without our stockholders\u2019 approval, to:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock in connection with future equity offerings or acquisitions of securities or other assets of companies; and\n\u2022\nclassify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares, including the issuance of shares of preferred stock that have preference rights over the common stock and existing preferred stock with respect to dividends, liquidation, voting and other matters or shares of common stock that have preference rights over common stock with respect to voting.\nWhile any such issuance would be subject to compliance with the terms of our debt and other agreements, our issuance of additional securities could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock in liquidation, or equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 interests and may be senior to our common stock in liquidation or for the purposes of distributions, may harm the market price of our securities.\nWe will continue to seek to access the capital markets from time to time and, subject to compliance with our other contractual agreements, may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. We are not precluded by the terms of our charter from issuing additional indebtedness. Accordingly, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service obligations that could harm our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders and in an increased risk of default on our obligations. If we were to liquidate, holders of our debt and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets before the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings by us may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 interest in us or reduce the market price of our existing securities. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Further, conditions could require that we accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, our existing stockholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our securities and diluting their ownership interest in us.\nBecause of certain provisions in our organizational documents and regulatory restrictions, takeovers may be more difficult, possibly preventing you from obtaining an optimal share price. In addition, significant investments in our common stock may be restricted, which could impact demand for, and the trading price of, our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that we have authority to issue is 220 million, of which 200 million are common shares and 20 million are preferred shares. Our board of directors has the authority, without a vote of the shareholders, to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued and to issue such shares. The issuance of preferred shares could delay or prevent a change in control. Since our board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of the preferred shares without a shareholder vote, our board of directors may give the holders of preferred shares preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of our common shares. In addition, our bylaws include provisions that, among other things, require advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings, which could impact the ability of a third party to acquire control of us or the timing of acquiring such control.\nThird parties seeking to acquire us or make significant investments in us must do so in compliance with state regulatory requirements applicable to licensed mortgage servicers and lenders. Many states require change of control applications for acquisitions of \u201ccontrol\u201d as defined under each state\u2019s laws and regulation, which may apply to an investment without regard to the intent of the investor. For example, New York has a control presumption triggered at 10% ownership of the voting stock of the licensee or of any person that controls the licensee. In addition, we have licensed insurance subsidiaries in New York and Vermont. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of Ocwen unless the person seeking to acquire control has made the relevant filings and received the requisite approvals in New York and Vermont. These regulatory requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals or investments, may delay or prevent a change in control of us and may impact demand for, and the trading price of, our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84007, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "OCN"}
