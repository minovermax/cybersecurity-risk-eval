{"cik": "1660719", "company": "Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our other public filings with the SEC and securities regulatory authorities in Canada. The risks and uncertainties described below are those we currently believe to be material, but they are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently consider not to be material, actually occur or become material risks, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur ability to generate revenues from our products is subject to attaining significant market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\nOur current products, and other products or product candidates that we may develop, acquire or in-license, may not attain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. Even if a product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials, market acceptance of a product will not be known until after it is launched or relaunched and a product may not generate the revenues that we anticipate. The degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance by doctors and other medical specialists of our products as an alternative to other therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe receipt and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing from government and other third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe price of our products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe indications for which the product is approved;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of adoption by healthcare providers;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of product acceptance by target patient populations;\n\u00b7\nrecommendations by pharmacists regarding our products relative to alternative products;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of alternative therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe extent and effectiveness of marketing efforts by our collaborators, third-party distributors and agents;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe existence of adverse publicity regarding our products or similar products and the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally;\n\u00b7\nhistorical experience with a product or similar products and market perception of a product or similar products;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy of our products compared to alternative therapies; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent and severity of side effects as compared to alternative therapies.\nRisks related to the factors above are particularly relevant to our new product acquisitions, including Fibricor, Zontivity and Toprol-XL, and our new product launches, including Yosprala (launched in the U.S. in October 2016) and Blexten (launched in Canada in December 2016). The commencement of commercialization of these products by Aralez in a short period of time will require significant efforts from us and the devotion of substantial resources as we will need to, among other things, establish the commercial infrastructure necessary to support these products. With respect to Yosprala and Blexten, our commercial organization is launching new products to the market. Prescription uptake with respect to Yosprala, for example, has thus far been slower than we expected and we may continue to face challenges relating to our launch of this product. With respect to Zontivity and Fibricor, the products were previously launched and existing market perception may make it challenging for Aralez to successfully relaunch and commercialize these products.\nFor our products, we depend on reimbursement from third-party payors and a failure to obtain coverage or reduction in the extent of reimbursement could reduce our product sales and revenue.\nSales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations and our continued participation in such programs. These entities may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, including in the form of higher mandatory rebates or modified pricing terms.\nIn certain countries, including Canada, where we sell or are seeking or may seek to commercialize our products, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control. We may be unable to timely or successfully negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us, or such coverage, pricing, and reimbursement may differ in separate regions in the same country. A significant reduction in the amount of reimbursement or pricing for our products in one or more countries may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. Certain countries establish pricing and reimbursement amounts by reference to the price of the same or similar products in other countries. If coverage or the level of reimbursement is limited in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in current or new territories. In the United States, the EU member states, and elsewhere, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs. In the United States, for example, the price of drugs has come under intense scrutiny by the President, U.S. Congress and other government officials and political candidates. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-payment levels. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for healthcare products, examining the cost effectiveness of drugs in addition to their safety and efficacy, and limiting or attempting to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.\nChanges in government regulations or private third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our products and adversely affect our future results. Our commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement at anticipated levels for our products. It may be difficult to project the impact of evolving reimbursement mechanics or the willingness of payors to cover our products. If we are unable to obtain or maintain coverage, or coverage is reduced in one or more countries, our pricing may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed. In addition, as the price of drugs undergoes more scrutiny, there is the possibility of retroactive price adjustments or coverage or penalties for prices that may be deemed excessive. If any such actions were applied to the Company, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nFailure to be included in formularies, or restrictions on drugs included in formularies, developed by managed care organizations, governments, hospitals and other organizations may negatively impact the utilization of our products, which could harm our market share and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop\nformularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included on such formularies, failure to achieve favorable formulary status, restrictions on drugs included on formularies such as prior authorizations, step edits or other limitations, or delays in implementing changes to formulary status, may negatively impact the utilization of our products. If our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, our market share and gross margins could be harmed, as could our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we make strategic acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transactions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nA significant part of our business strategy includes acquiring and integrating complementary businesses, products, technologies or other assets, and forming strategic alliances and other business combinations, to help drive future growth. We may also in-license new products or compounds. Acquisitions or similar arrangements may be complex, time-consuming and expensive, and the process of negotiating the acquisition and integrating an acquired product, drug candidate, technology, business or company might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. Moreover, we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or forecasted sales may not materialize.\nIn addition, there are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to closing transactions. If such transactions are not completed for any reason, we will be subject to several risks, including the following: (i) the market price of our common shares may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of our common shares; and (ii) many costs relating to such transactions may be payable by us whether or not such transactions are completed, which costs may be significant.\nIf an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, product or other assets into the Company may also be complex and time-consuming and, if such businesses, products and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following: integrating personnel, operations, manufacturing technology and systems, while maintaining focus on selling and promoting existing and newly-acquired products; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; distracting management and employees from operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; maintaining the business relationships of the acquired company, or the company that previously owned such product, has established, including with healthcare providers, third-party payors and distributors; and managing inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the Company.\nFurthermore, we have incurred, and may incur in the future, restructuring and integration costs and a number of non-recurring transaction costs associated with these acquisitions, combining the operations of the Company and the acquired business and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs may be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, regulatory, manufacturing and accounting advisors, filing fees, transfer and other transaction-related taxes and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the Company and the acquired business. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the acquired business, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Therefore, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.\nFinally, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated or to achieve anticipated benefits and success, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, product, technology or other asset or arrangement. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisition or arrangement after we have expended resources on them.\nFor example, in February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Tribute, in September 2016, we completed the acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to Zontivity, and in October 2016, we completed the acquisition of the U.S. rights to Toprol-XL and the AG. Such transactions represent significant acquisitions for the Company and may expose us to a number of the risks identified above. We may face difficulties in connection with the integration of such businesses with the Company, which integration activities may be complex, time-consuming and disruptive to the operation of our business generally. In particular, as part of our acquisition of the rights to Toprol-XL and the AG and Zontivity, AstraZeneca and Merck, respectively, have agreed to provide us with critical transition services, including services related to supply, technology and packaging, market access and reimbursement, sales and distribution, and certain finance and financial reporting services. We will need to work collaboratively with AstraZeneca and Merck to ensure that such services are provided in an effective and timely manner. We have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that AstraZeneca and Merck devote to such services. If AstraZeneca and/or Merck fail to devote sufficient time and resources to conducting such services, perform such services in a substandard manner, materially breach their obligations to conduct such services or undergo a change of control, it will delay or hinder our ability to successfully commercialize Toprol-XL and/or the AG and/or Zontivity. In addition, the costs incurred in connection with integration activities may be more substantial than we anticipated and, as a result, may significantly reduce or even outweigh any benefits and efficiencies realized during our integration efforts.\nWe may also face challenges transferring the assets, such as contracts, regulatory requirements and technology, to the extent applicable, associated with such acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be successful in our commercialization efforts with respect to such businesses or face increased competition or costs with respect to the acquired products and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated benefits of such transactions. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of such transactions or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nFailure to successfully acquire, license or develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire, license or develop and market additional products and product candidates. The product candidates to which we allocate our resources may not end up being successful. In addition, because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may depend upon pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, license and/or acquire promising pharmaceutical or other healthcare product candidates and products for Canada, the United States and elsewhere. Failure of this strategy would impair our ability to grow.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our business and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u00b7\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u00b7\nincreased or unanticipated costs;\n\u00b7\nfailure of the acquired business to achieve expected financial results;\n\u00b7\nincreased or unexpected competition with respect to the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u00b7\ninability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nFurther, any unapproved product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by applicable regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by applicable regulatory authorities and thus will never make it to market.\nWe currently depend and will in the future depend on third parties to manufacture our products and product candidates. If these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements or any regulatory requirements, the product development and commercialization of our products and candidates will be delayed.\nWe do not have, and have no plans to develop, the internal capability to manufacture our products or product candidates. We rely upon third-party manufacturers and our partners to supply us with the commercial and developmental supplies of our products and product candidates. For example, we have a supply agreement with Patheon pursuant to which Patheon manufactures our requirements for the sale of Yosprala in the United States. In connection with the acquisition of Zontivity, Merck agreed to supply the product to us for a period of up to three years post-closing (although the packaging component must be transferred within one year), after which we must establish a new manufacturer for the product. In addition, with respect to the acquisition of Toprol-XL and the AG, AstraZeneca agreed to supply such products to us for a period of at least 10 years following the closing of such acquisition. The manufacturing facilities of our third-party manufacturers may be inspected from time to time and need to be found to be in full compliance with cGMP, quality system management requirements or similar standards, and we may not be able to ensure that such third parties comply with these obligations. The failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with cGMP regulations, quality system management requirements or similar regulations could result in enforcement action by the FDA or its foreign counterparts, including, but not limited to, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or importation, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval for approved or in-market products, refusal of the government to renew marketing applications, licenses or approve pending applications or supplements, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, imposition of new manufacturing requirements, closure of facilities and criminal prosecution. These enforcement actions could lead to a delay or suspension in production. Furthermore, the failure of our ingredient or material suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements can impact our ability to supply the market with our products. For example, in connection with the approval process for Yosprala, our initial primary aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) supplier had informed us that it received warning letters from the FDA relating to Form 483 inspection deficiencies and as a result we designated our previously designated secondary aspirin API supplier as our primary supplier and approval of Yosprala was significantly delayed.\nThere is no guarantee that manufacturers and API or other material suppliers that enter into commercial supply contracts with us will be financially viable entities going forward, or will not otherwise breach or terminate their agreements with us. If we do not have the necessary commercial supply contracts, or if any of our current or future third party manufacturers or API suppliers are unable to satisfy our requirements or meet any regulatory requirements, and we are or will be required to find alternative sources of supply, there may be additional costs and delays in product development and commercialization of our product candidates or we may be required to comply with additional regulatory requirements.\nIn the event that suppliers of a product, ingredient or any materials we need to manufacture or package our products or licensed products are not available or not for sale at the time we need such ingredient or material in order to\nmeet our required delivery schedule or on commercially reasonable terms, then we could be at risk of a product shortage or stock-out. We rely on our suppliers in many cases to ensure the adequate supply of ingredients, APIs and packaging material and for the timely delivery of orders placed by us. Should we experience a shortage in supply of a product, licensed product, or API, sales of such product or licensed product could be harmed or reduced and our ability to generate revenues from such product or licensed product may be impaired.\nCertain of our products may never be approved for commercial use in all desired jurisdictions. Failure to successfully commercialize our products or develop, gain approval of or commercialize our product candidates would adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.\nWe anticipate that an important component of our success will depend on the successful commercialization of our products upon regulatory approval in territories where our products are not approved, such as Yosprala in Europe (submitted in January 2017) and Canada. Before we can market and sell our products in a particular jurisdiction, we need to obtain necessary regulatory approvals (from the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, EMA in the EU and from similar foreign regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions), and in some jurisdictions, reimbursement authorization. There are no guarantees that we or our commercialization partners will obtain approval in those countries where we wish to commercialize our products. Even if we or our commercialization partners obtain additional regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of our products. These approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nor can any assurance be given that if such approval is secured, the approved labeling will not have significant labeling limitations, including limitations on the indications for which we can market a product, or require onerous risk management programs. Further, our current or future collaboration agreements may terminate, or require us to make certain payments to our collaborators, or our collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us or reduce or eliminate their payments to us under these agreements, based on our inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we fail to successfully commercialize our current and future products, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our development projects are not successful or are significantly delayed, we may not recover our substantial investments in the product candidates and our failure to bring these product candidates to market on a timely basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nEach of our products has a limited shelf life which could result in costs associated with inventory which exceeds the appropriate age limits.\nEach of our products has a limited shelf life. Accordingly, product which exceeds the appropriate age limits may not be sold, may result in product returns and must be destroyed, which would have an adverse financial impact associated with the cost of writing off obsolete inventory.\nWe continue to evaluate the commercial opportunities for our current products and product candidates in connection with our development of a worldwide commercialization strategy. If we are unable to develop sales and marketing capabilities on our own, or through partnerships, we will not be able to fully exploit the commercial potential of our products and the costs of pursuing such a strategy may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe continue to evaluate the commercial opportunities for our products and product candidates in connection with our development of a worldwide commercialization strategy. In June 2015, our Board of Directors appointed Adrian Adams as our new Chief Executive Officer and Andrew I. Koven as our new President and Chief Business Officer, each of whom has experience creating, leading and expanding pharmaceutical companies with marketing and sales capabilities. We have made significant expenditures to secure commercial resources to launch Yosprala in the United States and commercialize other existing products and anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to the commercialization of our current products or products we may acquire and to expand or enhance our marketing capabilities to support our anticipated growth. Any failure or extended delay in the expansion or enhancement of our sales and marketing capabilities or inability to effectively operate in the marketplace alone or together with our partners could adversely impact our business. There can be no assurance that our sales and marketing\nefforts will generate significant revenues and costs of pursuing such a strategy may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Events or factors that may inhibit or hinder our commercialization efforts include:\n\u00b7\nbuilding and developing our own commercial team or playing a role in the commercialization with a partner will be expensive and time-consuming and will result in high cash burn or reduced profitability;\n\u00b7\nfailure to acquire sufficient or suitable personnel to establish, oversee, or implement our commercialization strategy;\n\u00b7\nfailure to recruit, train, oversee and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nfailure to develop a commercial strategy ourselves or together with partners that can effectively reach and persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u00b7\nour or our partners\u2019 inability to secure reimbursement at a reasonable price;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating or acquiring and sustaining an independent commercial organization;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of costs in advance of anticipated revenues and subsequent failure to generate sufficient revenue to offset additional costs; and\n\u00b7\nability to fund our commercialization efforts alone or together with our partners on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be harmed.\nWe are required to expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible, compliant and persuasive in educating physicians to prescribe and pharmacists to dispense our products. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that a consistent and appropriate message about our products is being delivered to our potential customers. Our sales representatives may also experience challenges promoting multiple products when they call on physicians and their office staff. This is particularly true with respect to our products that have competing products prescribed to similar patients. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits of our products and their proper administration and approved indications, our efforts to successfully commercialize our products could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, share price and operations.\nOur reliance on collaborations with third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products is subject to inherent risks and may result in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting our ability to commercialize our products and adversely affecting our profitability.\nWe depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop, manufacture and/or supply our products and, in some cases, we depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize our existing and possibly future products and product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements with others. We also engage and/or may in the future engage third party manufacturers and clinical trial investigators.\nIn addition, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us in the past, and may continue to require us, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others, including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates would typically require us to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. For products we out-license, these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed and\ncommercialized our products or product candidates ourselves and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates.\nContractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us after a specified notice period for any reason or upon a default by us. For example, AstraZeneca and Horizon, with respect to VIMOVO, and Pernix, with respect to Treximet, have the right to terminate their respective agreements with us upon a 90-day notice for any reason. Licensees may have the right to reduce their payments to us under their agreements. For example, Pernix, with respect to Treximet, and AstraZeneca and Horizon, with respect to VIMOVO, have the right to reduce the royalties on net sales of products payable to us under their respective agreements if generic competitors enter the market and attain a pre-determined share of the market for products marketed under the agreements, or if they must pay a royalty to one or more third parties for rights they license from those third parties to commercialize products marketed under the agreements. Further, our current or future collaboration agreements may terminate, or our collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us or reduce or eliminate their payments to us under these agreements, based on our inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approval for our product candidates, certain business performance criteria or our contract manufacturers\u2019 inability to manufacture our products or to supply the sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand. For example, we distribute the Toprol-XL AG product through a distribution agreement with Endo Ventures Limited (\u201cEndo\u201d) (by assignment from Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\u201cPar\u201d) to Endo in connection with Endo International pls\u2019s acquisition of Par), which agreement expires at the end of 2017 and may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances, including performance measures. If our current or future collaborators exercise termination rights they may have, or if the agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, business performance or for other reasons, and we are not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing or commercialization arrangements, we may not be able to effectively develop and/or commercialize our products or product candidates. Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements we may enter into may not be on terms favorable to us.\nCollaborators may decide not to continue marketing our products in certain countries, as was the case when AstraZeneca informed us that, after a strategic business review, it had decided to cease promotion and sampling of VIMOVO by the end of the third quarter of 2013 in certain countries, including the United States and all countries in Europe, other than Spain and Portugal, which have pre-existing contractual relationships with third parties. In addition, collaborators may decide to assign their rights under our agreement to third parties. For example, we had a collaboration agreement with GSK for the development and commercialization of certain triptan combinations using our MT 400 technology, including Treximet, in the United States, and GSK subsequently divested all of its rights, title and interest to develop, commercialize and sell the licensed products in the United States to Pernix.\nOther risks associated with our collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators;\n\u00b7\nour collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or technologies that are incorporated into the products we develop with them;\n\u00b7\nthird parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations;\n\u00b7\nwe may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements;\n\u00b7\nif any collaborator were to breach its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated;\n\u00b7\nour collaborators may be able to exercise control, under certain circumstances, over our ability to protect our patent rights under patents covered by the applicable collaboration agreement; and\n\u00b7\ndisagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.\nThese factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products or reduction in the milestone, royalty payments or profit sharing we receive from our collaborators, or could result in our not being able to commercialize our products. Further, disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products will be delayed or may never be realized.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of or significant reduction in sales to these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe sell our products in the United States and Canada to a limited number of distributors. Under this distribution model, the distributors generally take physical delivery of product and generally sell the product directly to pharmacies or patients. In addition, certain of our products may be highly dependent on a small number of customers. We expect this significant distributor/customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate and grow sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our distributors are able to provide adequate distribution of our products on pricing terms that are favorable to us. Although we believe we can find additional or replacement distributors, if necessary, the pricing terms of such arrangements may not be as favorable to us and our revenue during any period of disruption could suffer and we might incur additional costs. In addition, these distributors/customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net trade accounts receivable balances. The loss of any large distributor/customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete with treatments now being developed and marketed, or which may be developed and marketed in the future by other companies.\nOur products and product candidates will compete with existing and new therapies and treatments. There are also likely to be numerous competitors that are engaged in the development of alternatives to our technologies and products, which could render our products, product candidates and technologies obsolete or non-competitive. For example, our primary competitors will likely include large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and public and private research institutions. Some of these companies have greater research and development capabilities, experience, and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do. Collaborations or mergers between large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with competing drugs and technologies could enhance our competitors\u2019 financial, marketing and other resources. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in developing competing drugs or technologies, obtaining patent protection, obtaining regulatory approval for products, commercializing products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can. Any delays we encounter in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates increases this risk.\nThe competition for VIMOVO, and any PPI-NSAID products that may be developed and receive regulatory approval, may come from the oral NSAID market, specifically the traditional non-selective NSAIDs (such as naproxen and diclofenac), traditional NSAID/gastroprotective agent combination products or combination product packages (such as Arthrotec\u00ae and Prevacid\u00ae NapraPAC\u2122), combinations of NSAIDs and PPIs taken as separate pills and the only remaining COX-2 inhibitor, Celebrex\u00ae. The competition for PA products, such as Yosprala, may come from aspirin itself, other aspirin-combination products that may be introduced, as well as other products used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Toprol-XL and the AG compete against several generic offerings for metoprolol succinate. Zontivity competes with certain products referred to as oral anti-platelets, which market is dominated by the generic offerings for clopidogrel bisulfate. There are also two newer, competitive anti-platelet offerings in this class: Effient\u00ae and Brilinta\u00ae.\nBased upon their drug product and pipeline portfolios and the overall competitiveness of our industry, we believe that we face, and will continue to face, intense competition from other companies for securing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and acquiring licenses to proprietary technology. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative parties, may also succeed with technologies or products that are more effective than any of our current or future technologies or products. Many of our actual or potential competitors, either alone or together with collaborative parties, have substantially greater financial resources, and almost all of our competitors have larger numbers of scientific and administrative personnel than we do. If\nwe cannot successfully compete with new or existing products, our marketing and sales will suffer and we may not ever receive any revenues from sales of products or may not receive sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nContractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens on us and provide special benefits to those customers, including the right to change or terminate the contract in response to budgetary constraints, policy changes or competition.\nA portion of our revenues come from customers that are governmental agencies or vendors to such agencies. These contracts generally contain certain rights for the benefit of the government customer, including termination for convenience, the right to place contracts out for bid before the full contract term, as well as the right to make unilateral changes in contract requirements. For example, in connection with our acquisition of the U.S. rights to Toprol-XL and the AG, we entered into a Novation Agreement with AstraZeneca and the United States of America (the \u201cGovernment\u201d) pursuant to which all of the rights and responsibilities of AstraZeneca under a VA National Contract (the \u201cVA Contract\u201d) between AstraZeneca and the Government were novated to a subsidiary of Aralez. The VA Contract is terminable at the convenience of the Government at any time and the Government could therefore use such right to try to renegotiate pricing terms, which could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.\nGovernment contracts and subcontracts may also be subject to some or all of the following:\n\u00b7\ntermination when appropriated funding for the current fiscal year is exhausted or becomes unavailable;\n\u00b7\n\u201cmost-favored\u201d pricing disclosure requirements that are designed to ensure that the government can negotiate and receive pricing akin to that offered commercially and requirements to submit proprietary cost or pricing data to ensure that government contract pricing is fair and reasonable;\n\u00b7\ncommercial customer price tracking requirements that require contractors to monitor pricing offered to a specified class of customers and to extend price reductions offered to that class of customers to the government;\n\u00b7\nreporting and compliance requirements related to, among other things: equal employment opportunity, affirmative action for veterans and for workers with disabilities, and accessibility for the disabled;\n\u00b7\nbroader audit rights than we would usually grant to non-governmental customers; and\n\u00b7\nspecialized remedies for breach and default or failure to meet service level commitments, including setoff rights, retroactive price adjustments, and civil or criminal fraud penalties, as well as mandatory administrative dispute resolution procedures instead of state contract law remedies.\nIn addition, certain violations of federal law may subject government contractors to having their contracts terminated and, under certain circumstances, suspension and/or debarment from future government contracts.\nGeneric competition to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection for our products, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic competitor of a generic version of our products, we can lose a significant portion of sales of that product, or royalty revenue in the case of out-licensed products, in a very short period, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline. In addition, for products where a generic market already exists, there may be increased generic competition from current or new entrants to the generic market. For example, we currently compete with suppliers of generic versions of Toprol-XL and could face these adverse effects if additional generic competitors enter the market or if there is additional price erosion in the current market.\nIf we lose our license from any licensors, we may be unable to continue a substantial part of our business.\nWe have licensed certain assets, including certain intellectual property, marketing authorizations and related data, and medical commercial and technical information, used in a substantial part of our business. Such license\nagreements may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of our obligations under, or fail to perform any terms of, the agreement and fail to cure that breach. If a license agreement is terminated, then we may lose our rights to utilize the intellectual property and other assets covered by such agreement to manufacture, market, promote, distribute and sell the licensed products, which may prevent us from continuing a substantial part of our business and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and any prospects for growth.\nWe will not be able to commercialize our future product candidates if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.\nWe and our development partners, as applicable, may conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our future product candidates in order to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our future product candidates. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive, can take many years and have uncertain outcomes. If clinical trials are unsuccessful, we will not be able to commercialize our future product candidates and additional studies may be required.\nDevelopments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of the Company\u2019s products.\nEven after a product reaches market, certain developments following regulatory approval, including results in post-marketing requirements, Phase IV trials or other studies, may decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe re-review of products that are already marketed;\n\u00b7\nnew scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;\n\u00b7\nthe recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;\n\u00b7\nchanging government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and\n\u00b7\ngreater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.\nEvents giving rise to concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products, whether or not scientifically justified, can lead to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.\nFor example, if the results of any post-approval studies, including the in-vitro or in-vivo post-marketing studies with Yosprala required by the FDA, demonstrated any potential/hypothetical/actual adverse effects not identified in the predecessor clinical studies, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the Company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes.\nWe depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business as well as our ability to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nWe are highly dependent on the efforts of our key management, especially Adrian Adams, our Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew I. Koven, our President and Chief Business Officer. If we should lose the services of Mr. Adams or Mr. Koven, or are unable to replace the services of our other key personnel who may leave the Company, or if we fail to recruit other key scientific and commercial personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and growth strategies. There is intense competition for qualified scientific and commercial personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business. Furthermore, our future success may also depend in part on the continued service of our other key management personnel and our ability to recruit and retain additional personnel, as required by our business. Many of the other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better\nchances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than that which we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize products and product candidates will be limited.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\nOur international operations and any future international operations may expose us to risks that could negatively impact our future results. Our operations may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected in a country with an economy similar to the United States or Canada. The additional risks that we may be exposed to in these cases include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations, which could decrease the Company\u2019s revenues or increase its costs;\n\u00b7\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u00b7\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws;\n\u00b7\nlimited access to qualified staff;\n\u00b7\ninadequate infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ncultural and language differences;\n\u00b7\ninadequate banking systems;\n\u00b7\ndifferent and/or more stringent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the repatriation of profits or payment of dividends;\n\u00b7\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks or wars;\n\u00b7\nnationalization or expropriation of property;\n\u00b7\nlaw enforcement authorities and courts that are weak or inexperienced in commercial matters; and\n\u00b7\ndeterioration of political relations among countries.\nAny of these factors, or any other international factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline. Similarly, adverse economic conditions impacting our customers in these countries or uncertainty about global economic conditions could cause purchases of our products to decline, which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Any failure to attain our projected revenues and operating results as a result of adverse economic or market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nDue to a portion of our business conducted in currency other than U.S. dollars, we have foreign currency risk.\nOur consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and we report, and will continue to report, our results in U.S. dollars. Some of our transactions are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Any change in the value of currencies in which we transact against the U.S. dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign currency loss or gain. The exchange rates between many of the currencies in which we transact against the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years\nand may fluctuate significantly in the future. Consequently, our reported earnings could fluctuate materially as a result of foreign exchange (translation) gains or losses and may not be comparable from period to period.\nWe face market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign currency exposure on the translation into U.S. dollars of the financial results of our operations in Canada. Exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency impacts to our foreign currency-denominated operating expenses are mitigated to a certain extent by the natural, opposite impact on our foreign currency-denominated revenue. In addition, the repurchase of principal under our U.S. dollar denominated debt may result in foreign exchange gains or losses for Canadian income tax purposes.\nRisks related to Legislation and Regulations\nAs we pursue commercialization of our product portfolio and other opportunities for our future products ourselves, failure to comply with the laws governing the marketing and sale of such products may result in regulatory agencies taking action against us and/or our partners, which could significantly harm our business.\nAs we pursue commercialization of Yosprala, Zontivity, Toprol-XL and the AG, Fibricor and its authorized generic, our Canadian product portfolio and other future products, we will be subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, Health Canada, EMA and the governmental authorities in other countries. In particular, there are many federal, state, provincial and local laws that we will need to comply with in connection with the marketing, promoting, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products. If we fail to comply with U.S., Canadian and European regulatory requirements and those in other countries where our products are sold, we could lose our marketing approvals or be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions, fines or other sanctions. In addition, incidents of adverse drug reactions, unintended side effects or misuse relating to our products could result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions, or even lead to withdrawal of a product from the market. The imposition of one or more of these penalties could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to conduct our business as planned. As a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA, Health Canada, EMA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials, the results of which could result in the subsequent loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. Compliance with the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject is complicated, time-consuming and expensive. We cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations. Even minor, inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that the law has been violated.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations, including \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, anti-bribery laws and privacy and security regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any litigation related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have faced lawsuits and investigations pertaining to violations of healthcare \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other federal, state and provincial laws and regulations. We also face increasingly strict data privacy and security laws in the United States, Canada, the EU and other countries, the violation of which could result in fines and other sanctions. The United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommends, and increasingly states, that pharmaceutical companies have comprehensive compliance programs and disclose certain payments made to healthcare providers or funds spent on marketing and promotion of drug products. While we have developed a corporate compliance program, we cannot assure you that we or our employees or agents are or will be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, provincial or foreign regulations and laws. If we are in violation of any of these requirements or any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs or other sanctions.\nThe FCPA, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (the \u201cCFPOA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we require our employees to consult with our legal department prior to making any payment or gift thought to be exempt under applicable law, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA and/or the CFPOA for\nactions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We may operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different from the United States and Canada. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in criminal or civil penalties or remedial measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nWe are also subject to various privacy and security regulations, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (as amended, \u201cHIPAA\u201d). HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions (e.g., healthcare claims information and plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment, coordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. Failure to comply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. The EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU member states, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Data protection authorities from different EU member states have interpreted the privacy laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. Any failure to comply with the rules arising from the EU Data Protection Directive and related national laws of EU member states could lead to supervisory authority enforcement actions, reputational damage and significant penalties against us, adversely impacting our operating results.\nIn December 2015, a proposal for an EU Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is enforceable from May 25, 2018 will expand our data protection obligations, including by imposing more stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthening the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continuing to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requiring mandatory data breach reporting and notification, increasing penalties for non-compliance and increasing the enforcement powers of the national data protection authorities. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR harmonises EU data protection laws and is intended to make it easier for multinational companies operating across the EU to comply with their data protection obligations. However, it does permit EU member states some flexibility to legislate in a number of areas, which means that inconsistencies may still arise.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably and could adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States and certain state and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The ACA may affect the operational results of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including the Company and other healthcare-related industries, by imposing on them additional costs. Effective January 1, 2010, the ACA increased the minimum Medicaid drug rebates for pharmaceutical companies, expanded the 340B drug discount program, and made changes to affect the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole.\u201d The law also revised the definition of\n\u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which has the potential to affect the amount of our Medicaid drug rebates to states. Beginning in 2011, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded (including authorized generics) prescription drug products.\nThe ACA also added substantial new provisions affecting compliance, some of which required the entire industry to modify business practices with healthcare practitioners. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required in 2013 to comply with the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was passed as part of the ACA and requires pharmaceutical companies to monitor and report payments, gifts, the provision of samples and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation. A variety of federal and state agencies are in the process of implementing the ACA, including through the issuance of rules, regulations or guidance that materially affect our business. The risk of our being found in violation of these rules and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future of the ACA as efforts are underway to repeal and/or replace all or certain aspects of such laws. The outcome of such efforts could have a substantial impact on our business. The ACA, changes thereto or replacements thereof and further changes to healthcare laws or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our compliance or other costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nIn addition, pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adversely affect our business if implemented.\nIn Canada, patented drug products are subjected to regulation by the PMPRB pursuant to the Patent Act (Canada) and the Patented Medicines Regulations. The PMPRB does not approve prices for drug products in advance of their introduction to the market. The PMPRB provides guidelines from which companies like us set their prices at the time they launch their products. All patented pharmaceutical products introduced in Canada are subject to the post-approval, post-launch scrutiny of the PMPRB. Since the PMPRB does not pre-approve prices for a patented drug product in Canada, there may be risk involved in the determination of an allowable price selected for a patented drug product at the time of introduction to the market by the company launching such products in Canada. If the PMPRB does not agree with the pricing assumptions chosen by such company introducing a new drug product, the price chosen could be challenged by the PMPRB pursuant to the PMPRB initiating an investigation and, if it is determined, usually pursuant to an oral tribunal hearing, that the price charged is excessive, the price of the product may be reduced and a fine may be levied against the company for any amount deemed to be in excess of the allowable price determined. Drug products that have no valid patents are not subject to the PMPRB\u2019s jurisdiction.\nOur status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes could be affected by IRS action or a change in U.S. tax law.\nAlthough the Company is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). A corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Company being an entity incorporated in the Province of British Columbia, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception pursuant to which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nUnder Section 7874 of the Code, the Company may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if former Pozen shareholders hold 80% or more of the vote or value of the Company\u2019s shares by reason of holding stock in Pozen immediately after Merger and the Company\u2019s expanded affiliated group after the Merger does not have substantial business activities in Canada relative to its worldwide activities. As a result of the fact that the former shareholders of Pozen owned (within the meaning of Section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the combined entity\u2019s stock immediately after the Merger, we believe we qualify as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Merger. However, there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the\nfuture a subsequent change in the facts or in law, which might cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including with retroactive effect.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the position that the ownership test was satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code, including with respect to the provisions regarding the application of the ownership test. If we were unable to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the benefits associated with enhanced global cash management, including increased liquidity resulting from access to cash generated by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, would be jeopardized.\nOur tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations, or increased scrutiny by tax authorities.\nUnder current law, we expect to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, changes to the rules in Section 7874 of the Code or the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application. In addition, recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, and such legislation, if passed, could have an adverse effect on us.\nMoreover, the United States Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government agencies in Canada and other jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the United States, Canada and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us.\nFor example, in April 2016, the U.S. Treasury and IRS issued temporary regulations that expand the scope of transactions that are subject to the rules designed to eliminate the U.S. tax benefits of inversions, which regulations could limit our ability to engage in certain stock transactions in the future. Additionally, in October 2016 the U.S. Treasury and IRS issued final and temporary regulations that address whether an interest in a related corporation is debt or equity, which regulations would impact the treatment of future inter-company debt and limit the ability to deduct interest thereon.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could adversely affect our effective income tax rate, other tax obligations and profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in Canada, the United States, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate and other tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, disagreements with taxing authorities with respect to the interpretation of tax laws and regulations and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to discretion. If our assessments are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, comprehensive U.S. tax reform continues to be discussed and proposed, including among other items, changes to the corporate tax rate, a border adjustment tax and changes to the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. It is currently uncertain whether any of these changes will be enacted, and if so, the effective dates. If comprehensive tax reform occurs, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly impacted. However, we are unable to determine the potential impact at this time.\nThere can be no assurance that income and other tax laws and administrative policies with respect to the income and other tax consequences generally applicable to us, to our subsidiaries, or to a U.S. or Canadian holder of common shares will not be changed in a manner which adversely affects holders of our common shares.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare, PMPRB obligations, governmental funded drug formularies or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and/or fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) to be incomplete or incorrect. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer price and best price for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due, and CMS may request or require restatements for earlier periods as well. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug discount program.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price (\u201cASP\u201d), or best price information to the government or made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, ASP, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nFederal law requires that a company must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d) pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract, whether due to a misstated federal ceiling price or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our approved products and product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, provincial and local as well as foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, federal, state, provincial or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. We do not currently maintain hazardous materials insurance coverage. If we are subject to any liability as a result of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred losses since inception and we may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have a limited operating history and even less history operating as a combined organization following the Merger. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we had net losses of approximately $103.0 million. Our ability to receive product revenue from the sale of products is dependent on a number of factors, principally the development, regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products and product candidates. We expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter principally as a result of increases and decreases in any development efforts, the timing and amount of payments that we may receive from others and the timing of our commercial expenses, including increased expenses in connection with the commercialization of Yosprala, Zontivity, Toprol-XL, Fibricor and other current or acquired products. If our licensed or marketed products do not perform well in the marketplace, our revenue will be impacted and our business could be materially harmed.\nWe have had limited product revenues and other sources of revenues to date and new sources of revenue have only just been approved or acquired. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability, which would depress the market price of our common shares and could cause our investors to lose all or a part of their investment.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenues from sales of our products. New sources of product revenue have only recently been approved, in the case of Yosprala in the United States and Blexten in Canada, or acquired by the Company, in the case of Zontivity in the United States and Canada and Toprol-XL and the AG in the United States. In addition, Tribute only acquired Fibricor in May 2015. The ability of such products to generate revenues depends on a variety of factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts and competition in applicable markets. Product revenue for products which we license out is dependent upon the commercialization efforts of our partners. One of our primary sources of revenue to date is the royalty payments that we may receive in connection with the commercialization of VIMOVO by AstraZeneca, outside of the United States (excluding Japan), and Horizon in the United States. In the event that AstraZeneca, Horizon or any other third-party with future commercialization rights to any of our products or product candidates fails to adequately commercialize those products or product candidates because it lacks adequate financial or other resources, decides to focus on other initiatives or otherwise, our ability to successfully commercialize our products or product candidates in the applicable jurisdictions would be limited, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, our ability to generate future revenues depends in part on our success in:\n\u00b7\ncommercialization of our existing products and any other product candidates for which we obtain approval or that we acquire;\n\u00b7\nobtaining approval for Yosprala in Canada and the EU;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping, acquiring or in-licensing and commercializing a portfolio of other products or product candidates in addition to our current products.\nEven if we do generate additional product sales, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe may need additional funding and may not have access to capital. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may need to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional funds to execute our evolving business strategy. We have incurred losses from operations since inception and we may continue to incur additional operating losses. Our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\ncompleting the regulatory approval process, and any further required clinical development related thereto, for product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to commercialize or arrange for the commercialization of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of commercialization of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\ngeneric competition with respect to our products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of our payment or receipt, as applicable, of milestone payments and royalties under collaborative, license, acquisition or other agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of changes and developments in, or termination of, our collaborative, license, acquisition and other relationships;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any additional collaborative, license, acquisition and other arrangements that we may establish; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to acquire or in-license additional complementary products or products that augment our current product portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $64.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. In connection with the closing of the Merger, we received a $75 million equity investment and issued $75 million in convertible debt. In addition, pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Debt Facility Agreement (the \u201cFacility Agreement\u201d), dated December 7, 2015, among us, Pozen, Tribute (\u201cthe Credit Parties\u201d) and certain lenders party thereto, we had the ability to borrow up to an additional aggregate principal amount of $200 million for acquisitions. On October 31, 2016, the Company borrowed the full $200 million that had been available under the Facility Agreement for acquisitions, $175 million of which was used to fund the upfront cash closing payment for the acquisition of Toprol-XL and the AG and $25 million of which was used to replenish the Company\u2019s cash balance for the initial upfront payment of $25 million in cash paid at the closing of the Zontivity acquisition in September 2016. In addition to this borrowing, pursuant to a consent provided by the requisite lenders under the Facility Agreement with respect to the Toprol-XL acquisition, the lenders under the Facility Agreement agreed that they and/or affiliated funds will make available additional loans to the Credit Parties in an aggregate amount of up to $250 million for the payment of the purchase price of any acquisitions permitted by the terms of the Facility Agreement (as modified by such consent) with respect to target businesses mutually approved by, and as otherwise mutually agreed upon, by the Company and the lenders, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Facility Agreement. Any such loans (to the extent made available) may be borrowed in one or more advances at any time prior to April 3, 2018. We have not yet borrowed any of this additional $250 million available amount.\nWe may need to raise additional capital if we choose to expand our commercialization or development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate, if we develop, acquire or in-license additional products or acquire companies or if our revenues do not meet expectations. In addition, our expenses might increase beyond currently expected levels if we decide to, or any regulatory agency requires us to, conduct additional clinical trials, studies or investigations for any of our product candidates, including in connection with the consideration, or reconsideration, of our regulatory filings for our product candidates. We began commercializing Yosprala in the United States without a commercial partner and our expenses have increased and may continue to increase relative to prior years as we continue the transition from a development company that licenses its product candidates to other companies into a fully integrated, specialty pharmaceutical company.\nWe may be unable to raise additional equity funds when we desire to do so due to unfavorable market conditions in our industry, or generally, or due to other unforeseen developments in our business. Further, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the\ndevelopment or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates, or delay, cut back or abandon our plans to grow the business through acquisition or in-licensing. We also could be required to:\n\u00b7\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u00b7\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nAny of the above events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects and cause the price of our common shares to decline.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish intellectual property rights to our product candidates.\nAdditional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders. Debt, receivables and royalty financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, or existing debt refinanced, each of which could also result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nAs noted above, in connection with our acquisitions of Toprol-XL and the AG and Zontivity, we have borrowed an additional $200 million under the Facility Agreement. This substantial debt obligation could have adverse consequences, including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to servicing this indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations and pursue future business opportunities and making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to indebtedness.\nCovenants and financial performance thresholds imposed by the Facility Agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants and financial performance thresholds, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Facility Agreement imposes various covenants that limit our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge with or into another person;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or distributions;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur or suffer liens;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur, assume guarantee or be liable with respect to indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nacquire assets or transfer products or material assets; and\n\u00b7\nissue equity securities senior to our common shares or convertible or exercisable for equity securities senior to our common shares.\nThe covenants imposed by the Facility Agreement and our obligations to service our outstanding debt:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u00b7\nmay require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the limitations and decreased flexibility on our business due to our debt obligations, we may not be able to capitalize on strategic opportunities or grow our business to the extent we would be able to without these limitations. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the Facility Agreement, which could permit the required lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Toprol-XL acquisition, the Facility Agreement was amended to include additional financial performance thresholds, including a minimum adjusted EBITDA threshold and a minimum specified revenue threshold relating to net sales of Toprol-XL and the AG received by the Company. In the event of the failure to meet both such additional financial performance thresholds, the lenders thereunder may elect to have the then outstanding principal balance of certain term loans under the Facility Agreement amortize quarterly through the maturity thereof.\nTo service our debt, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation and could cause the market value of common shares to decline.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend principally upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Product Liability\nWe may become involved in infringement actions which are uncertain, costly and time-consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nThe pharmaceutical industry historically has generated substantial litigation concerning the manufacture, use and sale of products, and we expect this litigation activity to continue. The intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies, including us, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In order to protect or enforce patent rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties. If we are not successful in defending an attack on our patents and maintaining exclusive rights to market one or more of our products still under patent protection,\nwe could lose a significant portion of sales in a very short period. We may also become subject to infringement claims by third parties and may have to defend against charges that we infringed patents or the proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could lose our right to develop or sell products, including our generic products, or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. The outcomes of infringement actions are uncertain and infringement actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nThird parties seeking to market generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products in the United States often file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d) with the FDA (with a similar process in Canada and other foreign countries) containing a certification stating that the ANDA applicant believes that the patents protecting the branded pharmaceutical product are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Such certifications are commonly referred to as Paragraph IV certifications. We and Horizon are engaged in Paragraph IV litigations with several generic pharmaceutical companies with respect to our VIMOVO patents. In addition, in December 2016, the Company received a Paragraph IV certification from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. indicating that it had filed an ANDA for a generic version of Yosprala 81mg/40 mg and 325mg/40mg. If we are unsuccessful in any of these proceedings, or once our or our licensors\u2019 applicable patents expire, and the FDA or Health Canada approve a generic version of one of our marketed products, such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on sales of such product, our business and our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nThe pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain and to keep protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can stop others from using our inventions. Our success also will depend on our ability to prevent others from using our trade secrets. In addition, we must operate in a way that does not infringe, or violate, the patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights of other parties.\nWe cannot know how much protection, if any, our patents will provide or whether our patent applications will issue as patents. The breadth of claims that will be allowed in patent applications cannot be predicted and neither the validity nor enforceability of claims in issued patents can be assured. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain and enforce valid claims covering our products and technology, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the same or similar technology or to prevent competitors from marketing identical products. For example, if we and our partner Horizon are unsuccessful in protecting our patents in the litigation against several generic pharmaceutical companies who have filed ANDAs for VIMOVO, such companies could market a generic version of the product prior to the expiration of our patents.\nFurthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the patent applications we hold fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop them and threaten our ability to commercialize our products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found invalid or unenforceable or will go unthreatened by third parties. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products or any other product candidates. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States may be able to be provoked by a third-party or instituted by us to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications or, as in many jurisdictions, such as in Canada, the earlier filed third-party application may be cited against our patent application by a patent office in rejecting our application on the basis that the invention lacks novelty.\nOur ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States and other jurisdictions, and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, in 2011, the Leahy-Smith\nAmerica Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was enacted, and it included a number of significant changes to patent law in the United States. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures making it easier for third parties to challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the prosecution of patent applications. For example, third parties have filed petitions seeking Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) of some of our VIMOVO patents and one of our Treximet patents. These petitions have been denied or concluded with a final written decision upholding the challenged claims. In the IPRs concluded by a final written decision, the parties may still seek an appeal. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contains statutory provisions that require the United States Patent and Trademark Office to issue new regulations for their implementation and it may take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the new statute. Accordingly, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business and the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows applicants seeking approval of biosimilar or interchangeable versions of biological products to initiate a process for challenging some or all of the patents covering the innovator biological product used as the reference product. This process is complicated and could result in the limitation or loss of certain patent rights. An inability to obtain, enforce and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States and Canada. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property in the United States, Canada and other countries. For example, if the issuance to us, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. For example, since patent protection is territorial, the teachings of a U.S. patent will generally only be protected in the United States. If we do not have a corresponding patent in another jurisdiction, the teachings of the U.S. patent may be in the public domain in such jurisdiction and free for a third-party to practice. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States, Canada and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have enforceable trade secret protection with respect thereto, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by the Company during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with the Company. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties, which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to the Company will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to the Company. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside Canada and the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to significant product liability and other claims in the event that the use of our products caused, or is alleged to have caused, adverse effects. For example, we may be sued if any of our products or product candidates allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. The withdrawal of a product following complaints and/or incurring significant costs, including the requirement to pay substantial damages in personal injury cases or product liability cases, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nOur product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our claims and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost in the future. We will explore, on an on-going basis, expanding our insurance coverage related to the sale of our products and future marketed products when we obtain marketing approval for such products and commercial sales of such products begin. However, we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. If a plaintiff brings a successful product liability claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, we may incur substantial liabilities and our business may be harmed or fail.\nFor example, if proton pump inhibitors are found, or are perceived, to create health risks, our ability to sell Yosprala could be materially adversely affected, product liability lawsuits may be brought against us, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nIf our products or technologies are stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, others could use our products or licensed products to produce competing products or technologies.\nThird parties, including our partners, contract manufacturers, contractors and others involved in our business often have access to our products, licensed products, and technologies. If our products, licensed products or technologies were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties that may be able to reproduce our products, licensed products, or technologies for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares\nThe price of our common shares could be volatile, which may result in significant losses to our shareholders.\nThe trading price of our common shares could be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our operating results and revenues generated by our marketed products;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations, acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nprolonged stock shortages from third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\npublished reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\npositive or negative progress with our clinical trials or with regulatory approvals of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncommercial success of VIMOVO, Fibricor, Yosprala, Zontivity, Toprol-XL and our other products and product candidates once approved;\n\u00b7\ngeneric introductions of existing marketed products with no generic competition, such as Yosprala, or additional generic competition for Toprol-XL and the AG;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulation, including reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our relationships with collaborative partners or our inability to obtain consents or achieve minimum licensing terms;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by our collaborative partners regarding our products or product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in new or pending litigation;\n\u00b7\npublic concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire or license new products or companies and the perception of the value of such transactions, and our ability to integrate and grow such products or companies;\n\u00b7\nthe sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common shares into the market; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions.\nThe common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Volatility in the market prices of our common shares may increase as a result of our common shares being listed on both the NASDAQ Global Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange because trading is split between the two markets, resulting in less liquidity on both exchanges. In addition, different liquidity levels, volume of trading, currencies and market conditions on the two exchanges may result in different prevailing trading prices.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the stocks of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common shares, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common shares in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nIf our existing shareholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, the trading price of our common shares could decline. Certain shareholders hold significant positions in our common shares. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, including sales or distributions of shares by our large investors, or the perception that such sales or distributions might occur, could harm the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Further, shareholder ownership will be diluted if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities. In addition, our common shares that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are or may become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional common shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common shares could decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Articles and certain provisions under the BCBCA could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor and may prevent shareholders from changing the direction of our business or management.\nProvisions of our Articles and certain provisions under the BCBCA may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might\notherwise receive a premium for their shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by shareholders to change the direction or management of the Company. For example, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares without any need for action by shareholders;\n\u00b7\nrequire a 75% majority of shareholder votes cast in favor of a resolution to remove a director;\n\u00b7\nrequire a 66 2/3% majority of shareholder votes cast in favor of a resolution to effect various amendments to our Articles;\n\u00b7\nrequire that in the case of shareholder action by written consent, (i) a matter that would normally require an ordinary resolution shall require written consent by shareholders representing at least 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast in favor of such resolution, and (ii) in the case of any other resolution of the shareholders, the written consent of shareholders representing 100% of the votes entitled to be cast in favor of such resolution;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors; and\n\u00b7\nrequire shareholder proposals for matters to be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings to be submitted pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the BCBCA for inclusion in the Company\u2019s proxy materials by a date that is not later than three months prior to the anniversary date of the prior year\u2019s shareholder meeting.\nThese provisions, among others, whether alone or together, could delay or impede hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or management. Any provision of our constating documents that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their common shares and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common shares.\nProvisions of Canadian law may delay, prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our common shares or assets.\nThe Investment Canada Act subjects an acquisition of control of us by a non-Canadian to government review if our enterprise value as calculated pursuant to the legislation exceeds a threshold amount. A reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant Minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada. This could prevent or delay a change of control and may eliminate or limit strategic opportunities for shareholders to sell their common shares.\nThe rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights typically offered to shareholders of a U.S. corporation and these differences may make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, and therefore certain of the rights of holders of its shares are governed by Canadian law, including the provisions of the BCBCA, and by our Notice of Articles and Articles. These rights differ in certain respects from the rights of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations and these differences may make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nAn investor may be unable to bring actions or enforce judgments against us and certain of our directors.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Some of our directors reside principally outside of the United States and a substantial portion of our assets and a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may not be possible for an investor to effect service of process within the United States on us or those persons. Furthermore, it may not be possible for an investor to enforce judgments obtained in United States courts based upon the civil liability provisions of United States federal securities laws or other laws of the United States against us or those persons.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and our shareholders must rely on increases in the trading price of our common shares for returns on their investment.\nExcept for the $1.75 per share special cash distribution by Pozen on December 30, 2013 (representing a surplus of corporate cash and accounted for as a return of capital to shareholders), we have never paid cash dividends on our common shares and do not expect to pay dividends in the immediate future. We anticipate that the Company will retain all earnings, if any, to support our operations. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common shares will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Company\u2019s results of operations, current and anticipated cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, contractual restrictions and financing agreement covenants, solvency tests imposed by corporate law and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Holders of our common shares must rely on increases in the trading price of our shares for returns on their investment in the foreseeable future. In addition, the Facility Agreement prohibits the Company from making any cash dividend or distributing any of its assets, including its intangibles, to any of its shareholders in such capacity or its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. The Facility Agreement also includes restrictions on the Company from incurring liens and undertaking indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, which limitations may further impact the ability of the Company to pay any future dividends. See \u201cCovenants and financial performance thresholds imposed by the Facility Agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants and financial performance thresholds, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected\u201d above.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur if we were a private company. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, applicable securities laws in Canada, the NASDAQ Global Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. These rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. Further, these rules and regulations may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards.\nIn particular, our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosures in Issuers\u2019 Annual and Interim Filings and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors\u2019 audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified, and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented. While we do not anticipate any material weaknesses, the inability of management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting as effective could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. The existence of this or one or more other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such weakness or failure to remediate any existing material weakness could materially adversely affect our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of our various agreements.\nWe are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, the laws, regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult, or increasingly more expensive, for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Further, members of the Board of Directors and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties. As a result, we may face difficulties attracting and retaining\nqualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our securities, and the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our share price. If one or more of the securities analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these securities analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common shares could decrease, which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 88740, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ARLZQ"}
