{"cik": "1581091", "company": "RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties. An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before making an investment decision. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have grouped our risks according to:\n\u25cf Risks Related to Our Business;\n\u25cf Risks Related to Our Industry;\n\u25cf Risks Related to Our Legal and Capital Structure;\n\u25cf Risks Related to Governmental Regulations; and\n\u25cf General Risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may fail to execute our strategies to grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe intend to pursue a number of strategies to grow our revenue and earnings and to deploy the cash generated by our business. We constantly strive to increase the value proposition for our franchisees, agents and loan originators. If we do not reinvest in our business in ways that make our networks attractive to franchisees, agents and loan originators, we may become less competitive. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to acquire other businesses, including RE/MAX independent regional franchises, or other businesses that are complementary to our core businesses, particularly those offering differentiated technology. If we fail to develop, execute, or focus on our business strategy, fail to make good business decisions, fail to enforce a disciplined management process to ensure that our investment of resources aligns with our strategic plan and our core management and franchising competencies or fail to properly focus resources or management attention on strategic areas, any of these could negatively impact the overall value of the Company.\nOur business is heavily reliant on technology and product development for certain key aspects of our operations. We may fail to roll out technology platforms as expected or their effectiveness in attracting or retaining agents, loan originators and franchisees may be more limited than anticipated.\nOur systems may not perform as desired or we may experience cost overages, delays, or other factors that may distract our management from our business, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain future new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, including those related to our recent technology acquisitions.\nRecent technology acquisitions were made to bolster our value proposition and ultimately assist in attracting and retaining agents, loan originators and franchisees. If these technology platforms are delivered later than expected, do not create a distinct competitive edge for agents, loan originators and franchisees, or have a poorer than expected adoption rate by agents, loan originators and franchisees, the introduction of such platforms may not be effective in attracting or retaining agents, loan originators and franchisees.\nFailing to attract and retain highly qualified franchisees could compromise our ability to maintain or expand the RE/MAX and Motto networks.\nAlthough we believe our relationship with our franchisees and their agents and loan originators is open and strong, the nature of such relationships can give rise to conflict. For example, franchisees, agents or loan originators may become dissatisfied with the fees and dues owed to us, particularly in the event that we increase fees and dues. They may disagree with certain network-wide policies and procedures, including policies dictating brand standards or affecting their marketing efforts. They may also be disappointed with our marketing campaigns. If we experience any conflicts with our franchisees on a large scale, our franchisees may decide not to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration or may file lawsuits against us or they may seek to disaffiliate with us, which could also result in litigation. These events may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAn organized franchisee association could pose risks to our ability to set the terms of our franchise agreements and our pricing. A group of broker/owners from around the country have founded and committed to the continued success and funding of the RMX Association (RMXA), an independent association of RE/MAX franchisees, whose stated goal is to work in partnership with RE/MAX, LLC and each other to improve, enhance and grow the brand into the future and protect assets and grow profitability as franchisees.\nOur financial results are affected directly by the operating results of franchisees and their agents and loan originators who operate independently from our control. Our financial results and the financial results of our franchisees are affected by the ability of our franchisees to attract and retain agents and loan originators.\nOur financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees and, for RE/MAX, their agents and for Motto Mortgage, their loan originators. Our franchise systems provide substantial autonomy to these independent franchisees, more so than is common in other franchised industries such as hospitality. With this autonomy goes the fact that we have little control over their day to day operations. If our franchisees\u2019 financial results worsen, our revenue may decline. We terminate franchisees for non-payment, non-reporting and other non-compliance with their franchise agreements and we may terminate franchisees more frequently in the future.\nOur most important asset is the people in our network. Our financial results and the financial results of our franchisees depend heavily upon the number of RE/MAX agents and Motto offices in our global networks, and the success of our franchisees depends largely on the ability of franchisees to attract and retain high quality agents and loan originators and run profitable businesses. Yet these independent operators may not adopt initiatives and products designed to help them do so, and therefore may not be effective. The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring fees paid by our franchisees or regional franchise owners based on the number of agents or offices within their respective networks and dues paid by RE/MAX agents. If our franchisees are not able to attract and retain loan originators and agents (or successfully manage teams of agents within their brokerage), none of which is within our direct control, our revenue may decline as our franchisees fail to generate the revenue necessary to pay the fees owed to us.\nMost of our RE/MAX franchisees self-report their agent counts and agent commissions which drive the fees due to us, and we have limited tools to validate or verify these reports. This could impact our ability to collect revenue owed to us by our Independent Regions, franchisees, and agents, and could affect our ability to forecast our performance accurately.\nUnder our franchise agreements, franchisees, including Independent Regions, self-report (a) the number of agents and (b) gross commissions and other statistics from home sale transactions. This data is used to determine our billings for continuing franchise fees, annual dues and broker fees. We have limited methods of validating the data and must rely on reports submitted and our internal protocols for verifying the reasonableness of the data. If franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report such data, even if unintentionally, we may not receive all of the revenues due to us. In addition, to the extent that we were underpaid, we may not have a definitive method for determining such underpayment. If a material number of our franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report their agent counts, agent commissions or fees due to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. Further, agent count is a key performance indicator (KPI), and incomplete information, or information that is not reported in a timely manner could impair our ability to evaluate and forecast key business drivers and financial performance.\nWe rely on traffic to our websites, including our flagship websites, remax.com and mottomortgage.com, directed from search engines. If our websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our websites could decline and our business could be adversely affected. Any disruption to our websites or lead generation tools could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract home buyers and sellers to our websites, including our flagship websites, remax.com and mottomortgage.com through unpaid Internet search results on search engines. The number of\nusers we attract from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in ranking algorithms which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. In addition, our website faces increasing competition for audience from real estate portal websites such as Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with websites, which include our lead referral system, remax.com, global.remax.com, theremaxcollection.com, remaxcommercial.com and mottomortgage.com. These risks include changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. We may experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including reliance on our third-party hosted services, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, and denial of service, fraud or attacks. Our failure to address these risks and uncertainties successfully could reduce our Internet presence, generate fewer leads for our agents and damage our brand. Many of the risks relating to our website operations are beyond our control.\nWe rely on third parties for certain important functions and technology. Any failures by those vendors could disrupt our business operations.\nWe have outsourced certain key functions to external parties, including some that are critical to financial reporting, our franchise and membership tracking and billing, the Motto loan origination system, and a number of critical websites. We may enter into other key outsourcing relationships in the future. If one or more of these external parties were not able to perform their functions for a period of time, perform them at an acceptable service level, or handle increased volumes, our business operations could be constrained, disrupted, or otherwise negatively affected. Our ability to monitor the activities or performance of vendors may be constrained, which makes it difficult for us to assess and manage the risks associated with these relationships.\nOur franchisees and their agents or loan originators could take actions that could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur franchisees are independent businesses and as such, the agents and loan originators who work within these brokerages are not our employees and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Franchisees may not operate their real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses consistent with industry standards or may not attract and retain qualified agents and loan originators. If franchisees and agents and loan originators were to provide diminished quality of service to customers, engage in fraud, misconduct, negligence or otherwise violate the law or applicable codes of ethics, our image and reputation may suffer materially and we may become subject to liability claims based upon such actions. Any such incidents could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBrand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies or the ordinary course of our business or our franchisees\u2019 businesses. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control and may damage our brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their agents and loan originators relating to health, safety, cybersecurity, welfare or other matters, litigation and claims, failure to maintain high ethical and social standards for all of our operations and activities, failure to comply with local laws and regulations, and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Our brands values could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us, which may result in a decrease in our total agent and loan office count and, ultimately, lower revenues, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe failure of Independent Region owners to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions could adversely impact our revenue and earnings growth opportunities.\nWe have sold regional master franchises in the U.S. and Canada and have sold and continue to sell regional master franchises in our global locations outside of Canada. While we are pursuing a strategy to reacquire select regional franchise rights, we still rely on independent regional master franchises in Independent Regions. We depend on Independent Regions, which have the exclusive right to grant franchises within a particular region, to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions and to monitor franchisees\u2019 use of our brand. The failure of any of these Independent Region owners to do these things, or the termination of an agreement with a regional master franchisee could delay the development of a particular franchised area, interrupt the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets while we seek alternative methods to develop our franchises in the area, and weaken our brand image. Such an event could result in lower revenue growth opportunities for us, which would adversely impact our growth prospects.\nWe may be unable to reacquire regional franchise rights in RE/MAX Independent Regions or successfully integrate the regions or other businesses once acquired.\nWe continue to pursue a growth strategy of reacquiring select RE/MAX independent regional franchises to support our growth. The acquisition of a regional franchise enables us to focus on a consistent delivery of the RE/MAX value proposition, increases our revenue, and provides an opportunity for us to enhance profitability. This growth strategy depends on our ability to find regional franchisees willing to sell the franchise rights in their regions on favorable terms, as well as our ability to finance, complete and integrate these transactions. The number of remaining Independent Regions is limited so we may have difficulty finding suitable regional franchise acquisition opportunities at an acceptable price. Additionally, we are pursuing a growth strategy of acquiring businesses that complement our existing businesses and enhance our value proposition. It is possible we may not achieve the expected returns on a given acquisition; and we may not be able to deliver expected cost and growth synergies.\nIntegrating acquired businesses involves complex operational and personnel-related challenges and we may encounter unforeseen difficulties and higher than expected integration costs. Delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business could lead to prolonged diversion of management\u2019s attention away from other important business activities.\nAcquisitions may present other challenges and difficulties, including:\n\u25cf the possible departure of a significant number of key employees;\n\u25cf regulatory constraints and costs of executing our growth strategy may vary by geography;\n\u25cf the possible defection of franchisees and agents to other brands or independent real estate companies;\n\u25cf limits on growth due to exclusive territories granted to current franchisees by former region owners;\n\u25cf the failure to maintain important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\n\u25cf for our technology acquisitions, our ability to implement appropriate cybersecurity controls while concurrently enhancing their platforms;\n\u25cf legal or regulatory challenges or litigation post-acquisition, which could result in significant costs;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition.\nSuch litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, securities litigation including class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, complaints from or litigation by franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements and franchising arrangements.\nOur global operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems and reduced protection of\nintellectual property. A substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur franchise model can be subject to particular litigation risks.\nLitigation against a franchisee or its affiliated sales agents by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may also include claims against us for liability by virtue of the franchise relationship. Franchisees may fail to obtain insurance naming the Company as an additional insured on such claims. In addition to increasing franchisees\u2019 costs and limiting the funds available to pay us fees and dues and reducing the execution of new franchise arrangements, claims against us (including vicarious liability claims) divert our management resources and could cause adverse publicity, which may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable.\nIn addition to claims over individual or isolated franchisee actions, third parties could attempt to hold us responsible for actions of our franchisees and their agents in the aggregate. Our franchised business model is unlike a traditional, integrated corporation where company-owned outlets provide goods or services to consumers and the corporation has direct responsibility for operations at those outlets. Our franchised business model is also unlike many franchisors in other industries-such as the restaurant and hospitality industries-where franchisors may dictate many operational details of the franchisees\u2019 businesses and the delivery of goods and services to consumers and thereby have some of the liability for those or other aspects of the franchisees\u2019 operations. Because we franchise in professional service fields where licensure is required-real estate and mortgage brokerage-we do not dictate or control the day to day operations or the advice provided by our franchisees or their affiliated sales associates or loan originators. Nonetheless, third parties may try to hold us liable for actions of our franchisees and their agents or loan originators, even when we have no involvement with those actions and they are beyond our control and, we believe, should not result in liability to us. As a franchisor, unlike an integrated corporation, we obtain in fees only a small portion of the revenue of our franchisees, and as a result our capital is very limited in comparison with the size of our entire franchise networks. Therefore, if third parties were successful in asserting liability for practices of our franchise network in its entirety, and in holding us vicariously responsible for that liability, the resulting damages could exceed our available capital, could materially affect our earnings, or even render us insolvent.\nWe are relatively new to the mortgage brokerage industry and have purchased several businesses outside our core franchising competency. Less mature businesses carry a higher risk of failure.\nWe are pursuing a growth strategy to offer and sell residential mortgage brokerage franchises in the U.S. under the \u201cMotto Mortgage\u201d brand and trademarks. We continue to develop operating experience in the mortgage brokerage industry. Our strategy hinges on our ability to recruit franchisees and help them recruit loan originators, to develop and maintain strong competencies within the mortgage brokerage market, on favorable conditions in the related regulatory environment and on our success in developing a strong, respected brand. We may fail to understand, interpret, implement and/or train franchisees adequately concerning compliance requirements related to the mortgage brokerage industry or the relationship between us and our franchisees, any of which failures could subject us or our franchisees to adverse actions from regulators. Motto Franchising, LLC, may also have regulatory obligations arising from its relationship with Motto franchisees; we may fail to comply with those obligations, and that failure could also subject us to adverse actions from regulators. The Motto Mortgage brand\u2019s lack of brand recognition may hamper franchise sales efforts. In addition, residential mortgage brokerage is a highly competitive industry and Motto will suffer if we are unable to attract franchisees.\nAcquisitions we have made outside our core franchising competency, including booj, First, Gadberry and wemlo present new challenges that, should we fail to understand or address, could result in not achieving the expected financial results of these acquisitions, including for many of them failing to result in improved agent and franchisee acquisition and retention. Those acquisitions that are recent startups carry the additional risk of not having a track record of success.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. Infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business.\nRE/MAX is a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and the Motto brand is gaining recognition. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the RE/MAX brand, as well as our newer brands such as Motto and wemlo is critical to growing our business. If we do not successfully build and maintain strong brands, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe derive significant benefit from our market share leadership and our ability to make claims regarding the same, including through use of our slogan that \u201cNobody in the world sells more real estate than RE/MAX\u201d as measured by residential transaction sides. Loss of market leadership, and as a result an inability to tout the same, may hinder public and industry perception of RE/MAX as a leader in the real estate market and hurt agent recruitment and franchise sales as a result.\nInasmuch as our business is in part dependent on strong brands, our business may be subject to risks related to events and circumstances that have a negative impact on our brands. If we are exposed to adverse publicity or events that do damage to our brands image, our business may suffer material adverse effects from the deterioration in our brand image.\nWe regard our RE/MAX trademark, balloon logo and yard sign design trademarks and our Motto trademarks as valuable assets and important factors in the marketing of our brands. We believe that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. Not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nWe are commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce our intellectual property and protect our brands. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks, including uses that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of our brands and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively.\nIn addition, franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements and our brand standards may reduce the overall goodwill of our brands, whether through diminished consumer perception of our brands, dilution of our intellectual property, the failure to meet the FTC guidelines or applicable state laws, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices.\nOur global RE/MAX operations, including those in Canada, are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\nThe risks involved in our global operations and relationships could result in losses against which we are not insured and therefore affect our profitability. These risks include:\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to changes in the Canadian dollar and Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates;\n\u25cf exposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the agents of our franchisees;\n\u25cf economic and/or credit conditions abroad;\n\u25cf potential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S.;\n\u25cf restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u25cf government policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u25cf diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u25cf withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf changes in tax laws regarding taxation of foreign profits.\nAttrition of legacy booj customers could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe booj business we acquired in February 2018 continues to service legacy customers, unrelated to RE/MAX. Many legacy customers have discontinued their relationship with booj, causing revenue to decrease. There is a risk that the remaining legacy customers leave at a faster pace than anticipated resulting in an accelerating decline in revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe real estate market may be negatively impacted by industry changes as the result of certain class action lawsuits.\nAs disclosed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, we are a defendant in class action complaints referred to as the \u201cMoehrl-related suits\u201d which allege violations of federal antitrust law. The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) also agreed to settle a suit with the National Association of Realtors (\u201cNAR\u201d) in which NAR agreed to adopt certain rule changes, such as increased disclosure of commission offers from sellers\u2019 agents to buyers\u2019 agents, but the direct and indirect effects, if any, of the settlement upon the real estate industry are not yet entirely clear. Moreover, the Moehrl-related suits seek additional changes in real estate industry practices beyond the changes NAR agreed to in the DOJ settlement. Further, these lawsuits have prompted discussion of regulatory changes to rules established by local or state real estate boards or multiple listing services. Although the settlement between NAR and the DOJ does not require changes to agent and broker compensation, the resolution of the Moehrl-related suits and/or other regulatory changes may require changes to our or our brokers\u2019 business models, including changes in agent and broker compensation. This could reduce the fees we receive from our franchisees, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results are tied to the residential real estate market and we may be negatively impacted by downturns in this market.\nThe residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic conditions which are beyond our control. These conditions include fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, wage and job growth, unemployment, home affordability, down payment requirements, inventory, consumer confidence, demographic changes, local or regional economic conditions and the general condition of the U.S., Canadian and global economies. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the residential real estate market. The residential real estate market could also be negatively impacted by acts of nature, such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and such events may lead us to waive fees in certain impacted areas. Climate change may negatively affect the residential real estate market. Changes in local, state and federal laws or regulations that affect residential real estate transactions or encourage ownership, and potential future tax law changes could negatively impact the residential real estate market.\nAny of the above factors, and other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause a decline in the housing or mortgage markets and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or home prices. This could lead to a decrease of the number of agents or franchises in our networks and reduce the fees we receive from our franchisees and agents, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in the residential real estate franchising business is intense, and we may be unable to grow our business organically, including increasing our agent count, expanding our network of franchises and their agents, and increasing franchise and agent fees, which could adversely affect our brand, our financial performance, and results of operations.\nWe generally face strong competition in the residential real estate services business from other franchisors and brokerages (i.e. national, regional, independent, boutique, discount and web-based brokerages). We also face competition from web-based companies focused on real estate that have made substantial investments in innovative technology aimed at disrupting the real estate market and making more aspects of the real estate industry digital.\nUpon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to renew their franchise with us, operate as an independent broker or to franchise with one of our competitors. Competing franchisors may offer franchisees fees that are lower than those we charge, or that are more attractive in particular markets. Further, some of our largest competitors may have greater financial resources and larger budgets than we do to invest in technology and enhance their value proposition to agents, brokers and consumers. To remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees at the time of the renewal of their franchise agreements, we may have to reduce the cost of renewals and/or the recurring monthly fees we charge our franchisees. We may have to offer incentives to encourage franchisees to\nrecruit new agents and successfully manage teams of agents. In addition, even with these measures, franchisees may choose not to renew their franchise, or may not recruit new agents.\nAs a result of this competition, we may face many challenges in adding franchises and attracting agents in new and existing markets to expand our network, as well as other challenges such as:\n\u25cf selection and availability of suitable markets;\n\u25cf finding qualified franchisees in these markets who are interested in opening franchises on terms that are favorable to us;\n\u25cf increasing our local brand awareness in new markets; and\n\u25cf attracting and training of qualified local agents.\nA significant adoption by consumers of alternatives to full-service agents or loan originators could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nA significant increase in consumer use of technology that eliminates or minimizes the role of the real estate agent or mortgage loan originator could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations. These options include direct-buyer companies (also called iBuyers) that purchase homes directly from sellers at below-market rates in exchange for speed and convenience, and then resell them shortly thereafter at market prices, and discounters who reduce the role of the agent in order to offer sellers a low commission or a flat fee while giving rebates to buyers. How consumers want to buy or sell houses and finance their purchase will determine if these models reduce or replace the long-standing preference for full-service agents and loan originators.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations due to home sales, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nHistorically, we have realized, and expect to continue to realize, lower profitability in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue primarily as a result of lower overall home sale transactions, and higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with our RE/MAX annual convention. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, which would cause period to period comparisons of our operating results to not be necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future annual performance.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Capital Structure\nRIHI has substantial influence over us including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and its interest in our business may conflict with yours.\nRIHI, a company controlled by David Liniger, our current Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder, respectively, owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock. Although RIHI no longer controls a majority of the voting power of RE/MAX Holdings\u2019 common stock, RIHI remains a significant stockholder of the Company and through its ownership of the Class B common stock and holds 40.6% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s stock. Mr. Liniger also personally owns Class A common stock with an additional 1.1% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s stock. Therefore, RIHI has the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nIn addition, RIHI\u2019s entire economic interest in us is in the form of its direct interest in RMCO through the ownership of RMCO common units, the payments it may receive from us under its tax receivable agreement and the proceeds it may receive upon any redemption of its RMCO common units, including issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, upon any such redemption and any subsequent sale of such Class A common stock. As a result, RIHI\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of our Class A common stockholders. For example, RIHI may have a different tax position from us which could influence its decisions regarding certain transactions, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreements, including whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, RIHI could have an interest in the structuring of future transactions to take into consideration its tax or other considerations, even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nOur tax receivable agreements require us to make cash payments based upon future tax benefits to which we may become entitled. The amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant, may be accelerated in certain circumstances and could significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into tax receivable agreements that are currently held by RIHI and Parallaxes Rain Co-Investment, LLC (\u201cParallaxes\u201d and together, the \u201cTRA Parties\u201d). The amount of the cash payments that we may be\nrequired to make under the tax receivable agreements could be significant and will depend, in part, upon facts and circumstances that are beyond our control.\nThe tax receivable agreements provide that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, or that if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreements, then our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the tax receivable agreements would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements.\nAs a result, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Parties that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreements early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreements, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.\nWe will also not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Parties (or their predecessors) pursuant to the tax receivable agreements if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to either of the TRA Parties will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreements. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to either of the TRA Parties for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the tax receivable agreements that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nWe have significant debt service obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nWe have significant debt service obligations, including principal, interest and commitment fee payments due quarterly pursuant to RE/MAX, LLC\u2019s Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our currently existing indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue additional equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Future indebtedness may impose additional restrictions on us, which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our Class A common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u25cf provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf delegate the sole power to a majority of our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u25cf provide the power of our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, except that David and Gail Liniger are\ndeemed to have been approved by our Board of Directors, and thereby not subject to these restrictions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations\nFinancing for homebuyers in the U.S. is highly regulated and a lack of residential real estate market financing at favorable rates and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur business is significantly impacted by the availability of financing at favorable rates or on favorable terms for homebuyers, which may be affected by government regulations and policies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to more closely regulate the financial services industry by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), an independent federal bureau, which was designed to enforce consumer protection laws, including various laws regulating mortgage finance. The Dodd-Frank Act also established new standards and practices for mortgage lending, including a requirement to determine a prospective borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, removing perceived incentives to originate higher cost mortgages, requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect. Rules implementing many of these changes protect creditors from certain liabilities for loans that meet the requirements for \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d (\u201cQM loans\u201d). The rules placed several restrictions on qualified mortgages, including caps on certain closing costs as well as limits on debt to income (\u201cDTI\u201d) ratios for qualified mortgages.\nCertain potential regulatory changes such as the termination by the CFPB of a regulatory exemption known as the \u201cQM patch\u201d for loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the requirement to implement a new uniform residential loan application (\u201cURLA\u201d) which may increase Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d) and other operational risks, and more activist supervision and regulation of housing finance at the state level may adversely impact the housing industry, including homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes.\nThe monetary policy of the U.S. government, and particularly the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., significantly affects the availability of financing at favorable rates and on favorable terms, which in turn affects the domestic real estate market. Changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies are beyond our control, are difficult to predict, and could restrict the availability of financing on reasonable terms at favorable interest rates for homebuyers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, a reduction in government support for home financing, including the possible winding down or privatization of GSEs could further reduce the availability of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market. No consensus has emerged in Congress concerning potential reforms relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a potential transition to alternative structures for the secondary market, so we cannot predict either the short or long term-effects of such regulation and its impact on homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes.\nLenders may from time to time tighten their underwriting standards or cease to offer subprime and other alternative mortgage products in the marketplace. If mortgage loans are difficult to obtain, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes could be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate all aspects of legislation, regulations and policies affecting the domestic real estate market, we cannot predict whether or not such legislation, regulation and policies may increase down payment requirements, increase mortgage costs, or result in increased costs and potential litigation for housing market participants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur franchising activities are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations regarding franchises, and any failure to comply with such existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have \u201cfranchise relationship laws\u201d or \u201cbusiness opportunity laws\u201d that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. We believe that our franchising procedures, as well as any applicable state-specific procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise\narrangements. However, noncompliance could reduce anticipated revenue, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe real estate business is highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and are subject to requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the jurisdictions in which they do business.\nOur franchisees must comply with RESPA. RESPA and comparable state statutes, among other things, restrict payments which real estate brokers, agents, mortgage brokers, loan originators and other settlement service providers may receive for the referral of business to other settlement service providers in connection with the closing of real estate transactions. Such laws may to some extent restrict preferred vendor arrangements involving our franchisees. RESPA and similar state laws also require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests that a broker has with providers of real estate settlement services.\nThere is a risk that we and our franchisees could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nWe, or our franchisees, are also subject to various other rules and regulations such as:\n\u25cf the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information;\n\u25cf the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and various other laws protecting consumer data;\n\u25cf the USA PATRIOT Act;\n\u25cf restrictions on transactions with persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury;\n\u25cf federal and state \u201cDo Not Call,\u201d \u201cDo Not Fax,\u201d and \u201cDo Not E-Mail\u201d laws;\n\u25cf the Fair Housing Act;\n\u25cf laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impose sanctions on improper payments;\n\u25cf laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business;\n\u25cf state and federal employment laws and regulations, including any changes that would require reclassification of independent contractors to employee status, and wage and hour regulations; and\n\u25cf consumer fraud statutes.\nOur or our franchisees\u2019 failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nGeneral Risks\nCyberattacks, security breaches and improper access to, disclosure or deletion of our data, personally identifiable information we collect, or business records could harm our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur information technologies and systems and those of our third-party hosted services are vulnerable to breach, damage or interruption from various causes, including: (i) natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism, (ii) power losses, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses and corruption of data, and similar events, and (iii) employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Of particular risk and focus in recent years is the potential penetration of internal or outsourced systems by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information (aka, cyberattacks). Cyberattacks, including the use of phishing and malware, continue to grow in sophistication making it impossible for us to mitigate all of these risks. Any extended interruption of our systems or exposure of sensitive data to third parties could cause significant damage to our business or our brand, for which our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nIn addition, we rely on the collection and use of personally identifiable information from franchisees, agents and consumers to conduct our business and in certain instances such data may include social security numbers, payment\ncard numbers, or customer financial information. Global privacy legislation (including the GDPR regulations in the European Union), enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. Changes in these laws may limit our data access, use, and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and requires covered businesses to, among other things, provide disclosures to California consumers regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such consumers\u2019 personal information and afford such consumers new rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information. We believe that further increased regulation in additional jurisdictions is likely in the area of data privacy. Should we misuse or improperly store the personally identifiable information that we collect, or should we be the victim of a cyberattack that results in improper access to such personally identifiable information, we may be subject to legal claims and regulatory scrutiny. Any legal claims, government action or damage to our reputation due to actions, or the perception that we are taking actions, inconsistent with the terms of our privacy statement, consumer expectations, or privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, could expose us to liability and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused and will likely continue to cause significant disruption to our normal business operations, and the severity and duration of these impacts on future financial performance and results of operations remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is impacting economic activity worldwide. The pandemic poses significant risks to our business and our employees, franchisees, agents, and loan originators.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business and that of our franchisees. The pandemic poses the risk of an extended disruption to our business, that of our franchisees and other business partners, and housing and mortgage markets generally, due to the impact of the disease itself, actions intended to limit or slow its spread, and other factors. These include restrictions on travel or transportation, social distancing requirements, limitations on the size of gatherings, policies that ban or severely limit in-person showings of properties, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, curtailing other activities, quarantines and lock-downs.\nDisruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a downturn in the residential real estate and mortgage markets and future developments related to COVID-19 may cause further disruptions to the economy and real estate and mortgage markets that may negatively impact our business. Such disruptions may include a downturn in economic conditions generally, declines in consumer confidence and spending, and tightening of credit or instability in the financial markets. These same factors may impair the ability of our franchisees (a) to continue their operations resulting in larger numbers of failures and (b) to pay the fees that are due to us under their franchise agreements. We provided financial support to our franchisees during this time, which resulted in a decline in our revenues in 2020. We are unable to estimate the effectiveness of that support on the ongoing financial health and stability of our franchisees, whether we will determine to offer support in future periods as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, or the ultimate effect of such support on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNearly all of the Company\u2019s employees are currently working remotely and may continue to do so for an undetermined amount of time. This may impair the ability of the Company\u2019s management team to successfully implement the Company\u2019s business plans. We cannot predict when or how we will begin to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans, including work from home requirements and travel restrictions.\nThe duration and magnitude of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be predicted at this time. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business and the overall economy as a whole throughout the world, including in the United States and Canada. In particular, there is significant concern regarding the possibility of additional waves of COVID-19 cases that could cause state and local governments to reinstate more restrictive measures, which could impact our business and housing markets. There is also uncertainty regarding how the housing market will respond to any reduction in the health risks relating to COVID-19 in the future for example as a result of viable treatment options or a vaccine including the uncertainty surrounding the speed of rollout and efficacy of any treatments or vaccines.\nThe Company has experienced significant disruption to its business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and such disruptions may continue, particularly if ongoing mitigation actions by government authorities remain in place for a significant amount of time. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and financial condition is unknown, and its impact may be variable over time as government regulations, market conditions and consumer behavior changes in response to developments with respect to the pandemic. Notwithstanding any mitigation actions, sustained material revenue declines relating to this crisis could impact our financial condition, results of operations, stock price and ability to access the capital markets. Substantial declines in our profitability could trigger the excess cash flow requirements of our Senior Secured Credit Facility (described [above in Item 2)] requiring us to make incremental principal payments that would not otherwise be required.\nThe pandemic and any severe or long-term economic downturn in the housing market or long-term mitigation efforts by government authorities could heighten other important risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, (i) changes in the real estate market or interest rates and availability of financing for homebuyers, (ii) changes in business and economic activity in general, (iii) the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain quality franchisees, (iv) the Company\u2019s franchisees\u2019 ability to recruit and retain real estate agents and mortgage loan originators and their ability to continue as a going concern, (v) changes in laws and regulations, (vi) adverse legal interpretations of contractual provisions within our franchise agreements, (vii) the Company\u2019s ability to enhance, market, and protect the RE/MAX and Motto Mortgage brands, (viii) the Company\u2019s ability to implement its technology initiatives, (ix) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and (x) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain any required additional financing in the future on acceptable terms or at all.\nExpectations of the Company relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors. Some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of corporate responsibility performance. The criteria by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental, social and governance matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 14221, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RMAX"}
