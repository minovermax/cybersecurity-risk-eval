{"cik": "1171662", "company": "TRIPLE-S MANAGEMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe must deal with several risk factors during the normal course of business. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed insignificant may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWhile we consider the foregoing to be the overarching risks we face in 2019, they are not the only material risks we face. We face numerous other challenges, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, including below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussion, and other unanticipated risks may develop.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur inability to contain managed care costs may adversely affect our business and profitability.\nA substantial portion of our managed care revenue is generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per member that are established by contracts with our commercial customers, ASES or CMS (for our Medicare Advantage plans), all of which are typically renewable on an annual basis. If our medical expenses exceed our estimates, except in very limited circumstances or as a result of risk score adjustments for member acuity in the case of the Medicare Advantage products, we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then-current terms. As a result, our profitability in any year depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of managed care services through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Also, we have in the past and may in the future enter into new lines of business in which it may be difficult to estimate anticipated costs. Numerous factors affecting the cost of managed care, including changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies such as genetic laboratory screening for diseases including breast cancer, electronic recordkeeping, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment including the implementation of ACA, may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage managed care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntroduction of new high cost specialty drugs and sudden costs spikes for existing drugs increase the risk that the pharmacy cost assumptions used to develop our rates are not adequate to cover the actual pharmacy costs, which jeopardizes the overall actuarial soundness of our rates. Bearing the high costs of new specialty drugs or the high cost inflation of generic drugs without an appropriate rate adjustment or other reimbursement mechanism adversely impacts our financial conditional and operational results. In addition, evolving state and federal regulation may impact the ability of our health plans to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members. Other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include, but are not limited to, geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals, and changes in discounts. Although we will continue to work with state agencies in an effort to ensure that we receive appropriate and actuarially sound reimbursement for all new drug therapies and pharmaceuticals trends, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our current provider agreements and to enter into other appropriate agreements.\nOur profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other managed care providers. In recent years some groups of providers have been pressing for legislation that would allow them to collectively negotiate certain contract terms through cooperatives. As a result, Puerto Rico enacted legislation authorizing providers to collectively negotiate the services fees through cooperatives, on a voluntary basis, with health insurance companies and other healthcare-related organizations. This legislation requires that the Public Corporation for the Supervision and Insurance of Cooperatives adopt regulation that may have a material adverse effect in our business. If collective negotiations with providers become mandatory or we are otherwise required to enter into collective negotiations with providers, it could become more difficult to maintain cost-effective managed care provider contracts, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on a small number of government contracts to generate a significant amount of the revenues of our Managed Care segment.\nOur managed care business participates in government contracts that generate a significant amount of our consolidated operating revenues, including:\n\u2022 Commercial: One of our Managed Care subsidiaries is a qualified contractor to provide managed care coverage to federal government employees within Puerto Rico. Such coverage is provided pursuant to a contract with the OPM that is subject to termination in the event of non-compliance not corrected to the satisfaction of the OPM. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 premiums generated under this contract represented 5.3%, 5.5%, and 5.7% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\nUnder the commercial business, we also provide health coverage to certain employees of the Government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, earned premium revenue related to such health plans represented 2.2%, 3.0%, and 3.4% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\n\u2022 Medicare: We provide services through our Medicare Advantage products pursuant to a limited number of contracts with CMS. These contracts generally have terms of one year and must be renewed each year. Each of our contracts with CMS is cancellable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. If we are unable to renew, or to successfully re-bid or compete for any of these contracts, or if the process for bidding materially changes or if any of these contracts are terminated, our business could be materially impaired. During each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, contracts with CMS represented 43.3%, 38.5%, and 36.6% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\n\u2022 Medicaid: We participate in the government of Puerto Rico Health Reform Program (similar to Medicaid), known as Vital (\u201cVital\u201d), to provide health coverage to medically indigent citizens in Puerto Rico. The current agreement, which became effective November 1, 2018, requires MCOs to serve subscribers on an island-wide basis, rather than assigning each MCO to specific regions, as under the previous model. The term of the agreement ends on September 30, 2021, which may be extended for an additional year at ASES\u2019s option. Under the current agreement, TSS is responsible for providing medical, mental, pharmacy and dental healthcare services on an at-risk basis to subscribers who enroll with TSS. ASES pays TSS a per member per month rate that varies depending on the particular clinical condition or category of the subscriber. Premium rates will be negotiated for each contract year. Participants may change insurance carriers once every year. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our Medicaid membership was approximately 355,000 and 319,000 members, respectively. Under the previous agreement with ASES, we provided services to eligible members in the Metro North and West regions of Puerto Rico. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 Medicaid premiums generated through our agreements with ASES represented 26.5%, 26.4% and 26.6%, respectively.\nIf any of these contracts is terminated for any reason, including by reason of any non-compliance by us, or not renewed or replaced by a comparable contract, our consolidated premiums and profitability earned could be materially adversely affected. See also \u201cRisks Relating to the Regulation of our Industry-As a Medicare Advantage program participant, we are subject to complex regulations.\u201d\nA change in our managed care commercial product mix may impact our profitability.\nOur managed care products that involve greater potential risk, such as fully insured arrangements, generally tend to be more profitable than ASO products and those managed care products where employer groups retain the risk, such as self-funded financial arrangements. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 73% and 69% of our managed care commercial customers, respectively, had fully-insured arrangements and 27% and 31%, respectively, had ASO arrangements. Unfavorable changes in the relative profitability or customer participation among our various products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported claims would affect our reported financial results.\nA portion of the claim liabilities recorded by our insurance segments represents an estimate of amounts needed to pay and adjust anticipated claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. These amounts are based on estimates of the ultimate expected cost of claims and on actuarial estimation techniques. Judgment is required in actuarial estimation to ascertain the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under each segment\u2019s current facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided. We regularly compare prior period liabilities to re-estimate claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development; any difference between these amounts is adjusted in the operations of the period determined. Additional information on how each reportable segment determines its claim liabilities, and the variables considered in the development of this amount, is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d. Actual experience will likely differ from assumed experience, and to the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe termination or modification of our license agreements to use the BCBS name and mark could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive use of the BCBS name and mark in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. These license agreements contain certain standards, requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS name and mark which may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. Changes to the terms of our license agreements may restrict various potential business activities. Failure to comply with the standards, requirements and restrictions established could result in the termination of a license agreement. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. Upon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a re-establishment fee upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to entitle another managed care company to use the BCBS name and marks in the service areas we currently serve. This re-establishment fee is currently $98.33 per licensed enrollee. If the re-establishment fee were applied to our total BCBS enrollees as of December 31, 2019, we would be assessed approximately $91.0 million by the BCBSA.\nWe believe that the BCBS name and mark are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Termination of these license agreements, including modifications to the current term and conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Blue Cross and Blue Shield License\u201d for more information.\nOur ability to manage our exposure to underwriting risks in our Life and Property and Casualty segments depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance coverage.\nReinsurance is the practice of transferring part of an insurance company\u2019s liability and premium under an insurance policy to another insurance company. We use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain, to stabilize our underwriting results and to increase our underwriting capacity. During 2019, 34.8%, or $52.3 million, of the premiums written in the Property and Casualty segment and 4.4%, or $8.3 million, of the premiums written in the Life segment were ceded to reinsurers. Total premiums ceded, on a consolidated basis, represent 2.0%, or $66.3 million of our premiums. The premiums ceded and the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to changing market conditions and may vary significantly over time. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance coverage will increase our risk of loss. We may be unable to maintain our desired reinsurance coverage or obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or obtain new coverage, it will be difficult for us to manage our underwriting risks and operate our business profitably.\nIt is also possible that the losses we experience on insured risks for which we have obtained reinsurance will exceed the coverage limits of the reinsurance. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-Large scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d If the amount of our reinsurance coverage is insufficient, our insurance losses could increase substantially.\nIf our reinsurers do not pay our claims or do not pay them in a timely manner, we may incur losses.\nWe are subject to loss and credit risk with respect to the reinsurers with whom we deal. In accordance with general industry practices, our Property and Casualty and Life subsidiaries annually purchase reinsurance to lessen the impact of large unforeseen losses and mitigate sudden and unpredictable changes in our net income and shareholders\u2019 equity. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. In the event that all or any of the reinsurance companies are unable to meet their obligations under existing reinsurance agreements or pay on a timely basis, we will continue to be liable to our policyholders notwithstanding such defaults or delays. If our reinsurers are not capable of fulfilling their financial obligations to us, our insurance losses would increase, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our A.M. Best rating could affect our ability to write new business or renew our existing business in our Property and Casualty segment.\nRatings assigned by A.M. Best are an important factor influencing the competitive position of the property and casualty insurance companies in Puerto Rico. In May 2019, A.M. Best affirmed its November 2018 downgrade of the rating of our Property and Casualty subsidiary from an \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) to a \u201cB+\u201d (Good). The rating revision follows the losses related to Hurricane Maria losses experienced by this segment during the second and third quarters of 2018.\nA.M. Best ratings represent independent opinions of financial strength and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Financial strength ratings are used by brokers and customers as a means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. A.M. Best reviews its ratings periodically and we may be further downgraded following their annual evaluation. Since the lines of business that this segment writes and the market in which it operates are particularly sensitive to changes in A.M. Best financial strength ratings, any further downgrade of our Property and Casualty segment\u2019s rating could limit or prevent us from writing and renewing certain types of business or accounts that requires insurers with stronger ratings.\nWe are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions, including PBM services.\nWe contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems. Certain of these third parties provide us with significant portions of our business infrastructure and operating requirements, and we could become overly dependent on key vendors, which could cause us to lose core competencies. We are also dependent on some third parties for certain regulatory compliance-related matters. A termination of our agreements with, or disruption in the performance of, one or more of these service providers could result in service disruptions or unavailability, reduced service quality and effectiveness, increased or duplicative costs, fines or corrective action plans imposed by our regulators, or an inability to meet our obligations to our customers. In addition, we may also have to seek alternative service providers, which may be unavailable or only available on less favorable contract terms. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, reputation, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nTSS has a Master Services Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) with OptumInsight, Inc. (\u201cOptum\u201d), pursuant to which Optum provides healthcare technology and operations services, including information technology, claims processing and application development, to Triple-S and its affiliates. As a result, we are dependent on Optum for the provision of essential services to our business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that Optum will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary claims processing and technology services. Potential breakdowns or failures of Optum could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTSS consolidated PBM services for its Medicare Advantage and Commercial lines of business through an agreement with Abarca Health, effective January 2019. As a result of this consolidation, any issues or failures affecting this vendor could have an impact on a significant portion of our managed care business, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nSignificant competition and market conditions in Puerto Rico could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nWe are subject to strong competition in each line of business in which we operate. Competition in the insurance industry is based on many factors, including premiums charged, services provided, speed of claim payments and reputation. This competitive environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures in our profitability. The industry in which we operate has unique characteristics that, if we are unable to manage adequately, may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Some of the trends and characteristics related to the competition we face in our different lines of business include the following:\nThe managed care market in Puerto Rico is mature. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Puerto Rico\u2019s population decreased by 2.2% between 2000 and 2010; however, the national population rate grew 9.7% during the same period. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the older population is an important and growing segment of the United States population. Between 2000 and 2010, the population 65 years and older increased at a faster rate (15.1%) than the total U.S. population. In Puerto Rico, for the same period, the population 65 years and older increased by 27.5 %. As a result, the competition for this segment of the market is significant.\nLocal economy is in a downturn. A challenging economy and a shrinking population in Puerto Rico continue to produce conditions that are adverse to the generation of new sources of business in this segment. As a result, insurance companies compete for the same customers through pricing, policy terms and quality of services. Also, our industry is subject to aggressive marketing and sales practices that target our current and prospective customers. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining our customers. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-Our business is geographically concentrated in Puerto Rico and weakness in the economy and the fiscal health of the government has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\u201d\nOur industry is highly regulated. Future legislation at the federal and local levels may also result in increased competition, especially in the Managed Care segment. While we do not anticipate that any of the current legislative proposals of which we are aware would increase the competition we face, future legislative proposals, if enacted, might do so.\nMarket concentration. Concentration in our industry has created an increasingly competitive environment, both for customers and for potential acquisition targets, which may make it difficult for us to grow our business. The parent companies of some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We may have difficulty competing with larger companies, which can create downward price pressures on premium rates.\nWe believe these trends will continue. There can be no assurance that these competitive pressures will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, we are largely dependent on rental payments, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries, although the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance, including maintenance of minimum levels of capital, as well as covenant restrictions in their indebtedness.\nWe are a holding company whose assets include, among other things, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiaries, including our regulated insurance subsidiaries. We principally rely on rental income and dividends from our subsidiaries to fund our debt service, dividend payments and operating expenses, although our subsidiaries may not declare dividends every year. We also benefit to a lesser extent from income on our investment portfolio.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance requiring, among other things, to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital requirements. Our failure to meet these standards could subject us to regulatory actions.\u201d Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, if any, and other business and legal restrictions. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries have a superior claim to such subsidiaries\u2019 assets. Our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or otherwise contribute or distribute funds to us in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations. In addition, from time to time, we may find it necessary to provide financial assistance, either through subordinated loans or capital infusions to our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nResults of companies in the insurance industry, historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The industry\u2019s profitability can be affected significantly by\n\u2022 rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;\n\u2022 volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made and natural catastrophes;\n\u2022 changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers\u2019 liability develop; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the insurance industry has fluctuated in cyclical periods of low premium rates and excess underwriting capacity resulting from increased competition, followed by periods of high premium rates and a shortage of underwriting capacity resulting from decreased competition. Fluctuations in underwriting capacity, demand and competition, and the impact on us of the other factors identified above, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe that underwriting capacity and price competition in the current market is increasing. This additional underwriting capacity may result in increased competition from other insurers seeking to expand the kinds or amounts of business they write or cause some insurers to seek to maintain market share at the expense of underwriting discipline. We may not be able to retain or attract customers in the future at prices we consider adequate.\nOur investment portfolios are subject to varying economic and market conditions.\nWe have exposure to market risk and credit risk in our investment activities. The fair values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. Fixed maturity securities expose us to interest rate risk as well as credit risk. Equity securities expose us to equity price risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. These and other factors also affect the equity securities owned by us. The outlook of our investment portfolio depends on the future direction of interest rates, fluctuations in the equity markets and the amount of cash flows available for investment. For additional information, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for an analysis of our exposure to interest and equity price risks and the procedures in place to manage these risks. Our investment portfolios may lose money in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to local laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed income securities, equities, and private market investments, among others, which could generate higher returns on our investments. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, any investments exceeding regulatory limitations would be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital.\nThe securities and credit markets could experience extreme volatility and disruption.\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets could significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, other investments, our profitability and our financial position.\nAs an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that is comprised particularly of debt and equity securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S. financial markets, volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments\u2019 monetary policy. These factors can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our profitability and/or our financial position by:\n\u2022 Significantly reducing the value of the debt and equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and creating net unrealized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or net realized capital losses in the event we are required to sell some of those investments.\n\u2022 Lowering interest rates on high quality short-term debt securities and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results.\n\u2022 Making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\u2022 Reducing our ability to issue other securities.\nWe evaluate our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. It also requires us to make certain assessments about the potential recovery of the assets we hold. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities is based upon specific identification.\nWe believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under credit agreement, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of credit.\nFor additional information, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for an analysis of our exposure to interest and equity price risks and the procedures in place to manage these risks. Our investment portfolios may lose money in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nNotwithstanding, the Insurance Code of Puerto Rico requires insurers to invest an amount equal to no less than half of the insurer\u2019s required capital in Puerto Rico Securities. Since February 2014, the credit ratings of bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico and most of Puerto Rico public corporations have been downgraded to below-investment grade, which makes it difficult to comply with this requirement. We therefore requested and obtained a waiver authorization from the Commissioner of Insurance to fulfill the requirement by investing in mortgage securities issued by Ginnie Mae, backed by mortgages issued in Puerto Rico for 2019, and have requested an extension of this waiver for 2020. These securities are of high credit quality due to the Ginnie Mae guarantee.\nIf we fail to comply with the Insurance Code requirements, any investments exceeding regulatory limitations would be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is geographically concentrated in Puerto Rico and weakness in the economy and the fiscal health of the government has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nOur principal lines of business are concentrated in Puerto Rico, which is currently in the midst of a severe fiscal and economic crisis. Puerto Rico\u2019s gross national product (\u201cGNP\u201d) has contracted in real terms since fiscal year 2006. However, the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board estimates, released in June 2019, project Puerto Rico\u2019s GNP to increase by 2% and 3.6% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively. The government of Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Plan (as hereinafter defined), estimates an 4.7% contraction in real GNP during fiscal year 2018. It also projects that disaster relief funding will have a short-term stimulative effect on Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, which, combined with the estimated effects of the proposed measures and reforms, the plan estimates will result in variable GNP growth from fiscal years 2019 through 2022, followed by GNP contraction in fiscal year 2023 as disaster relief funding decreases. The Fiscal Plan, however, does not account for the impact, if any, of the recent earthquakes.\nFurthermore, Puerto Rico\u2019s population has been in decline over the past decade. The most recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate the population has dropped by 14.3%, or approximately 530,000 people, from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019.\nThe weakness of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has also adversely affected employment. Total average annual employment, as measured by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources (the \u201cDLHR\u201d) has decreased approximately 20% since 2007. The reduction in total employment began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, when total employment was 1,244,425, and continued consistently until the first half of fiscal year 2015, after which it mostly stabilized. According to the most recent date from DLHR, dated December 2019, Puerto Rico\u2019s average total employment during calendar year 2019 was approximately 987,000, a slight increase from average total employment of approximately 986,000 during calendar year 2018. The DLHR also reports an average unemployment rate of approximately 8.2% in year 2019, a 1% decrease from an average unemployment rate of approximately 9.2% in calendar year 2018.\nIn response to Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal and financial challenges, the U.S. Congress enacted PROMESA in June 2016. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring their debts through the mechanisms provided by PROMESA. On February 9, 2020, the Oversight Board announced it had reached an agreement with certain creditors on a new framework for a plan of adjustment for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities. While the Puerto Rico government does not support the agreement in its current form and the agreement may suffer significant changes before confirmation, it provides a preliminary framework for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to exit bankruptcy.\nPursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has certified fiscal plans for the government of Puerto Rico and several of its instrumentalities. The most recent fiscal plan was certified by the Oversight Board on May 9, 2019 (the \u201cFiscal Plan\u201d). The Fiscal Plan outlines a number of structural reforms and fiscal measures that the Oversight Board deems necessary to improve the Government of Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal balance and economic condition.\nWe have significant direct exposure to the government through our contract with ASES, which administers the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico, and certain other business relationships with the government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. As a result, we may be adversely affected by the liquidity problems of such entities, or by a reduction in the size of the government or privatization of public corporations. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the reductions in public corporations\u2019 health plan contributions to employees contemplated in Act 26 will be implemented, how they will be implemented, and what effect such reductions will have in our business.\nOn the other hand, as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program will receive up to approximately $5.342 billion in funding through September 30, 2021. This action has brought temporary financial stability to Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program, and funding conditions related to compliance with program management standards have further promoted stability and predictability. The government of Puerto Rico and the health care industry are lobbying Congress to address Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid spending cliff permanently: however, there are no guarantees that these efforts will succeed. If our efforts are not successful, ASES may not be able to fulfill its payment obligations to us under our agreement for the provision of health coverage to Vital participants, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nFurthermore, our insureds\u2019 financial capacity is affected by, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected as a decrease in insured customers in our commercial line of business and premiums earned, net. Moreover, the measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the near future, will likely affect many of our insureds, which could result in a lower amount of insureds, insureds moving to lower premium plans, among others. The foregoing could also result in decreased demand for our insurance products or migration to less profitable products.\nIf global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal and economic challenges, including consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, the conditions described above could continue or worsen in ways that are unpredictable and outside of our control. While PROMESA provides the government with tools to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s debt obligations and that of its instrumentalities, these restructuring tools are new and untested. Furthermore, the Fiscal Plan\u2019s projections indicate the possibility of significant creditor losses. Both of these factors may make any debt restructuring process a lengthy and highly adversarial process.\nThe success of our business depends on developing and maintaining effective information systems.\nOur business and operations may be affected if we do not maintain and upgrade our information systems and the integrity of our proprietary information. We are materially dependent on our information systems, including Internet-enabled products and information, for all aspects of our business operations. Monitoring utilization and other factors, supporting our managed care management techniques, processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators, and our ability to compete depends on adopting technology on a timely and cost-effective basis. Malfunctions in our information systems, fraud, error, communication and energy disruptions, security breaches or the failure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems could disrupt our business operations, alienate customers, contribute to customer and provider disputes, result in regulatory violations, possible liability, increase administrative expenses or lead to other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The use of member data by all of our businesses is regulated at federal and local levels. These laws and rules change frequently, and developments require adjustments or modifications to our technology infrastructure.\nOur information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, upgrade and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, compliance with legal requirements, and changing operational needs. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately. If we are unable to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, loss of members, and difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory violations and resulting possible liability and limitations on our operations, increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. See \u201cItem 1A Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry - As a Medicare Advantage program participant, we are subject to complex regulations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties, and our Medicare Advantage contracts may be terminated or our operations may be required to change in a manner that has a material impact on our business.\u201d See also \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry - We may be subject to government audits, regulatory proceedings or investigative actions, which may find that our policies, procedures, practices or contracts are not compliant with, or are in violation of, applicable healthcare regulations.\u201d\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security system and patient data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The internet is a public network and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. We are taking all needed security measures to prevent security breaches, and ensure our business operations won\u2019t be adversely affected by potential security breaches.\nWe face risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services, claims relating to the denial of benefits or coverage, medical malpractice actions, allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities, provider disputes, broker and agent disputes, and claims by regulatory actions by agencies for non-compliance, among others. We may also be subject to an increase in litigation in our Property and Casualty segment in connection with insureds\u2019 Hurricanes Irma and Maria claims. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-Large scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and we cannot ascertain their outcome. We have insurance to cover liabilities relating to litigation; however, insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any such liability or our insurers could deny or dispute coverage. Results of regulatory actions could require us to change our business practices and may affect our profitability. Substantial liability relating to legal or regulatory actions could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations, and financial conditions. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nLarge-scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPuerto Rico has historically been at a relatively high risk of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. If Puerto Rico were to experience a large-scale natural disaster, claims incurred by our Managed Care, Life, and Property and Casualty segments would likely increase and our properties may incur substantial damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Puerto Rico has recently experienced consecutive large-scale natural disasters, such as Hurricane Maria in September 2017, and a series of earthquakes affecting certain areas in the south of the island in January 2020. If the severity of any such natural disaster exceeds what our catastrophe reinsurance protection, as in the case of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, we may potentially incur material losses. Furthermore, unforeseen major public health issues following these catastrophic events, such as pandemics and epidemics, like mosquito-borne epidemics (Dengue, Zika, etc.), conditions for which vaccines may not exist, are not effective, or have not been widely administered, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClaims in our Property and Casualty segment increased in 2017 and 2018 as the result of the losses caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Insurance Code requires the Company to resolve claims within a period of 90 days. Due to the substantial increase in the volume of claims following a catastrophic event, there is a business risk that not all claims will be resolved within the timeframe stipulated in the Puerto Rico Insurance Code, which may result in penalties imposed by the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico. We, along with various other property and casualty insurers, have in fact been fined by the Commissioner of Insurance for failing to pay claims within the 90-day period. Although we are challenging those fines, which total approximately $1.0 million, based on our interpretation of the insurance code that the extraordinary circumstances following the 2017 hurricanes justified any delay, there can be no assurances that we will prevail. Furthermore, there is a risk of an increase in the volume of litigations by insureds who are not satisfied with the insurance payout or adjustments. In fact, lawsuits against our Property and Casualty segment increased in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2019, our Property and Casualty subsidiary had been served in a total of 388 cases relating to Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Of those, 314 remianed open, and 74 had been closed, as of December 31, 2019. Although after a review of all cases served and filed but not served, we have determined that our reserves as of December 31, 2019 are adequate, there is a risk that litigation results in payments and expenses that materially exceed our reserved amount. See Note 24, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \u201cItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPresent and future covenants in our secured term loans and note purchase agreements may restrict our operations and adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.\nThe secured term loans contain financial and non-financial covenants that restrict, among other things, the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and limitations on changes in control. These non-financial covenants could restrict our operations. In addition, if we fail to make any required payment under our secured term loans or to comply with any of the non-financial covenants included therein, we would be in default and the lenders or holders of our debt, as the case may be, could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our secured term loans to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest and, cease to make further extensions of credit. If the indebtedness under our secured term loans is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or re-finance the amounts due and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt service obligations may require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be prohibited by applicable regulatory requirements, unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our secured term loan and the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness.\nIf we do not effectively manage the growth of our operations and our acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve our profitability targets.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding our healthcare delivery business, enhancing our market share in Puerto Rico, entering new geographic markets, introducing new insurance products and programs, further developing our relationships with independent agencies or brokers and pursuing acquisition opportunities. Our growth strategy exposes us to additional risks, including our ability to:\n\u2022 identify profitable growth opportunities in current and additional markets;\n\u2022 transact successful acquisitions, capital investments and other growth initiatives;\n\u2022 determine the correct value of assets and investments;\n\u2022 implement adequate pricing and operational structure, including underwriting and claim management processes;\n\u2022 design attractive and profitable insurance and health products and services;\n\u2022 recruit required personnel for expanded operations, including officers, agents, brokers, medical providers, and other key personnel;\n\u2022 obtain regulatory permission required to operate in other jurisdictions or lines of business;\n\u2022 comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 integrate acquired business to our operations, including integration of information technology, management and personnel, and administrative systems;\n\u2022 acquire business and regulatory knowledge and expertise in new lines of business;\n\u2022 create the expected return over time; and\n\u2022 implement new, or modify existing internal monitoring and control systems.\nAdditionally, our management and other key personnel may expend considerable time and effort which may distract them from their core activities. We may face risk associated to unknown or unidentified liabilities resulting from our investments or acquisitions. We may also be subject to changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting our business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and laws prohibiting corrupt payments.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $28.6 million and $1.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet, primarily related to the TSA acquisition, that represent 1.1% of our total consolidated assets and 3.2% of our consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity. In an effort to expand the health clinics reporting unit, the Company purchased various health clinics across different municipalities in Puerto Rico, resulting in a recognition of goodwill of approximately $3.2 million in 2019. The fair values initially assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as new information becomes available. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine the recoverability of their carrying values. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of the equity and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record significant impairment losses against future income. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates than the industry.\nAny future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in stockholders' equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.\nIn addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of the implementation of various Health Care Reform regulations. Such regulations could have significant effects on our future operations, which in turn could unfavorably affect our ability to support the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets and result in significant impairment charges in future periods. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d.\nThe effectiveness of our Company\u2019s strategy, talent management and alignment of talent to our business needs and risks to our brand and reputation present overarching risks our Company.\nEffectiveness of our enterprise strategy, talent management and alignment of talent to our business needs and risks to our brand and reputation present overarching risks to our Company. There can be no assurance regarding the effectiveness of our enterprise strategy, our ability to manage and align our talent to our business needs or our ability to avoid harm to our brand and reputation. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. government fiscal policy, the implementation of the ACA, repeal or other changes to the ACA or additional changes to the U.S. health care system will not require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business, put us at risk of loss of business or materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial position or operating results.\nRisks Relating to Taxation\nIf we are considered to be a controlled foreign corporation under the related person insurance income rules or a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. persons that own our shares of Class B common stock could be subject to adverse tax consequences.\nWe do not expect that we will be considered a controlled foreign corporation under the related person insurance income rules (a \u201cRPII CFC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because RPII CFC status depends in part upon the correlation between an insurance company\u2019s shareholders and such company\u2019s insurance customers and the extent of such company\u2019s insurance business outside its country of incorporation, there can be no assurance that we will not be a RPII CFC in any taxable year. We do not intend to monitor whether we generate RPII or becomes a RPII CFC.\nBased on our current business assets and operations, we do not expect that we will be considered a \u2018\u2018passive foreign investment company\u2019\u2019 (a \u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because PFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets (including, among others, less than 25 percent owned equity investments) in each year, which may be uncertain and may vary substantially over time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. Our belief that it is not a PFIC is based, in part, on the fact that the PFIC rules include provisions intended to provide an exception for bona fide insurance companies predominately engaged in an insurance business. However, the scope of this exception is not entirely clear and there are no administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions or Treasury regulations that provide guidance as to the application of the PFIC rules to insurance companies.\nIf we were a RPII CFC in any taxable year or if the Company was treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, certain adverse consequences could apply to certain U.S. persons that own our shares of Class B common stock.\nLegislative and other measures that may be taken by local and federal government taxing authorities could materially increase our tax burden.\nIn December 2018, the governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act 257 of 2018, better known as the Puerto Rico Tax Reform, to amend the Internal Revenue Code for a New Puerto Rico. Approved changes include a reduction from a 39% to a 37.5% maximum corporate tax rate; an increase from 80% to 90% on the amount of net operating loss carryover deduction available to be claimed against current year net income; an increase in the amounts of withholding at source for services rendered from 7% to 10%; a limitation in the amount of net operating losses generated by a corporate shareholder allowed to be netted against net income distributed from a flow-through investment, not permitted for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018; and a revised large taxpayer definition to include flow-through entities and extend the determination of audited financial statement requirements at the group level. The law also adds requirements for the deductibility of expenses. All of these changes are effective for taxable years beginning January 1, 2019. We do not expect the tax reform to adversely impact our tax burden. We will continue to monitor and analyze the impact of the legislation, as any increase in the amount of taxes we pay and the taxation of the customers we serve may have a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017 the US Government enacted PL 115-97, as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d). The TCJA incorporates a series of changes in tax rates at the federal level applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. United States federal corporate income tax rate is reduced from a 35% maximum to a 21% flat rate. While special tax rates on capital gains and qualified dividends remain the same under the TCJA, changes in tax rate at the federal level are expected to have minimal impact on our business, as we are currently taxed only for passive income earned on investments, which continue to be subject to withholding at source at its gross level.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nChanges in governmental regulations, or the application thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to substantial federal and local regulation and frequent changes to the applicable legislative and regulatory schemes, including general business regulations and laws relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, insurance, Medicare and health care fraud and abuse laws. Please refer to \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d. Changes in these laws, enactment of new laws or regulations, changes in interpretation of these laws or changes in enforcement of these laws and regulations may materially impact our business. Such changes include without limitation:\n\u2022 initiatives to provide greater access to coverage for uninsured and under-insured populations without adequate funding to health plan or to be funded through taxes or other negative financial levy on health plans;\n\u2022 payments to health plans that are tied to the achievement of certain quality performance measures and medical loss ratio requirements;\n\u2022 specific legislative or regulatory changes to the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including changes in the bidding process or other means to materially reduce premiums;\n\u2022 local government regulatory changes;\n\u2022 increased government enforcement actions, or changes in the interpretation or application, of fraud and abuse and health information privacy laws; and\n\u2022 regulations that increase the operational burden on health plans, or that increase a health plan\u2019s exposure to liabilities, including efforts to expand the tort liability of health plans.\nRegulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance and CMS and other agencies, among other things, influence how our insurance subsidiaries conduct business, and place limitations on investments and dividends. Possible penalties for violations of such regulations include fines, orders to cease and desist and possible suspension or termination of licenses. The regulatory powers of the Commissioner of Insurance are mainly designed to protect policyholders, not shareholders. While we cannot predict the terms of future regulation, the enactment of new legislation could affect the cost or demand for insurance policies, limit our ability to obtain rates or premiums, when needed, otherwise restrict our operations, limit the expansion of our business, expose us to expanded liability or impose additional compliance requirements. In addition, we may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with new legislation.\nFuture regulatory actions by the Commissioner of Insurance or other governmental agencies, including federal authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could impact the value of our business model and result in potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe health care reform law and the implementation of that law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe ACA provides comprehensive changes to the U.S. health care system. One key piece of the legislation imposes an annual insurance industry assessment, with increasing annual amounts based on premium growth, commonly known as the HIP fee. Such assessment may not be deductible for income tax purposes. If the cost of the federal premium tax is not included in the calculation of our rates, or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this tax, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. We expect to pay a HIP fee of $65.5 million for 2020. However, in December 2019, as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, the HIP fee was permanently repealed for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2020.\nAlso, health plans serving the individual market are subject to the guaranteed issue provisions under which the plans are required to issue coverage to individuals without regard to their health status of pre-existing conditions, which could lead to adverse selection by consumers. On July 16, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter or the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico notifying that guarantee issue provisions under ACA are not applicable to U.S. territories. However, on July 22, 2013, similar guarantee issue and other market reforms provisions were enacted in Puerto Rico as part of amendments made to the Health Insurance Code of Puerto Rico. Although the Puerto Rico legislature is considering additional legislation to provide insurance companies more flexibility to comply with the additional requirements enacted in 2013, it is uncertain whether such legislation will in fact be enacted or the effect of any such additional legislation may have on our business. If we are unable to adapt our premium structure to address the guaranteed issue requirement, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nIn the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. For example, on October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order requiring the implementation of regulations that would exempt certain association plans from complying with ACA requirements, easing restrictions on certain short-term health plans and health reimbursement arrangements and limiting hospital and insurance company consolidation while promoting competition and choice. In August 2018 the Administration adopted a final rule to support short term, limited duration scope policies, and additional activity related to the individual market is anticipated through state waivers. While Congress is no longer actively seeking to repeal and replace the ACA, additional changes are expected this year, largely through Administrative Actions.\nThe Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 provides for up to approximately $5.342 billion in Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico through September 30, 2021. Although we believe this legislation, together with the ACA, may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business, the implementation of enacted reforms, as well as future regulations and legislative changes, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform, or do not do so as effectively as our competitors, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nAs a Medicare Advantage program participant, we are subject to complex regulations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties, and our Medicare Advantage contracts may be terminated or our operations may be required to change in a manner that has a material impact on our business.\nThe laws and regulations governing Medicare Advantage program participants are complex, subject to interpretation and frequent change and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions, including the termination of our Medicare Advantage contracts. In addition, maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations as they change may, in some cases, entail substantial direct costs.\nUnder CMS regulations to implement certain ACA requirements that became effective on June 1, 2012, CMS has the authority not to renew our contracts beginning in 2015 based solely on the Star Ratings of our Medicare Advantage plans if their respective ratings do not achieve three or more stars (out of 5.0 stars) for three consecutive contract years. See the subcaption \u201cFederal Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information of the Stars Ratings. In the final call letter to Medicare Advantage organizations dated April 6, 2015, CMS stated that it would not delay contract terminations based on a plan\u2019s Star Ratings.\nHistorically, TSA plans have received annual Star Ratings higher than three stars. CMS provides an increase to the rebate share in the bid from 50% to 65% when a program reaches 3.5 STARS, and to 70% when a plan reaches 4.5 STARS. Also, a 5% quality bonus is provided to plans with Star Ratings of 4.0 or more. As of December 31, 2019, TSA\u2019s HMO plan achieved 4.0 overall on a 5.0 star rating system and TSA\u2019s PPO plan achieved an overall rating of 3.5 stars on a 5.0-star rating system effective for product offerings in the year 2021.\nThe Company is subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to audits from CMS in connection with the Medicare Advantage contracts. A CMS audit may review the effectiveness of multiple matters, including the performance of the benefit administration, coverage determinations, claims processing and payment, process of appeals and grievances, dismissals, oversight of agents and brokers, and enrollment process. CMS may impose civil monetary penalties as a result of their findings or require changes to our business practices that may adversely affect our profitability. CMS may also prevent us from subscribing new members or terminate any of our Medicare Advantage contracts if it determines that any of these plans have failed to substantially carry out the contract or is carrying out the contract in a manner that is inconsistent with the efficient or effective administration of the Medicare Advantage program. Compliance with CMS requirements may require us to divert resources that may affect the results of our operations and financial condition. Any termination or non-renewal of our Medicare Advantage plans would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may be subject to government audits, regulatory proceedings or investigative actions, which may find that our policies, procedures, practices or contracts are not compliant with, or are in violation of, applicable healthcare regulations.\nFederal, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica government authorities, including but not limited to the Commissioner of Insurance, ASES, CMS, the OIG, the Office of the Civil Rights of HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the OPM, regularly make inquiries and conduct audits concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. In addition, CMS has the right to require Medicare Advantage plan sponsors such as ourselves to self-disclose instances of noncompliance, enter into a corrective action plan, and/or hire an independent auditor to work in accordance with CMS specifications to validate if the deficiencies that were found during a CMS full or partial program audit have been corrected and provide CMS with a copy of their audit findings. If, in the future, we were required by CMS to hire an independent auditor, such audit would entail direct costs to us, in addition to potential penalties in the event of negative audit findings. We may also become the subject of non-routine regulatory or other investigations or proceedings brought by these or other authorities, and our compliance with and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged. In addition, our regulatory compliance may also be challenged by private citizens under the \u201cwhistleblower provisions\u201d of applicable laws. The defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost, diversion of resources, and a possible material adverse effect on our business.\nAn adverse action could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022 recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u2022 mandated changes in our business practices;\n\u2022 imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and/or our key employees;\n\u2022 additional reporting requirements and oversight and mandated corrective action or remediation plans;\n\u2022 loss or non-renewal of our government contracts or loss of our ability to participate in Medicare or other federal or local governmental payor programs;\n\u2022 damage to our reputation;\n\u2022 increased difficulty in marketing our products and services;\n\u2022 inability to obtain approval for future services or geographic expansions;\n\u2022 loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurance company, preferred provider or managed care organization or other licensed entity or to otherwise provide a service; and\n\u2022 suspension of ability to subscribe members.\nOur failure to maintain an effective corporate compliance program may increase our exposure to civil damages and penalties, criminal sanctions and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion, resulting from an adverse review. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could reduce our revenue and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nEffective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect the Company.\nFailure to prevent, detect or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies, including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties. Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. Fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing, and violations of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company are complex and subject to change. In addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the Dodd-Frank legislation and related regulations being adopted that enhance regulators\u2019 enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections, mean that its compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.\nIn addition, provider or member fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured customers. Further, during an economic downturn, our segments, including our Life and Property and Casualty segments may see increased fraudulent claims volume which may lead to additional costs because of an increase in disputed claims and litigation.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to address emerging security threats, including cybersecurity threats, or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents, including those related to cybersecurity, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. HIPAA regulations also provide access rights and other rights for health plan beneficiaries with respect to their health information. These regulations include standards for certain electronic transactions, including encounter and claims information, health plan eligibility and payment information. Health plans are also subject to beneficiary notification and remediation obligations in the event of an authorized use or disclosure of personal health information. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices.\nOur facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations.\nCompliance with multiple and/or new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain our ability to manage our business model. In addition, HHS has expanded its HIPAA audit program to assess compliance efforts not only by covered entities, but also business associates. Although we are not aware of HHS plans to audit any of our covered entities or business associates, an audit resulting in findings or allegations of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are also subject to stricter breach notification requirements than those imposed on covered entities by virtue of HIPAA in terms of having to provide ASES with notice of a breach within twenty-four (24) hours. These and other regulatory aspects make compliance with applicable health information laws more difficult. For these reasons, our total compliance costs may increase in the future.\nNon-compliance or findings of non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe revised rate calculation system for Medicare Advantage, the payment system for the Medicare Part D and changes in the methodology and payment policies used by CMS to establish rates could reduce our profitability and the benefits we offer our beneficiaries.\nMedicare Advantage managed care plans are paid based off a CMS-calculated \u201cbenchmark\u201d amount, and plans submit competitive bids that reflect the costs they expect to incur in providing the base Medicare benefits. A Medicare Advantage plan\u2019s actual payment rate is based on a complex statutory formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the relationship between the plan\u2019s bid and the benchmark. Medicare generally will rebate a portion of the amount by which the benchmark amount exceeded the accepted bid for certain plans. For plans achieving star rating of at least 3.5 stars, the portion of the savings retained by the plan is higher. For plans achieving star ratings of at least 4 stars, the starting benchmark amount from which the savings is computed is also higher (a \u201cquality bonus\u201d). If the bid is greater than the benchmark, the plan will be required to charge a premium to enrollees equal to the difference between the bid and the benchmark, which could affect our ability to attract enrollees. CMS reviews the methodology and assumptions used in bidding with respect to medical and administrative costs, profitability and other factors. CMS could challenge such methodology or assumptions or seek to cap or limit plan profitability. CMS also could administratively seek to implement certain methodological changes to the Medicare Advantage rate calculations that could result in functionally lower payment rates, and may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe also face the risk of reduced or insufficient government funding and we may need to terminate our Medicare Advantage contracts with respect to unprofitable markets. In addition, as a result of the competitive bidding process, our ability to participate in the Medicare Advantage program is affected by the pricing and design of our competitors\u2019 bids. Moreover, we may in the future be required to reduce benefits or charge our members an additional premium in order to maintain our current level of profitability, either of which could make our health plans less attractive to members and adversely affect our membership.\nOn January 6, 2020 and February 5, 2020, CMS released Part I and Part II, respectively, of its draft Advance Notice as well as additional Proposed Rules for Medicare Advantage reimbursement in 2021. This draft notices contains important provisions that sustain the Puerto Rico MA program, including the zero claims adjustment. The call letter will be finalized in early April.\nCMS\u2019s risk adjustment payment system and other Medicare Advantage funding pressures make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments to our results of operations.\nCMS has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare Advantage plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for such plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. The risk adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which are possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS, or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. The data provided to CMS to determine members\u2019 risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur, which may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. The result of these audits could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our result of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCMS is making significant changes to the manner in which it determines risk adjustment payments, including possible retroactive recoveries. CMS introduced a new model for 2020 and continues to shift towards encounter based risk scores (EDS). As a result of the risk adjustment process and CMS\u2019s ability to modify the manner in which it applies such risk adjustments, it is difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability. In addition, our own risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustment to payment from CMS and our Medicare payment revenue.\nFinally, we generally rely on providers, including certain network providers who are not our employees, to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis codes submitted with claims, as the basis for our risk scores under the program. Thus, our ability to meet our premium revenue estimates depends largely on the success of third party efforts to collect and properly reflect medical data, including diagnosis codes that must be submitted with claims. There is no assurance that our providers will be successful in accurately collecting such medical data and diagnosis codes and, to the extent their efforts are not successful, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our premium revenues.\nASES\u2019s risk adjustment payment system and payment structure, and its dependence on scarce or unavailable data, make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments to our results of operations.\nASES has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for the Vital Program plan to reflect the differences in morbidity of enrolled members and differences in the regional cost of care. The risk adjusted payment transfers are based on claims and encounter data that is submitted to ASES. The risk adjustment factors are based on a prospective model, whereby the data for the prior year is used to establish the risk adjustment payments for the current year. For example, the risk scores are assigned to each member for the contract year ending October 31, 2019 using claims data for those members during the year ending October 31, 2018. We have been unable to develop reliable estimates for risk-adjusted premiums because of the lack of available data from prior periods which are the basis for risk scores. We have recognized an estimated risk-adjusted transfer payment for 2019 using the risk adjustment data provided by our actuaries. We were notified in December 2019 of the risk adjustment transfer payment for the period November 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019, but the final transfer payment for the first contract year will not be known until later in 2020 and may result in an unfavorable adjustment. ASES has not provided a timeline for the communication of the risk transfer payments.\nFurthermore, the premium rates for the second contract year, which represents the period November 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, will be adjusted by a morbidity factor which will reflect the change in the overall morbidity of the population from the base period (July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017) and the contract year. This adjustment may result in unfavorable adjustment to payments from ASES and our Medicaid premium revenue.\nASES has additionally implemented a payment structure for the program that assigns members to one of 37 rate cells based on their age, gender, eligibility category and health conditions. Members assigned to High Cost High Needs (HCHN) rate cells receive premium payments that are much higher than those assigned based only on age and gender. If our enrollees are not assigned to the adequate rate cell, the premium we receive may not be sufficient to cover for their utilization, particularly in the case of HCHN members.\nFinally, ASES may recover premiums paid for non-eligible participants. However, we are dependent on ASES, which is in turn dependent on the local Medicaid office, for eligibility data. Historically, ASES has not received updated eligibility data from the local Medicaid office in a timely manner. Therefore, if we are not provided with timely eligibility data and we bill ASES for non-eligible members, ASES could attempt to recoup premiums from us, which could have a significant impact in our consolidated premiums and profitability.\nIf during the open enrollment season our Medicare Advantage members enroll in another Medicare Advantage plan, they will be automatically disenrolled from our plan, possibly without our immediate knowledge.\nPursuant to the MMA, members enrolled in one insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program will be automatically disenrolled from that program if they enroll in another insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program. If our members enroll in another insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program, we may not discover that such member has been disenrolled from our program until such time as we fail to receive reimbursement from CMS in respect of such member, which may occur sometime after the disenrollment. As a result, we may discover that a member has disenrolled from our program after we have already provided services to such individual. Our profitability would be reduced as a result of such failure to receive payment from CMS if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from them.\nIf we are deemed to have violated the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act, we may suffer adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to change of control statutes applicable to insurance companies. These statutes regulate, among other things, the acquisition of control of an insurance company or its holding company. Under these statutes, no person may make an offer to acquire or to sell the issued and outstanding voting stock of an insurance company, which constitutes 10% or more of its issued and outstanding stock, or of the total issued and outstanding stock of an insurance holding company, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation (the articles) prohibit any institutional investor from owning 10% or more of our voting power and any person that is not an institutional investor from owning 5% or more of our voting power. We cannot, however, assure you that ownership of our securities will remain below these thresholds. To the extent that a person, including an institutional investor, acquires shares in excess of these limits, our articles provide for the Company to take certain actions, including refusing to give effect to a transfer or instituting proceedings to enjoin or rescind a transfer, in order to avoid a violation of the ownership limitation in the articles. If the Commissioner of Insurance determines that a change of control has occurred without the Commissioner\u2019s prior approval, we could be subject to fines and penalties, and in some instances the Commissioner of Insurance would have the discretion to revoke our operating licenses.\nWe are also subject to change of control limitations pursuant to our BCBSA license agreements. The BCBSA ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for an institutional investor and less than 5% for a non-institutional investor, both as defined in our articles. In addition, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or a combination thereof, representing a 20% or more ownership interest, whether voting or non-voting, in our company. This provision in our articles cannot be changed without the prior approval of the BCBSA and the vote of holders of at least 75% of our common stock.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital requirements. Our failure to meet these standards could expose us to regulatory actions.\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance, among other things, impose minimum capital requirements to our insurance subsidiaries, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed by our insurance subsidiaries to us. Although our insurance subsidiaries are currently in compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply in the future. Failure to maintain required levels of capital or to otherwise comply with the reporting requirements of the Commissioner of Insurance could subject our insurance subsidiaries to corrective actions, including involuntary rehabilitation or liquidation processes, or require us to provide financial assistance, either through subordinated loans or capital infusions, to ensure they maintain their minimum statutory capital requirements.\nWe are also subject to minimum capital requirements pursuant to our BCBSA license agreements. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The termination or modification of our license agreements to use the BCBS name and mark could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and regulations and provisions of our articles and bylaws could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and have the effect of entrenching management.\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and our articles and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur license agreements with the BCBSA require that our articles contain certain provisions, including ownership limitations. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry-If we are deemed to have violated the insurance company change of control statutes in Puerto Rico, we may suffer adverse consequences.\u201d\nOur articles and bylaws have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. In particular, our articles and bylaws:\n\u2022 permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022 divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on shareholders\u2019 ability to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022 impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022 impose restrictions on shareholders\u2019 ability to amend our articles and bylaws.\nSee also \u201cRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry-If we are deemed to have violated the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act, we may suffer adverse consequences.\u201d\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance may also delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. For instance, the Commissioner of Insurance must review any merger, consolidation or new issuance of shares of capital stock of an insurer or its parent company and make a determination as to the fairness of the transaction. Also, a director of an insurer must meet certain requirements imposed by Puerto Rico insurance laws.\nThese voting and other restrictions may operate to make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance.", "PERMNO": 92506, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "GTS"}
