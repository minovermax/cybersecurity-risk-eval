RISK FACTORS\nOur business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties, including the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with any other documents we file with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA loss of any significant Portal and Advertising customer could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our efforts to provide a compelling consumer experience that increases consumer engagement with our Managed Portals. We have made and will continue to make investments in features and functionality for our technology that are designed to drive consumer engagement. If the expenses that we incur in connection with these activities do not result in increased consumer engagement that in turn results in revenue increases that exceed these expenses, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have diversified our product portfolio and our customer base, we continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of Managed Portal customers. For 2018, revenue attributable to two customers each exceeded 10% of our total revenue, and on a combined basis accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue, or $34.6 million. For 2019, revenue attributable to one customer exceeded 10% of our total revenue, and accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue, or $16.4 million.\nOur contracts with our Managed Portals and Advertising customers generally have an initial term of approximately two to three years from the launch of their Managed Portals and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. If a key contract is not renewed or is otherwise terminated, or if revenue from a significant customer declines because of competitive or other reasons, including the customer\u2019s desire to reprioritize or deemphasize monetization of the portal, our revenue would decline and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be impaired. In addition to the loss of recurring and fee-based revenue, we would also lose significant revenue from the related search and digital advertising services that we provide. In addition to the decline of revenue, we may have to impair our long-lived assets, to the extent that such assets are used exclusively to support these customers, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nOur search advertising partner, Google, accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, and any loss of, or diminution in, our business relationship with Google would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on traffic on our Managed Portals to generate search and digital advertising revenue, a substantial portion of which is derived from text-based links to advertisers\u2019 websites as a result of internet searches. We have a revenue-sharing relationship with Google under which we include a Google-branded search tool on our Managed Portals. When a consumer makes a search request using this tool, we deliver it to Google, and Google returns search results to us that include advertiser-sponsored links. If the consumer clicks on a sponsored link, Google receives payment from the sponsor of that link and shares a portion of that payment with us. We then typically share a portion of that payment with the applicable customer. Google may terminate our agreement if we experience a change in control, if we enter into an agreement providing for a change in control, if we do not maintain certain search and digital advertising revenue levels or if we fail to conform to Google\u2019s search and advertising policies. Google may from time to time change its existing, or establish new, methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality of internet traffic. Any changes in these methodologies, metrics and advertising technology platforms could decrease the advertising rates that we receive and/or the amount of revenue that we generate from digital advertisements. If advertisers were to discontinue their advertising via internet searches, if Google\u2019s revenue from search-based advertising were to decrease, if Google\u2019s share of the search revenue were to increase or if our agreement with Google were to be terminated for any reason or renewed on less favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, consumers\u2019 increased use of search tools other than the Google-branded search tool we provide would have similar effects.\nOur Managed Portals solutions has suffered a loss of users, which may adversely affect our Portal business.\nThe number of active portal users has declined consistently for several years, and may further contract in the future.\nWhile we work with our customers to have their consumers\u2019 homepages set to our Managed Portals, a consumer may easily change that setting, which would likely decrease the use of our Managed Portals. Similarly, consumers who change their device\u2019s operating system, or internet browser, or acquire new consumer electronics devices may no longer have our Managed Portals set as their default homepage, and unless they change it back to our Managed Portals, their usage of our Managed Portals would likely decline and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, the number of people who access the internet through devices other than PCs, including tablets, smartphones and connected TVs, has increased dramatically and is projected to continue to increase. Similarly, individuals are increasingly accessing the internet through apps other than internet browsers. Our Managed Portals include our responsive desktop and mobile web products and also our mobile native iOS and Android apps. If consumers do not use our mobile products at all or use these products less frequently than previously, our financial results could be negatively affected. Additionally, as new devices and new apps are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing new versions of our apps and other solutions for use on these alternative devices and apps, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such apps and solutions. If users of these devices and apps do not widely adopt the apps and other solutions we develop, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nConsumer tastes continually change and are unpredictable, and sales of our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions may decline if we fail to enhance our service and content offerings to achieve continued consumer acceptance.\nOur business depends on aggregating and providing services and content that our customers will place on our Managed Portals, including television programming, news, entertainment, sports and other content that their consumers find engaging, and premium services and paid content that their consumers will buy. Accordingly, we must continue to invest resources in licensing efforts, research and development and marketing to enhance our service and content offerings, and we must make decisions about these matters well in advance of product releases to implement them in a timely manner. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing content providers and websites and the availability of other news, entertainment, sports and other services and content.\nIf our services are not responsive to the requirements of our customers or the preferences of their consumers, or the services are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Even if our services and content are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a subsequent shift in the preferences of our customers or their consumers could cause a decline in the popularity of our services and content that could reduce our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for content that is critical to our business, and our business could suffer if we do not continue to obtain high-quality content at a reasonable cost.\nWe license the content that we aggregate on our Managed Portals from numerous third-party content providers, and our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain and enter into new relationships with these and other content providers. In some cases, we are required under our contracts, to provide our customers\u2019 consumers access to certain types of content. In the future, some of our content providers may not give us access to high-quality content, may fail to adapt to changes in consumer tastes or may increase the royalties, fees or percentages that they charge us for their content, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Our rights to the content that we offer to our customers and their consumers are not exclusive, and the content providers could license their content to our competitors. Our content providers could even grant our competitors exclusive licenses. In addition, our customers are not prohibited from entering into content deals directly with our content providers. Any failure to enter into or maintain satisfactory arrangements with content providers would adversely affect our ability to provide a variety of attractive services and products to our customers. Our reputation and operating results could suffer as a result, and it may be more difficult for us to develop new relationships with potential customers.\nMany of our customers are high-speed internet service providers, and consolidation within the cable and telecommunications industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant revenue from high-speed internet service and communications providers, including our search and digital advertising revenue generated by online consumer traffic on our Managed Portals. The cable and telecommunications industries have experienced consolidation over the past several years, and we expect that this trend will continue. As a result of consolidation, some of our customers may be acquired by companies with which we do not have existing relationships and which may have relationships with one of our competitors or may have the in-house capability to perform the services we provide. As a result, such acquisitions could cause us to lose customers and the associated revenue. Under our agreements with some of our customers, they may have the right to terminate the agreement if we are acquired by one of their competitors.\nConsolidation may also require us to renegotiate our agreements with our customers as a result of enhanced customer leverage. We may not be able to offset the effects of any such renegotiations, and we may not be able to attract new customers to counter any revenue declines resulting from the loss of customers or their subscribers.\nWe may not maintain acceptable website performance for our Managed Portals and Advertising customers, which may negatively impact our relationships with our customers and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA key element to our continued growth is the ability of our customers\u2019 consumers in all geographies to access our Managed Portals and other offerings within acceptable load times. We refer to this as website performance. We may in the future experience platform disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our technology simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks.\nIn some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve website performance, especially during peak usage times, and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. If our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions are unavailable when consumers attempt to access them or do not load as quickly as they expect, consumers may seek other alternatives to obtain the information for which they are looking, and may not use our products and services as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our relationships with our customers. We expect to continue to make investments to maintain and improve website performance. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur sales cycles and the contracting process with new customers are long and unpredictable and may require us to incur expenses before executing a customer agreement, which makes it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate additional revenue and cash flows from those customers.\nWe market our services and products directly to high-speed internet service and communications providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and directly and indirectly to enterprises, and governmental and nonprofit organizations. New customer relationships typically take time to obtain and finalize because of the burdensome cost of migrating from an existing solution to our platform. Due to operating procedures in many organizations, a significant time period may pass between selection of our services and products by key decision-makers and the signing of a contract. The length of time between the initial customer sales call and the realization of significant sales is difficult to predict and can range from several months to several years. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and when we will begin to generate revenue and cash flows from these potential new customers.\nAs part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses in the form of compensation and related expenses and equipment acquisition before executing a definitive agreement with a prospective customer so that we may be ready to launch shortly following execution of a definitive agreement. If conditions in the marketplace or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive agreement will be executed, and we will be unable to recover any expenses incurred before a definitive agreement is executed, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely, to a significant degree, on indirect sales channels for the distribution of our Software products, and disruption within these channels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe use a variety of indirect distribution methods for our offerings, including channel partners, such as cloud service providers, distributors, and value added resellers. A number of these partners in turn distribute our offerings via their own networks of channel partners with whom we have no direct relationship. These relationships allow us to offer our technologies to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able through our direct sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our channel partners or a partner in its distribution network violate applicable law or regulatory requirements or misrepresent the functionality of our offerings, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to potential liability. Furthermore, our channel partners may offer their own products and services that are competitive with our offerings or may not distribute and market our offerings effectively. Our existing channel partner relationships do not, and any future channel partner relationships may not, afford us exclusive marketing or distribution rights. In addition, if a channel partner is acquired by a competitor or its business units are reorganized or divested, our revenue derived from that partner may be adversely impacted.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technologies requires significant time and resources. If we fail to devote sufficient resources to support and expand our network of channel partners, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, because we rely on channel partners for the indirect distribution of our technologies, we may have little or no contact with the ultimate end-users of our technologies, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our software, support ongoing customer requirements, estimate end-user demand, respond to evolving customer needs and obtain renewals from end-users. If our indirect distribution channel is disrupted, we may be required to devote more resources to distribute our offerings directly and support our customers, which may not be as effective and could lead to higher costs, reduced revenue and growth that is slower than expected.\nWe have a history of significant pre-tax net losses and may not be profitable in future periods.\nWe have reported annual pre-tax net losses since 2013. Over the years, we have taken cost saving measures, including reductions in workforce. However, our expenses have increased and may continue to increase in future periods as we implement initiatives designed to grow our business including, among other things, the ongoing costs and expenses we must incur in connection with providing our solutions, acquisitions of complementary businesses, the development and marketing of new services and products, licensing of content, expansion of our infrastructure and international expansion. If our revenue does not sufficiently increase to offset these expected increases in operating expenses, or if we are not able to sufficiently reduce costs in the event our revenue increases fail to materialize, we may incur significant losses and may not be profitable. We may not be able to return to or maintain profitability in the future. Any failure to achieve or maintain profitability may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019 our cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $48.2 million. A failure to achieve or maintain profitability may adversely affect our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of our pre-tax cumulative losses, we have established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset, which includes our net operating loss carryforwards.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201cfive-percent stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. For these purposes, a five-percent stockholder is generally any person or group of persons that at any time during the applicable testing period has owned 5% or more of our outstanding stock. In addition, persons who own less than 5% of the outstanding stock are grouped together as one or more \u201cpublic groups,\u201d which are also treated as five-percent stockholders. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations.\nOur services and products may become less competitive or even obsolete if we fail to respond to technological developments.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to modify or enhance our services and products to meet customer and consumer needs, to add functionality and to address technological advancements that would improve their performance. For example, if our smartphone and tablet products fail to capture the increased search activity on such devices or if our services and products do not adapt to the increasing video usage on the internet or to take into account evolving developments in social networking, then they could begin to appear obsolete. Similarly, if we fail to develop new ways to deliver content and services through apps other than traditional internet browsers, consumers could seek alternative means of accessing content and services.\nTo remain competitive, we will need to develop new services and products and adapt our existing ones to address these and other evolving technologies and standards. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying new opportunities or in developing or marketing new services and products in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, our product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price levels necessary for profitability. If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing services and products or if we are unable to develop new services and products that keep pace with rapid technological developments or changing industry standards, our services and products may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive, and our business will be harmed.\nOur Zimbra Email/Collaboration solution was developed as an open-source software product. As such, it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of which may have greater resources than we have, to compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone may modify and redistribute the existing open source software and use it to compete with us. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. In addition, some of these competitors may make their open source software available for free download and use on an ad hoc basis or may position their open source software as a loss leader. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure and/or the availability of open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nAs a result of the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete, our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to the various factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as:\n\u2022any failure to maintain strong relationships and favorable revenue-sharing arrangements with our Managed Portals and Advertising partners, in particular Google, including a reduction in the quantity or pricing of sponsored links that consumers click on or a reduction in the pricing of digital advertisements by advertisers;\n\u2022the timing of our investment in, or the timing of our monetization of, our products and services, such as our end-to-end video solutions portfolio or our Zimbra Email/Collaboration product;\n\u2022any failure of significant customers to renew their agreements with us;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022any development by our significant customers of the in-house capacity to replace the solutions we provide;\n\u2022the release of new product and service offerings by our competitors or our customers;\n\u2022variations in the demand for our services and products and the implementation cycles of our services and products by our customers;\n\u2022changes to internet browser technology that may render our Managed Portals less competitive;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in the prices our customers charge their consumers for email, premium services and paid content;\n\u2022service outages, other technical difficulties or security breaches;\n\u2022limitations relating to the capacity of our networks, systems and processes;\n\u2022our failure to accurately estimate or control costs, including costs related to the implementation of our solutions for new customers;\n\u2022maintaining appropriate staffing levels and capabilities relative to projected growth;\n\u2022the timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies, services or businesses to support our existing customers and potential growth opportunities; and\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to internet usage and online businesses.\nFor these reasons and because the market for our services and products is relatively new and rapidly changing, it is difficult to predict our future financial results.\nInternational operations are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from, and have operations, outside of the United States. Revenue from customer outside of the United States was 18% of total revenue in 2019. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings internationally, particularly in Asia, Canada, Latin America and Europe.\nAs the international markets in which we operate continue to grow, we expect that competition in these markets will intensify. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local markets. Some of our domestic competitors who have substantially greater resources than we do may be able to more quickly and comprehensively develop and grow in international markets. International expansion may also require significant financial investment including, among other things, the expense of developing localized products, the costs of acquiring foreign companies and the integration of such companies with our operations, expenditure of resources in developing customer and content relationships and the increased costs of supporting remote operations.\nOther risks of doing business in international markets include the increased risks and burdens of complying with different legal and regulatory standards, difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations, recruiting and retaining talented direct sales personnel, limitations on the repatriation of funds and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates, varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure and our ability to enforce contracts and our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. Additionally there are risks associated with fundamental changes to international markets, such as those that may occur as a result of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (\"Brexit\"). Brexit may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute to volatility in the foreign exchange markets, which we may be unable to effectively manage.\nIn addition, our success in international expansion could be limited by barriers to international expansion such as tariffs, adverse tax consequences and technology export controls. If we cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in some international markets may be prohibitive or our costs may increase disproportionately to our revenue. Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur with respect to our expansion into international markets. Our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences, including adverse publicity and damage to our reputation that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreements with some of our customers contain penalties for non-performance, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have entered into service level agreements with many of our customers. These agreements generally call for specific system \u201cup times\u201d and 24 hours per day, seven days per week support and include penalties for non-performance. We may be unable to fulfill these commitments due to circumstances beyond our control, which could subject us to substantial penalties under those agreements, harm our reputation and result in a reduction of revenue or the loss of customers, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our agreements with customers contain penalties for certain types of non-performance which, if not timely rectified, could result in substantial financial penalties to us.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models, subject us to additional expenses and expose us to increased liability.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business.\nGlobally, new and emerging laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in Europe, state laws in the U.S. on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), potential U.S. federal legislation regarding consumer privacy, as well as industry self-regulatory codes create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. For example, the CCPA may precipitate additional privacy regulation by federal, state and local governments, which may increase our compliance costs and strain our technical capabilities, and such regulations may conflict with each other making it impossible to comply with all such regulations. Ensuring compliance with such laws is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our business practices fail to comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy regulations, our privacy policies or other related obligations (including in our agreements with customers), or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other subscriber data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, loss of access to data transfer mechanisms, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, or, terminate their agreements with us, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nSystem failures, security breaches, computer viruses or capacity constraints could harm our business and financial performance.\nThe provision of our services and products depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Such interruptions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer malware, computer hacking attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruptions if the operators of the facilities have financial difficulties. Although we maintain insurance to cover a variety of risks, the scope and amount of our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions to our online operations. Any system failure or disruption and any resulting losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot all of our data centers are on full second-site redundancy, only certain customers require this capability. We regularly back-up our systems and store the system back-ups. If we were forced to relocate to an alternate site and to rely on our system back-ups to restore the systems, we could experience significant delays in restoring the functionality of our platform and could experience loss of data, which could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to expand our business, and the loss of key officers or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, finance, marketing and creative personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, marketing and media companies, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we were to be unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business could suffer.\nVolatility or lack of performance in the trading price of our common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become, or will become, vested in company stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their options have significantly declined in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the trading price of our common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe may expand our business through acquisitions of, mergers with, or investments in, other companies or new technologies, or joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention or prove not to be successful.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may decide to pursue acquisitions of, mergers with, investments in, or joint ventures involving other technologies and businesses in the future. Such transactions could divert our management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business or prove not to be successful.\nIntegrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including, among other things, with respect to:\n\u2022incorporating new technologies into our existing business infrastructure;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative functions;\n\u2022coordinating our sales and marketing functions to incorporate the new business or technology;\n\u2022maintaining morale, retaining and integrating key employees to support the new business or technology and managing our expansion in capacity; and\n\u2022maintaining standards, controls, procedures and policies (including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures).\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we may acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our operating results.\nFuture acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, including our common stock, or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or acquired in-process research and development expenses, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to grow our business, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe operation of our business and our growth strategy may require significant additional capital, especially if we were to accelerate our expansion and acquisition plans. If the cash generated from operations and otherwise available to us is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. We may not be able to raise needed capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may cause our existing stockholders to suffer substantial dilution. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. As with our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, any debt financing obtained by us in the future could contain financial or other covenants that may potentially restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with those covenants, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf new or existing sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable, we could be required to delay, abandon or otherwise modify our growth and operating plans to the extent of available funding, which would harm our ability to grow our business.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nThe protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on copyright and service mark enforcement, contractual restrictions and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with certain parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure and distribution of our proprietary information. Additionally, we have applied for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property. We have registered several marks and filed many other trademark applications in the United States and internationally. We have not applied for copyright protection in any jurisdiction including in the United States. However, if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization, and, our business may suffer from the piracy of our technology and the associated loss in revenue.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be costly and divert management resources, either of which could harm our business. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings with respect to protecting our intellectual property; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings with respect to protecting our intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nAny claims from a third party that we are infringing upon its intellectual property, whether valid or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses or force us to curtail some services or products.\nCompanies in the internet and technology industries tend to own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have been subject to claims that the presentation of certain licensed content on our Managed Portals infringes certain patents of various third parties, none of which have resulted in material direct settlement or payments by us or any determination of infringement by us, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of further intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services and products to others and may require that we procure substitute products or services for our customers.\nIn the case of any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available to us on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for the infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these consequences could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, we typically have contractual obligations to our customers to indemnify and defend them with respect to third-party intellectual property infringement claims that arise from our customers\u2019 use of our products or services. Such claims, whether valid or not, could harm our relationships with our customers, could result in us or our customers having to enter into licenses with the claimants and could cause us to incur additional costs or experience reduced revenue. Such claims could also subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation as well as diverting management attention and resources. Satisfying our contractual indemnification obligations could also give rise to significant liability, and thus harm our business and our operating results.\nWe are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings with respect to third party claims that we or our customers\u2019 use of our products and services are infringing upon their intellectual property; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings with respect to such claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.\nAny unauthorized disclosure or theft of personal information we gather could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation.\nWe collect, and have access to, personal information of subscribers, including names, addresses, account numbers, credit card numbers and email addresses. There are numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and guidelines around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, destruction and security of personal information and other subscriber data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. Ensuring compliance with such laws is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that despite our efforts, governmental authorities or third parties will assert that our business practices fail to comply.\nUnauthorized disclosure of such personal information, whether through breach of our systems by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information we possess, our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by subscribers or our customers. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to disclose any material weaknesses in such internal control. During our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (i) ineffective control activities due to the lack of timeliness and consistency in executing business process controls, and (ii) ineffective monitoring controls to ascertain whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. We have concluded that we have remediated these material weaknesses as of December 31, 2019. For more information about these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts, see Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nIf we fail to maintain our remediated internal control environment, investors and other users of our financial statements could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial information. We could be obligated to incur additional costs to improve the our internal controls, which may adversely affect our reputation and its operating prospects. Further, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, this could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our SEC reporting obligations or Nasdaq listing requirements on a timely basis, adversely affect our reputation, cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe growth of the market for our services and products depends on the continued growth of the internet as a medium for content, advertising, commerce and communications.\nExpansion in the sales of our services and products depends on the continued acceptance of the internet as a platform for content, advertising, commerce and communications. The acceptance of the internet as a medium for such uses could be adversely impacted by delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, privacy protection, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as such a medium has been harmed by viruses, worms, and similar malicious programs, and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If for any reason the internet does not remain a medium for widespread content, advertising, commerce and communications, the demand for our services and products would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business.\nThe growth of the market for our services and products depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure.\nOur business strategy depends on continued internet and high-speed internet access growth. Any downturn in the use or growth rate of the internet or high-speed internet access would be detrimental to our business. If the internet continues to experience significant growth in number of users, frequency of use and amount of data transmitted, the internet infrastructure might not be able to support the demands placed on it and the performance or reliability of the internet may be adversely affected. The success of our business therefore depends on the development and maintenance of a sound internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, such as routers, for providing reliable internet access and services. Consequently, as internet usage increases, the growth of the market for our products depends upon improvements made to the internet as well as to individual customers\u2019 networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion. In addition, any delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to govern increased levels of internet activity or increased governmental regulation may have a detrimental effect on the internet infrastructure.\nThe market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete effectively, our sales may decline and our business may be harmed.\nCompetition in the market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies and customer and subscriber requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. Our competitors may develop solutions that are similar or superior to our technology. Our primary competitors include high-speed internet service providers with internal information technology staff capable of developing solutions similar to our technology. Other competitors include: Google; Verizon Media; and MSN, a division of Microsoft. Advantages some of our existing and potential competitors hold over us include the following:\n\u2022significantly greater revenue and financial resources;\n\u2022stronger brand and consumer recognition;\n\u2022the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of services and products;\n\u2022ability to offer their products at significantly lower prices or at no cost;\n\u2022more extensive proprietary intellectual property from which they can develop or aggregate content without having to pay fees or paying significantly lower fees than we do;\n\u2022pre-existing relationships with content providers that afford them access to content while blocking the access of competitors to that same content;\n\u2022pre-existing relationships with high-speed internet service providers that afford them the opportunity to convert such providers to competing services and products;\n\u2022lower labor and development costs; and\n\u2022broader global distribution and presence.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the internet continues to evolve, and new laws and regulations could significantly harm our financial performance.\nOver time, we expect state, federal and international legislative bodies to continue to enact more stringent laws and regulations relating to the internet. The adoption or modification of laws related to the internet could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, increasing our costs and administrative burden.\nDue to the increasing popularity and use of the internet, many laws and regulations relating to the internet are being debated at the international, federal and state levels, which are likely to address a variety of issues such as:\n\u2022user privacy and expression;\n\u2022ability to collect and/or share necessary information that allows us to conduct business on the internet;\n\u2022export compliance;\n\u2022pricing and taxation;\n\u2022fraud;\n\u2022advertising;\n\u2022intellectual property rights;\n\u2022consumer protection;\n\u2022protection of minors;\n\u2022content regulation;\n\u2022information security; and\n\u2022quality of services and products.\nSeveral federal laws that could have an impact on our business have been adopted. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 reduces the liability of online service providers of third-party content, including content that may infringe copyrights or rights of others, but requires strict compliance with certain provisions to qualify for the safe harbor provisions; the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors under the age of 13; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.\nIt could be costly for us to comply with existing and potential laws and regulations, and they could harm our marketing efforts and our attractiveness to advertisers by, among other things, restricting our ability to collect demographic and personal information from consumers or to use or disclose that information in certain ways. If we were to violate these laws or regulations, or if it were alleged that we had, we could face private lawsuits, fines, penalties and injunctions and our business could be harmed.\nFinally, the applicability to the internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could also increase our costs of doing business, discourage internet communications, reduce demand for our services and expose us to substantial liability.\nIncreased regulation and industry standards related to internet privacy issues may prevent us from, or may increase the cost of, providing our current products and solutions to our customers, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, sharing, processing, disclosure, destruction and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have come under increased public scrutiny and, as a result, there are an increasing number of regulations and industry standards that affect our business. Regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and regulators in the EEA and other countries, have restricted and continue to restrict our ability to use personal information and therefore may limit or inhibit our ability to operate our business. In addition, many nations and economic regions have privacy protections that are more stringent or otherwise at odds with those in the United States.\nFor example, the EEA traditionally has imposed stricter obligations and provided for more onerous penalties than the United States. The European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Complying with new privacy and security requirements, whether imposed by regulation, contract or industry standard, will require additional expenditures and may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with employees or users in the EEA.\nThe United States and other countries have been looking to the GDPR as precedent for new data protection regulation. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) which went into effect on January 1, 2020, requires companies to provide new data disclosure, access and deletion rights to California consumers, afford such consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and impose significant penalties for non-compliance or data breaches. The CCPA may precipitate additional privacy regulation by federal, state and local governments, which may increase our compliance costs and strain our technical capabilities, and it is possible that such regulations may conflict with each other.\nWe may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, our services or our privacy policies.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nQumu shareholders will receive a fixed ratio of 1.61 shares of Synacor common stock for each share of Qumu common stock regardless of any changes in market value of Qumu common stock or Synacor common stock before the completion of the merger.\nAt the effective time of the merger, each share of Qumu common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.61 shares of Synacor common stock. There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio (except for adjustments to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Synacor common stock or Qumu common stock), and the parties do not have a right to terminate the merger agreement based upon changes in the market price of either Synacor common stock or Qumu common stock. The respective market value of Synacor\u2019s and Qumu\u2019s common stock since the announcement of the merger has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions and changes in Synacor\u2019s or Qumu\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects. Many of these factors are outside the control of Synacor and Qumu.\nThe market value of Synacor common stock at the time of completion of the merger may be lower or higher than the closing price of Synacor common stock on the last full trading day preceding the public announcement of the proposed merger on February 11, 2020 (the date that Synacor and Qumu entered into the merger agreement), the last full trading day prior to the date that the joint proxy statement/prospectus is filed with the SEC, or the last full trading day prior to the date of Synacor\u2019s and Qumu\u2019s shareholder meetings. Moreover, completion of the merger may occur some time after the requisite shareholder approvals have been obtained. Consequently, at the time Qumu shareholders must decide whether to approve the merger agreement, they will not know the market price of the Synacor common stock they will receive and the market price of the Qumu common stock they will surrender when the merger is actually consummated. The value of the Synacor common stock received by Qumu shareholders will depend on the market price of the Synacor common stock at that time the merger occurs, and the value of the Qumu common stock surrendered by Qumu shareholders will depend on the market price of the Qumu common stock at that time.\nThe issuance of shares of Synacor common stock to Qumu shareholders in the merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of Synacor stockholders.\nIf the merger is completed, Synacor stockholders are expected to own approximately 64.4% of the outstanding shares of Synacor common stock and former Qumu shareholders are expected to own approximately 35.6% of the outstanding shares of Synacor common stock following the completion of the merger. The issuance of shares of Synacor common stock to Qumu shareholders in the merger will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interest of current Synacor stockholders in earnings, voting, liquidation value and book and market value.\nWhether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could impact or cause disruptions in the businesses of Qumu and Synacor, which could have an adverse effect on the businesses and operating results of Qumu and Synacor.\nWhether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact the businesses and operating results of Qumu and Synacor, including among others:\n\u2022Qumu and Synacor employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect Qumu\u2019s and Synacor\u2019s ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees;\n\u2022the attention of Qumu\u2019s and Synacor\u2019s management may be directed toward completion of the merger and transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the businesses of Qumu and Synacor; and\n\u2022customers, channel partners, vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with Qumu or Synacor, or delay or defer decisions concerning Qumu\u2019s or Synacor\u2019s products or services or seek alternatives to the products or services offered by Qumu or Synacor.\nThese disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement and could have an adverse effect on the businesses, operating results or prospects of Qumu and Synacor if the merger is not completed or the business, operating results or prospects of the combined company if the merger is completed.\nFailure to successfully integrate the businesses of Synacor and Qumu in the expected time-frame may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results.\nSynacor and Qumu entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of Synacor and Qumu must be successfully integrated. Historically, Synacor and Qumu have been independent companies, and they will continue to be operated as such until the completion of the merger. The integration may be complex and time consuming and may require substantial resources and effort. The management of the combined company may face significant challenges in consolidating the operations of Synacor and Qumu, integrating the two companies\u2019 technologies, procedures, and policies, as well as addressing the different corporate cultures of the two companies. If the companies are not successfully integrated, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nCustomer uncertainties related to the merger could adversely affect the businesses, revenues and gross margins of Synacor and the combined company.\nIn response to the announcement of the merger or due to ongoing uncertainty about the merger, customers of Synacor or Qumu may delay or defer purchasing decisions or elect to switch to other suppliers. In particular, prospective customers could be reluctant to purchase the products and services of Synacor or the combined company due to uncertainty about the direction of the combined company\u2019s offerings and willingness to support existing products. To the extent that the merger creates uncertainty among those persons and organizations contemplating purchases such that customers delay, defer or change purchases in connection with the planned merger, the revenues of Synacor or the combined company would be adversely affected. Customer assurances may be made by Synacor and Qumu to address their customers\u2019 uncertainty about the direction of the combined company\u2019s product and related support offerings, which may result in additional obligations of Synacor or the combined company. As a result of any of these actions, quarterly revenues and other operating results of the combined company could be substantially below expectations of market analysts and a decline in the companies\u2019 respective stock prices could result.\nProvisions of the merger agreement may deter alternative business combinations and could negatively impact the stock prices of Synacor and Qumu if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.\nIn connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, each of Qumu and Synacor agreed to immediately cease all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons previously conducted with respect to certain acquisition proposals and acquisition transactions relating to Qumu and Synacor. The merger agreement prohibits Synacor and Qumu from soliciting, initiating, or knowingly encouraging or facilitating certain acquisition proposals with any third party, subject to exceptions set forth in the merger agreement. The merger agreement does not allow either Qumu or Synacor to terminate the merger agreement solely due to the receipt of an alternative acquisition proposal. The merger agreement also provides for the payment by Synacor of a termination fee of $2.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances (relating to, among other things, certain breaches of Synacor\u2019s no-shop obligations, failure by the Synacor board to recommend the merger, and failure by Synacor to bring the merger before a vote to the stockholders) in connection with a competing third party acquisition proposal for Synacor and for the payment by Qumu of a termination fee of $2.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances (relating to, among other things, certain breaches of Qumu\u2019s no-shop obligations, failure by the Qumu board to recommend the merger, and failure by Qumu to bring the merger before a vote to the stockholders) in connection with a competing third party acquisition proposal for Qumu. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to Synacor stockholders. The obligation to pay the termination fee also may discourage a third party from pursuing an acquisition proposal. If the merger agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we cannot assure our stockholders we they will be able to negotiate a transaction with another acquiror on terms comparable to the terms of the merger, or that we will avoid the termination fee associated with the termination of the merger agreement.\nIn the event the merger agreement is terminated by Synacor or Qumu in circumstances that obligate either party to pay the termination fee to the other party, including where either party terminates the merger agreement because the other party\u2019s board withdraws its support of the merger, our stock price may decline.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed transactions are pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, or otherwise pursue actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would be beneficial to Synacor. Such limitations could negatively affect each party\u2019s businesses, operations and financial condition prior to the completion of the merger.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial results and operations and the market price of Synacor common stock.\nWe have incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed merger, even if the merger is not completed. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of our attorneys, accountants, transaction advisors, and financial advisors. Also, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee to Qumu of $2 million. In the event that the proposed merger is not completed, these merger related costs may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the price of Synacor common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership among our directors and officers and their respective affiliates could limit our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key corporate decisions, such as an acquisition of our company.\nOur directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates, beneficially own or directly or indirectly control (including by voting proxy), as of March 3, 2020, approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock (including exercisable options). These stockholders, if they were to act together, would have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, if they act together, would have the ability to influence significantly the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the trading price of our common stock by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\n\u2022preventing the election of directors who are nominated by our stockholders; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of stockholders or others.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party will not make an unsolicited takeover proposal in the future or take other action to acquire control of us or to otherwise influence our management and policies. Considering and responding to any future proposal is likely to result in significant additional costs to us, and future acquisition proposals, other stockholder actions to acquire control and the litigation that often accompanies them, if any, are likely to be costly and time-consuming and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan.\nAdditionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors, may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce their reliance on the services we provide or decide to do business with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain of our stockholders who held shares of our preferred stock before the consummation of our public offering (and who now hold shares of our common stock) may be able to sell these shares in the public market without registration under Rule 144.\nIn addition, the shares that are either subject to outstanding options or warrants or that may be granted in the future under our equity plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements.\nIf a substantial number of any of these additional shares described are sold, or if it is perceived that a substantial number of such shares will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts, including:\n\u2022our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022our directors may only be removed for cause, and only with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote;\n\u2022only our board of directors and not our stockholders will be able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022only our chairman of the board, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors, and not our stockholders, are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders will be able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions and other provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in our control. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction could cause stockholders to lose a substantial premium over the then-current trading price of their shares. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing or to cause us to take other corporate actions such stockholders desire.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not historically paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we have agreed not to pay any dividends or make any other distributions in our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. We anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and cash resources for the future operation and development of our business, and as a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our capital stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the payment of any dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, bank covenants and other factors that our board may deem relevant. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in February 2012 at a price of $5.00 per share through the close of business on March 6, 2020, our trading price has ranged from $1.03 to $18.00. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to the various factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as:\n\u2022variations in our financial performance;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new services and products, strategic alliances, asset acquisitions, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022announcements of acquisitions of, or mergers with companies\n\u2022announcements regarding our existing customer contracts;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022adoption or modification of laws, regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business or announcements relating to these matters.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class actions filed against them. Such a suit filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with federal securities laws and regulations applicable to public companies, may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to attract and retain directors.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, impose additional requirements on public companies, including enhanced corporate governance practices. For example, the Nasdaq listing requirements require that listed companies satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors, audit committees, distribution of annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, stockholder approvals, solicitation of proxies, conflicts of interest, stockholder voting rights and codes of business conduct. Our management team has limited experience managing a publicly-traded company or complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. In addition, most of our current directors have limited experience serving on the boards of public companies.\nThe requirements of these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel must devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. In particular, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including remediating the material weaknesses described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d For example, we have assigned additional personnel within our finance department to the implementation, administration and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, and we engaged an outside public accounting firm to provide us with the services of accounting support personnel.\nMoreover, the rules and regulations applicable to public companies also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors, especially those directors who may be considered independent for purposes of Nasdaq rules, and officers may be significantly curtailed.", "PERMNO": 13280, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SYNC"}
