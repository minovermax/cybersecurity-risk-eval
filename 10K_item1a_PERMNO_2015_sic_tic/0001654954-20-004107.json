{"cik": "798081", "company": "LAKELAND INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks before investing in our common stock. These are not the only risks that we may face. If any of the events referred to below actually occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information in this Form 10-K and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry and Other Matters\nWe are subject to risk as a result of our international manufacturing operations.\nBecause most of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in China, Vietnam, Mexico, Argentina and India, our operations are subject to risk inherent in doing business internationally. Such risks include the adverse effects on operations from corruption, war, international terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, government activities such as border taxes and renegotiation of treaties, deprivation of contract and property rights and currency valuation changes.\nSince 1978, the Chinese government has been reforming its economic and political systems, and we expect this to continue. Although we believe that these reforms have had a positive effect on the economic development of China and have improved our ability to successfully operate our facilities in China, we cannot assure you that these reforms will continue or that the Chinese government will not take actions that impair our operations or assets in China. In addition, periods of international unrest may impede our ability to manufacture goods in other countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA terrorism attack, other geopolitical crisis, or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, could negatively impact our domestic and/or international operations.\nOur global operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.\nWe are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the recent COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 (\"COVID-19 virus\"), resulting in tens of thousands of confirmed cases identified around the world and in countries in which we conduct business. The outbreak has caused governments to implement quarantines, implement significant restrictions on travel, closed schools and work places, and implement work restrictions, all of which can impair normal business operations. Globally air travel has been significantly interrupted as has air freight, ocean freight, and even truck deliveries.\nAs a result of pandemic outbreaks, businesses can be shut down, supply chains can be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals can become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Governmental mandates may require forced shutdowns of our facilities for extended or indefinite periods. In addition, these widespread outbreaks of illness could adversely affect our workforce resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism. Pandemic outbreaks could also interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. If our operations are curtailed, we may have to shift manufacturing, if available, to another Lakeland facility which may be more expensive and limit our manufacturing capacity. Our Raw materials sources may not be available or may be delayed in shipments to us, impacting our ability to deliver to our customers, negatively impacting our operational results and financial condition . Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Poses Threat to Manufacturing Capacity and Temporary Disruption of Operations.\nWhile we have seen increased sales and order activity since the outbreak of COVID-19, we believe that some customers, distributors and end users alike, are stockpiling product and placing orders to assure a continued supply of garments through the duration of this event. The ability of our industry to ramp up production to meet demand, and how long the pandemic lasts, will have a direct impact on the amount of inventory remaining in distribution channels once the pandemic subsides. This factor, coupled with the possibility of economic recession, could have a deleterious impact on sales of disposable and chemical products for a significant period that could negatively impact our revenues, manufacturing efficiencies and subsequently our profitability. In order to mitigate this risk, we are attempting to increase market penetration in our existing disposable and chemical businesses and increase sales of non-COVID-19 impacted product lines (fire service, flame and arc flash garments, and high visibility) in order to secure new long term customers. Our ability to increase market penetration and grow non-COVID-19 product lines is predicated upon our continued ability to manufacturer at maximum capacity, however there can be no guarantees that our manufacturing will not be negatively impacted by the pandemic or government responses to it.\nThere is a risk that government responses to thwart the spread of the virus, in the form of local or regional quarantine or shelter-in-place orders, could require temporary curtailment of our manufacturing operations, or prevent the export of our products from the country of origin. In such cases, Lakeland\u2019s inability to deliver product would negatively impact sales and our contingency plans for post-COVID-19 recession with realization of the aforementioned negative impact on financial performance. The geographic dispersion of our manufacturing facilities, China, Vietnam, India, and Mexico reduces the likelihood that all facilities would be impacted simultaneously by such government response . The fact that personal protective equipment (PPE) (face masks, garments, gloves, and face protection) are in high demand globally for medical care and institutional cleaning will allow Lakeland to claim \u201cessential industry\u201d status, in the event of government imposed general industrial shutdown or quarantine. While such a claim may allow us to continue manufacturing, it may also result in a government restriction on export of our products, as government may seek local benefit from our continued operation. In such a case, our sales may suffer, depending on selling prices, and our ability to service other markets would likely be impeded as would our ability to increase market penetration and shift sales to other product lines.\nConsistent with our belief that we qualify as an \u201cessential industry\u201d in the countries where we manufacture and distribute products, we have taken actions to protect our work force and workplaces from the virus. We have restricted travel domestically and internationally, set up for our sales force to work remotely and have virtual customer meetings, implemented continuous disinfecting of our workplaces, and set up employees whose jobs allow it to work remotely. We have advised all of our employees in proper care and hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus. While these measures serve to reduce the possibility of transmission of the virus within our workplaces, they do not assure that our employees will not contract the virus or bring it into the workplace. Were such an event to be widespread enough, our manufacturing and/or distribution could be disrupted to varying degrees up to and including a shutdown, with the aforementioned deleterious impact on our financials and contingency planning for recession.\nOur results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our assembly arrangements with our foreign-based subsidiaries or third-party suppliers require payment to be made in US dollars or the Chinese RenminBi (\u201cRMB\u201d). Any decrease in the value of the US dollar or RMB in relation to foreign currencies could increase the cost of the services provided to us upon contract expirations or supply renegotiations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase product prices to offset any such cost increases, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks as a result of our sales to customers in foreign countries in the amount of $51.9 million in FY20. Our sales in these countries are usually denominated in the local currency. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to these local currencies, and we are unable to raise our prices proportionally, then our profit margins could decrease because of the exchange rate change.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries. To manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates, we seek to limit, to the extent possible, our non-US dollar denominated purchases and sales.\nIn connection with our operations in China, we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the United States. However, our purchases in China are primarily made in the RMB, the value of which has floated for the last 4 years, therefore we have been exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our Chinese raw material and component purchases.\nOur primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non-US dollar denominated sales in China, Canada and Europe and, to a smaller extent, in South American countries and in Russia. Our sales to customers in Canada are denominated in Canadian dollars, in Europe in Euros and British pounds, and in China in RMB and US dollars. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to the Canadian dollar, the Pound, the Euro, or the RMB then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange. We manage the foreign currency risk when appropriate through the use of rolling 90-day forward contracts against the Canadian dollar and Euro and through cash flow hedges in the US against the RMB and the Euro. We do not hedge other currencies at this time. In the event that non-US dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe may be exposed to continuing and other liabilities arising from our former Brazilian operations.\nAlthough we formally completed the terms of the \u201cShares Transfer Agreement\u201d, pursuant to which our entire equity interest in our former Brazilian subsidiary (\u201cLakeland Brazil\u201d) was transferred during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, we may continue to be exposed to certain liabilities arising in connection with the operations of Lakeland Brazil, which was shut down in late March 2019. We understand that under the laws of Brazil, a parent company may be held liable for the liabilities of a former Brazilian subsidiary in the event of fraud, misconduct, or under various theories. In this respect, as regards labor claims, a parent company could conceivably be held liable for the liabilities of a former Brazilian subsidiary. Although we would have the right of adversary system, full defense and due process, in case of a potential litigation, there can be no assurance as to the findings of the courts in Brazil. For this reason we have worked with Brazilian legal counsel to settle all open labor claims against the former subsidiary in order to mitigate this risk.\nThe implementation of our ERP system had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on operating results.\nWe suffered a net loss of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and the implementation on August 1, 2019 of our ERP system was a factor. Such software application enables us to better manage and interpret important parts of our business. Implementation is a complex task, often initially causing difficulties and adversely effecting operations of implementing companies. While we have completed three consecutive quarters of what we consider normal operational results, we have only implemented the ERP system in 50% of the Company, and there is risk with each implementation that is directly proportional to the percent of manufacturing conducted by, or the percent of revenue generated by the applicable foreign operation. Rollout to our foreign subsidiaries is scheduled to take place beginning in Q3 FY21 and continue through FY22.\nInFY20 we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. If we continue to fail maintaining proper and effective internal controls or are unable to remediate a material weakness in our internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis involves substantial effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO). As a result of this assessment, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to inventory valuation. A description of this material weakness can be found in Item 9A of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Upon our discovery of this material weakness, extensive procedures were performed to validate completeness and accuracy of underlying data and we determined and began implementation of a remediation plan.\nThese additional substantive procedures have allowed us to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements included in this Report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe may be adversely effected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union\nOur performance depends in part on general economic conditions affecting all countries in which we do business. In March 2017, the United Kingdom announced its decision to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The U.K.'s withdrawal was completed effective January 31, 2020. Our business in the U.K. and/or the E.U. may be adversely affected by the uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. Brexit and any uncertainty with respect thereto could adversely impact consumer demand and create significant currency fluctuations. In addition, we could be adversely impacted by changes in trade policies, labor, tax or other laws and regulations, intellectual property rights and supply chain logistics. We may incur additional costs as it addresses any such changes. All or any one of these factors could adversely affect our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results of operations have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future. These fluctuations may be caused by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nCurrency volatility\n\u25cf\nGlobal crisis, such as the Ebola outbreak, oil spills, or COVID 19;\n\u25cf\nOur expansion of international operations;\n\u25cf\nCompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nSeasonal buying patterns resulting from the cyclical nature of the business of some of our customers;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the mix of products and services sold;\n\u25cf\nThe timing of introductions and enhancements of products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nMarket acceptance of new products;\n\u25cf\nTechnological changes in fabrics or production equipment used to make our products;\n\u25cf\nAvailability of raw materials due to unanticipated demand or lack of precursors (oil and gas);\n\u25cf\nChanges in the mix of domestic and international sales;\n\u25cf\nPersonnel changes; and\nThese variations could negatively impact our stock price.\nSome of our sales are to foreign buyers, which exposes us to additional risks.\nWe derived approximately 48% of our net sales from customers located in foreign countries in FY20. We intend to seek to increase the amount of foreign sales we make in the future. The additional risks of foreign sales include:\n\u25cf\nPotential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nHigher credit risks;\n\u25cf\nRestrictive trade policies of the US foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nCurrency hyperinflation and weak banking institutions;\n\u25cf\nChanging economic conditions in local markets;\n\u25cf\nPolitical and economic instability in foreign markets;\n\u25cf\nChanges in leadership of foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nExport restrictions due to local states of emergency for disease or illness; and\nSome or all of these risks may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe deal in countries where corruption is an obstacle.\nWe must comply with American laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Sarbanes-Oxley and also with anticorruption legislation in the U.K. Some of our competitors and customers in foreign jurisdictions may not adhere to such legislation. As a result, we believe that we lose sales orders due to our strict adherence to such regulations.\nWe are exposed to tax expense risks.\nOn December 22, 2017, federal tax reform legislation was enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes from previous tax law. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act requires us to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, re-measuring our US deferred tax assets as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets. The Company completed this re-measurement and reassessment in FY18. While the Tax Act provides for a modified territorial tax system, beginning in 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) provisions. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary\u2019s tangible assets. The proposed regulations were not finalized as of January 31, 2019. The regulations were finalized as of June 14, 2019. Re-measurement and reassessment of the GILTI tax as it is currently written resulted in a charge to tax expense of $1.0 million for FY20 and $0.6 million for FY19. The Company intends to account for the GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred. Though this non-cash expense had a materially negative impact on FY20 earnings, the Tax Act also changes the taxation of foreign earnings, and companies generally will not be subject to United States federal income taxes upon the receipt of dividends from foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company claimed a worthless stock deduction in connection with our exit from Brazil which generated a tax benefit of approximately US $9.5 million in its fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. While, along with our tax advisors, we believe that this deduction is valid, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge it and, if challenged, there is no assurance that the Company will prevail.\nCovenants in our credit facilities may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs a result of the Loan Agreement the Company entered into on May 10, 2017 we currently have a $20 million revolving credit facility, expiring May 10, 2020. Our credit facility requires, and any future credit facilities may also require, among others that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage and maximum capital expenditures. Our ability to satisfy these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the requirements of these covenants. These restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business, including a limitation on annual investments and advances we can make to foreign subsidiaries. Default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. Our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our current credit facilities, and it is likely that our future lenders will have security interests in our assets. If our lenders declare amounts outstanding under any credit facility to be due, the lenders could proceed against our assets. Any event of default, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The Company is currently negotiating with a prospective lender to replace the current Loan Agreement. We cannot be certain that those negotiations will be successful or that the terms of any arrangement will be any more favorable than those under the current Loan Agreement.\nBecause we do not have long-term commitments from many of our customers, we must estimate customer demand, and errors in our estimates could negatively impact our inventory levels and net sales.\nOur sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, which may later be modified or canceled by the customer, rather than on long-term commitments. We have historically been required to place firm orders for fabrics and components with our suppliers prior to receiving an order for our products, based on our forecasts of customer demands. Our sales process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates, causing excess inventory to accrue or a lack of manufacturing capacity when needed. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to or not at all. As a result, we would have excess inventory, which would negatively impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would lose sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to delivery dates required by our customers because of the lead time needed for us to obtain required materials or to send fabrics to our assembly facilities in China, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. We must recruit and retain skilled employees, including our senior management, to succeed in our business.\nWe face competition from other companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources than we do.\nFour of our competitors, DuPont, Honeywell, Ansell and Kimberly Clark, have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do. In addition, we believe that the barriers to entry in the disposable and reusable garments and gloves markets are relatively low. We cannot assure you that our present competitors or competitors that choose to enter the marketplace in the future will not exert significant competitive pressures. Such competition could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent upon key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel, including Charles D. Roberson, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, Allen E. Dillard, our Chief Financial Officer, Daniel L. Edwards, our Senior Vice President Sales for North America and Christopher J. Ryan, our Executive Chairman. The loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any future expansion of our business will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, marketing, customer service and manufacturing personnel, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological change could negatively affect sales of our products and our performance.\nThe rapid development of fabric technology continually affects our apparel applications and may directly impact the performance of our products. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain or improve the effectiveness of our existing products, nor can we assure you that we will successfully identify new opportunities or continue to have the needed financial resources to develop new fabric or apparel manufacturing techniques in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, products manufactured by others may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. If any of these events occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, management training, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. While no cybersecurity attack to date has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the threat remains and the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these claims.\nWe manufacture products used for protection from hazardous or potentially lethal substances, such as chemical and biological toxins, fire, viruses and bacteria. The products that we manufacture are typically used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury. Failure to use our products for their intended purposes, failure to use our products properly or the malfunction of our products could result in serious bodily injury or death of the user. In such cases, we may be subject to product liability claims arising from the design, manufacture or sale of our products. If these claims are decided against us, and we are found to be liable, we may be required to pay substantial damages, and our insurance costs may increase significantly as a result. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim. In addition, we cannot assure you that this or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, that we will be able to obtain it at a reasonable cost. Any material uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur US operations, including our manufacturing facilities, are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. Any violation of any of those laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial liability to the Environmental Protection Agency, the state environmental agencies in any affected state or to any individuals affected by any such violation. If hazardous substances are released from or located on any of our properties, we could incur substantial costs and damages. Any such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur directors and executive officers have the ability to exert significant influence on our Company and on matters subject to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs of January 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned or could vote approximately 6.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of their ownership of common stock and their positions in our Company, our directors and executive officers are able to exert significant influence on our Company and on matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. In particular, as of January 31, 2020, Christopher J. Ryan, our Executive Chairman, beneficially owned or votes approximately 5.4% of our common stock. The ownership interests of our directors and executive officers, including Mr. Ryan, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company that may be favored by our stockholders generally.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation contains classified board provisions, authorized preferred stock that could be utilized to implement various \u201cpoison pill\u201d defenses and a stockholder authorized, but as yet unused, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d), all of which may have the effect of discouraging a takeover of Lakeland, which is not approved by our board of directors. Further, we are subject to the antitakeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner.\nAcquisitions could be unsuccessful.\nIn the future, subject to capital constraints, we may seek to acquire selected safety products lines or safety-related businesses which will complement our existing products. Our ability to acquire these businesses is dependent upon many factors, including our management\u2019s relationship with the owners of these businesses, many of which are small and closely held by individual stockholders. In addition, we will be competing for acquisition and expansion opportunities with other companies, many of which have greater name recognition, marketing support and financial resources than us, which may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, as well as higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, pursue or acquire any targeted business and, if acquired, there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired business into our Company without substantial costs, delays and other operational or financial problems.\nIf we proceed with additional acquisitions for cash, we may use a substantial portion of our available line of credit (if available) in order to consummate any such acquisition. We may also seek to finance any such acquisition through debt or equity financings, and there can be no assurance that such financings will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If consideration for an acquisition consists of equity securities, the stock held by our investors could be diluted. If we borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition, we may not be able to obtain such funds on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, such indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business as we currently intend because of restrictions placed on us under the terms of the indebtedness and because we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on the debt instead of to our operations, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks in addition to those mentioned above, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, potential exposure to unknown liabilities, adverse effects on our reported operating results and the amortization or write-down of acquired intangible assets. We cannot assure you that any acquisition by us will or will not occur, that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business. To the extent that we are unable to manage growth efficiently and effectively or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need additional funds, and if we are unable to obtain these funds, we may not be able to expand or operate our business as planned.\nOur operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to seek additional capital, whether from sales of equity or by borrowing money, to fund acquisitions for the future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn.\nA number of factors could affect our ability to access future debt or equity financing, including:\n\u25cf\nOur financial condition, strength and credit rating;\n\u25cf\nThe financial markets\u2019 confidence in our management team and financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic conditions and the conditions in the homeland security and Energy sectors; and\n\u25cf\nCapital markets conditions.\nEven if available, additional financing may be more costly than our current facility and may have adverse consequences. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. Although management believes it currently has sufficient capital, if we do need additional capital in the future and are unsuccessful, it could reduce our net sales and materially adversely impact our earning capability and financial position.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results, announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and other events or factors. For example, a shortfall in net sales or net income, or an increase in losses, from levels expected by securities analysts or investors, could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nOur common stock is an equity interest and therefore subordinated to our indebtedness.\nPayments of the principal and interest under the notes issued under the loan agreements entered into in connection with our senior financing are secured by liens on, and security interests in, substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 present and after-acquired assets. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock would rank below all debt and creditor claims against us. As a result, holders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up until after all of our obligations to our debt holders and creditors have been satisfied.\nWe are precluded from paying and do not anticipate paying any dividends to our common stockholders in the near future.\nWe are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends to our common stockholders without the prior consent of our lenders. Further, we have not paid dividends on our common stock since August 2006 and we do not anticipate, if permitted, paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations.", "PERMNO": 10645, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "LAKE"}
