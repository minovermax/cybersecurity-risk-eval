RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within the Company\u2019s control, which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Investors should consider carefully information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in light of the risk factors described below.\nOperational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could further materially adversely affect our business, workforce, supply chain, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, a global pandemic. Governments across the world have implemented numerous measures to attempt to contain or lessen the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their populations, such as travel bans, quarantines, shut-downs and shelter in place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the current and future measures directed toward it, has resulted in significant uncertainty in capital markets and negatively impacted global economies and markets. The pandemic has negatively impacted, and is likely to continue to negatively impact, our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has reduced demand for access equipment, refuse collection vehicles and concrete mixers and may reduce demand for other products. Furthermore, because working remotely has become more prevalent and accepted as a result of the pandemic, companies could determine that it will be acceptable for employees to work from their homes on a long-term basis, which could reduce demand for future nonresidential construction, which in turn could further reduce demand for access equipment and concrete mixers.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have prevented some customers in our Fire & Emergency segment from inspecting and accepting vehicles on a timely basis.\n\u2022\nOur customers may experience financial hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic that could result in lower demand for our products and/or default on financial and other commitments to us.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our workforce and business as a result of impacts associated with required, preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments are taking. These impacts include our requiring certain employees to work from home, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, reducing employee travel and adopting other employee safety measures. These measures have also impacted, and in the future may impact, our ability to meet production demands or requests depending on employee attendance or ability to continue to work. Restrictions on, as well as the health of, our workforce could limit our ability to support our business, as it did in our Defense and Fire & Emergency segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as workforce absenteeism rose at certain facilities located in communities experiencing higher rates of COVID-19.\n\u2022\nWe operate a global supply chain that has been, and could in the future continue to be, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in delays or inefficiencies in production. Some of our suppliers have limited, and may in the future limit, their production or shut down due to shelter-in-place requirements, sanitizing facilities and workforce availability issues. While we have generally been successful in mitigating these supply chain challenges, supplier parts shortages lowered our production rates in the Fire & Emergency segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and it is possible that a part or component shortage could limit our production in the future.\n\u2022\nGovernment or regulatory responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted, and are likely to continue to negatively impact, our business. Mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations may disrupt our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in some markets. Governments may continue to impose travel restrictions and close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict business activity, which could impact our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and services, limit the ability of our suppliers to provide us with products, or hamper our products from moving through the supply chain.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which depending on future developments could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. Although we believe our balance sheet remains strong, we have been focused on preserving capital resources given the uncertain duration of the pandemic, and in an attempt to maintain strong liquidity, the Company temporarily paused its share repurchase program and implemented other cost reduction actions, there is no certainty that measures we have taken will be effective to enable us to maintain adequate resources and liquidity.\nThe impacts that we list above and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flow, is dependent, among other things, on the duration and severity of the pandemic, the effect of actions taken by government authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on global economies, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. We cannot at this time predict the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, but it could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, workforce, supply chain, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve. If we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop new products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of brand awareness, product innovation, performance, quality, reliability, availability, price, service and support, ability to meet customer specifications and the extent to which a company offers single-source customer solutions. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and governmental affairs resources than we do, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. If competition in our industry intensifies or if our current competitors lower their prices for competing products, we may lose sales or be required to lower the prices we charge for our products. We cannot provide any assurance that our products will continue to compete effectively with the products of competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers.\nOne of our growth strategies is emphasizing our new product development as we seek to expand sales and margins by leading our core markets in the introduction of new or improved products and technologies. Our ability to match product improvements and new product offerings to diverse global customers\u2019 anticipated needs for different types of products and various product features and functions, at acceptable prices, is critical to our success. We may not be able to compete as effectively and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to improve existing products and develop new innovative products in the global markets in which we compete. While we spent $103.9 million, $99.0 million and $98.0 million for research and development in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we cannot provide any assurance that this level of investment in research and development will be sufficient to maintain our competitive strength in product innovation, which could cause our business to suffer. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may arrive in the market before our products arrive and be more attractive with more features and functions and/or lower prices than our\nproducts. If we are unable to provide continued technological improvements in our products that meet our customers\u2019 or the industry\u2019s expectations, then the demand for our products could be substantially adversely affected.\nOur dependency on contracts with U.S. and foreign government agencies subjects us to a variety of risks that could materially reduce our revenues or profits.\nWe are dependent on U.S. and foreign government contracts for a substantial portion of our business. Approximately 35% of our sales in fiscal 2020 were to the DoD. That business is subject to the following risks, among others, that could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance:\n\u2022\nOur business is susceptible to changes in the annual U.S. defense budget, which changes may reduce revenues that we expect from our defense business, especially in light of federal budget pressures, lower levels of U.S. ground troops deployed in foreign conflicts, sequestration and the level of defense funding that will be allocated to the DoD\u2019s tactical wheeled vehicle strategy generally.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. government may not budget for or appropriate funding that we expect for our U.S. government contracts, which may prevent us from realizing revenues under current contracts or receiving additional orders that we anticipate we will receive. The DoD could also seek to reprogram certain funds originally planned for the purchase of vehicles we manufacture under the current defense budget allocations. The U.S. Army has identified its top modernization and readiness priorities, which could result in the customer re-programming funds away from the Company\u2019s JLTV program to support these initiatives.\n\u2022\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation process. In years when the U.S. government has not completed its budget process before the end of its fiscal year including currently, government operations are typically funded pursuant to a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of the products, services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being delayed or canceled, or funds could be reprogrammed away from our programs to pay for higher priority operational needs. The U.S. government is currently operating under a continuing resolution budget that funds the federal government through December 11, 2020. Furthermore, in years when the U.S. government fails to complete its budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution, a federal government shutdown may result. This could in turn result in the delay or cancellation of key programs, which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results. In addition, payments to contractors for services performed during a federal government shutdown may be delayed, which would have a negative effect on our cash flows.\n\u2022\nCertain of our government contracts for the DoD could be delayed or terminated, and all such contracts expire in the future and may not be replaced, which could reduce revenues that we expect under the contracts and negatively affect margins in our Defense segment.\n\u2022\nThe Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act and the Competition in Contracting Act require competition for U.S. defense programs in most circumstances. Competition for DoD programs that we currently have could result in the U.S. government awarding future contracts to another manufacturer or the U.S. government awarding the contracts to us at lower prices and operating margins than we experience under the current contracts.\n\u2022\nCompetitions for the award of defense tactical wheeled vehicle contracts are intense, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in the defense tactical wheeled vehicle procurement competitions in which we participate. In addition, the U.S. government has become more aggressive in seeking to acquire the design rights to the Company\u2019s current and potential future programs to facilitate competition for manufacturing our vehicles. The willingness of bidders to license their design rights to the DoD was an evaluation factor in the JLTV and FMTV A2 competitions.\n\u2022\nDefense tactical wheeled vehicles contract awards that we receive may be subject to protests or lawsuits by competing bidders, which protests or lawsuits, if successful, could result in the DoD revoking part or all of any defense tactical wheeled vehicle contracts it awards to us and our inability to recover amounts we have expended in anticipation of initiating production under any such contract.\n\u2022\nWe must spend significant sums on product development and testing, bid and proposal activities, and pre-contract engineering, tooling and design activities in competitions to have the opportunity to be awarded these contracts.\n\u2022\nAs a U.S. government contractor, our U.S. government contracts and systems are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency. These agencies review our performance under our U.S. government contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to U.S. government contractors. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems, estimating systems, material management systems, earned value management systems, purchasing systems and government property systems. If improper or illegal activities, errors or system inadequacies come to the attention of the U.S. government, as a result of an audit or otherwise, then we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, contract adjustments and/or agreements to upgrade existing systems as well as administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our U.S. government contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and, under certain circumstances, suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracts for a period of time. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged and regardless of materiality, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. These laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in many instances, impose added costs on our business.\n\u2022\nOur Defense business may fluctuate significantly from time to time as a result of the start and completion of existing and new domestic and international contract awards that we may receive. Our defense tactical wheeled vehicle contracts are large in size and require significant personnel and production resources, and when our defense tactical wheeled vehicle customers allow such contracts to expire or significantly reduce their vehicle requirements under such contracts, we must make adjustments to personnel and production resources. The start and completion of existing and new contract awards that we may receive can cause our Defense business to fluctuate significantly.\n\u2022\nWe may face uncertainty regarding the timing of funding or payments on international defense tactical wheeled vehicle contract awards that we may receive.\n\u2022\nWe periodically experience difficulties with sourcing sufficient vehicle carcasses from the U.S. military to maintain our defense tactical wheeled vehicles remanufacturing schedule, which can create uncertainty and inefficiencies for this area of our business.\nRaw material price fluctuations may adversely affect our results.\nWe purchase, directly and indirectly through component purchases, significant amounts of steel, aluminum, petroleum-based products and other commodities. Steel, aluminum, fuel and other commodity prices have historically been highly volatile. While steel and aluminum costs are currently within historical norms, U.S. steel plate prices spiked 50% from the end of our fiscal 2017 through January 2019. Costs for these items may increase again in the future due to one or more of the following: a sustained economic recovery, the level of tariffs that the U.S. imposes on imported steel and aluminum, including Section 232 tariffs, or a weakening U.S. dollar. Increases in commodity costs, such as those driven by the Section 232 tariffs, negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on those orders are usually fixed. If we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through surcharges or permanent price increases to our customers, then such increases will have an adverse effect on our financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows. Furthermore, surcharges and permanent price increases may not be accepted by our customers, resulting in them choosing to order from our competitors instead of us or delaying orders to us. Any significant decrease in orders could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, profitability and/or cash flow. Additionally, if commodity costs decrease and we are unable to negotiate timely component cost decreases commensurate with any decrease in commodity costs, then our higher component prices could put us at a material disadvantage as compared to our competition which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nMost of our contracts with the DoD in the Defense segment are multi-year firm, fixed-price contracts. These contracts typically contain annual sales price increases. Under the JLTV contract, we bear the risk of material, labor and overhead cost escalation for the full eight years of the contract, which is three to five years longer than has been the case under our other defense contracts. We attempt to limit the risk related to raw material price fluctuations on prices for major defense components by obtaining firm pricing from suppliers at the time a contract is awarded. However, if these suppliers do not honor their contracts, then we could face margin pressure. Furthermore, if our actual costs on any of these contracts exceed our projected costs, it could result in profits lower than historically realized or than we anticipate or net losses under these contracts.\nWe are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price increases.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant disruption or termination of the supply of some of our parts, materials, components and final assemblies that we obtain from sole source suppliers or subcontractors. Delays in obtaining parts, materials, components and final assemblies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints, labor shortages or disputes, supplier product quality issues, suppliers\u2019 impaired financial condition and suppliers\u2019 allocation to other purchasers. These risks are increased in a weak economic environment and when demand increases coming out of an economic downturn.\nWe may incur a significant increase in the costs of parts, materials, components or final assemblies. Factors such as supply and demand, freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties and tariffs, including Section 301 tariffs that the U.S. imposes on goods and materials imported from China and other countries, and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these parts, materials components or final assemblies. Such disruptions, terminations or cost increases have resulted and could further result in manufacturing inefficiencies due to us having to wait for parts to arrive on the production line, could delay sales and could result in a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers of engines and other power sources to continue to timely deliver power sources that meet applicable emissions regulations and customer preferences. If we fail to have adequate relationships with suppliers that will supply appropriate engines and other power sources to us or fail to timely receive appropriate power sources from our suppliers, that could result in our being placed in an uncompetitive position or without finished product when needed.\nWe expect to incur costs and charges as a result of restructuring of facilities or operations that we expect will reduce on-going costs. These actions may be disruptive to our business and may not result in anticipated cost savings.\nPeriodically we restructure facilities and operations in an effort to make our business more efficient, such as the closure of our Medias, Romania and Riverside, California facilities in our Access Equipment segment that we announced at the end of June 2020 and the relocation of concrete mixer production from our Dodge Center, Minnesota facility within our Commercial segment that was announced in July 2020. We have incurred costs, asset impairments and restructuring charges in connection with such restructuring activities, workforce reductions and other cost reduction measures, and in the future, may incur additional such costs that would adversely affect our future earnings and cash flows. Such actions may be disruptive to our business. This may result in production inefficiencies, product quality issues, late product deliveries or lost orders as we begin production at consolidated facilities or outsource activities to third parties, which would adversely impact our sales levels, operating results and operating margins. Furthermore, we may not realize the cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of such actions.\nOur results could be adversely affected by severe weather, natural disasters, and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations prone to severe weather and natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations. Our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. Severe weather or a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers could delay delivery of parts, materials or components to us or sales to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nConcrete mixer and access equipment sales also are seasonal with the majority of such sales occurring in the spring and summer months, which constitute the traditional construction season in the Northern hemisphere. The timing of orders for the traditional construction season in the Northern hemisphere can be impacted by weather conditions.\nDisruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we sell the majority of our products directly to the end user, we market, sell and service products through a network of independent dealers in the Fire & Emergency segment and in a limited number of markets for the Access Equipment and Commercial segments. As a result, our business with respect to these products is influenced by our ability to establish and manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our independent dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors, or as a result of an alleged failure by us or an independent dealer to comply with the terms of our dealer agreement. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business. However, disruption of dealer coverage within a specific state or other geographic market could cause difficulties in marketing, selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn addition, our ability to terminate our relationship with a dealer is limited due to state dealer laws, which generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with required notices. Under many state laws, dealers may protest termination notices or petition for relief from termination actions. Responding to these protests and petitions may cause us to incur costs and, in some instances, could lead to litigation resulting in lost opportunities with other dealers or lost sales opportunities, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nStrategic Risks\nOur markets are highly cyclical. Declines in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.\nThe access equipment market is highly cyclical and impacted (i) by the strength of economies in general and customers\u2019 perceptions concerning the timing of economic cycles, (ii) by residential and non-residential construction spending, (iii) by the ability of rental companies to obtain third-party financing to purchase revenue generating assets, (iv) by capital expenditures of rental companies in general, including the rate at which they replace aged rental equipment, which is impacted in part by historical purchase levels, (v) by the timing of regulatory standard changes, and (vi) by other factors, including oil and gas related activity. Refuse collection vehicle markets are also cyclical and impacted by the strength of economies in general, by municipal tax receipts and by the size and timing of capital expenditures, including replacement demand, by large waste haulers. The ready-mix concrete market that we serve is highly cyclical and impacted by the strength of the economy generally, by the number of housing starts and by other factors that may have an effect on the level of concrete placement activity, either regionally or nationally. Fire & emergency markets are cyclical later in an economic cycle and are impacted by the economy generally and by municipal tax receipts and capital expenditures. We expect that municipal budgets may be constrained in the next several quarters, which could cause a decline in the North American fire truck market.\nLower U.S. housing starts since fiscal 2008 have had a negative impact on sales volumes for our concrete placement products. Despite U.S. residential construction growth, housing starts remain below historical 30-year averages. We believe concrete mixer customers have maintained a cautious approach to fleet replacement/expansion, generally wanting to confirm that construction activity in the U.S. will support solid fleet utilization. A lack of sustained improvement in residential construction spending generally may result in our inability to achieve our sales expectations or cause future weakness in demand for our products. We cannot provide any assurance that the housing recovery will not progress even more slowly than what we or the market expect. If the housing recovery progresses more slowly than what we or the market expect, then there could be an adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nOur objective is to expand international operations and sales\nExpanding international operations and sales is a significant part of our growth strategy. International operations and sales are subject to various risks, including political, religious and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs upon our products (which include tariffs in response to tariffs that the U.S. imposes) and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding taxes, sporadic order patterns, governmental expropriation, uncertainties or delays in collection of accounts receivable and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs, including increased supply chain costs, and experience delays or disruptions in production schedules, product deliveries or payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings. Among other things, there are additional logistical requirements associated with international sales,\nwhich increase the amount of time between the completion of vehicle production and our ability to recognize related revenue. In addition, expansion into foreign markets requires the establishment of distribution networks and may require modification of products to meet local requirements or preferences. Establishment of distribution networks or modification to the design of our products to meet local requirements and preferences may take longer or be more costly than we anticipate and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve international sales growth. In addition, our entry into certain markets that we wish to enter may require us to establish a joint venture. Identifying an appropriate joint venture partner and creating a joint venture could be more time consuming, more costly and more difficult than we anticipate.\nWe may not be able to execute on our MOVE strategy.\nMOVE is our strategy to deliver long-term growth and earnings for our shareholders. We cannot provide any assurance we will be able to continue to successfully execute our MOVE strategy due to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur inability to adopt the use of standard processes and tools to drive improved customer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nOur inability to expand our aftermarket parts and service availability;\n\u2022\nOur inability to improve our product quality;\n\u2022\nOur inability to improve margins through simplification actions;\n\u2022\nOur failure to realize product, process and overhead cost reduction targets;\n\u2022\nOur inability to design new products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements and bring them to market;\n\u2022\nHigher costs than anticipated to launch new products or delays in new product launches; and\n\u2022\nSlow adoption of our products in emerging markets and/or our inability to successfully execute our emerging market growth strategy.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates associated with our non-U.S. operations that could adversely affect our results of operations and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nApproximately 14% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 were attributable to products sold outside of the United States, of which approximately 51% involved export sales from the United States. The majority of export sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales that originate outside the United States are typically transacted in the local currencies of those countries. Fluctuations in foreign currency can have an adverse impact on our sales and profits as amounts that are measured in foreign currency are translated back to U.S. dollars. We have sales of inventory denominated in U.S. dollars to certain of our subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The exchange rates between many of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Such fluctuations, in particular those with respect to the Euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling, may have a material effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. In addition, any appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency of those countries where our products are sold will increase our costs of goods in our foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in U.S. dollars, and impact the competitiveness of our product offerings in international markets.\nWe are subject to changes in contract estimates\nWe account for substantially all long-term contracts with the DoD utilizing the cost-to-cost method of percentage-of-completion accounting. This accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions regarding the timing of receipt of delivery orders from our government customer and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of these contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs is complicated and subject to many variables. We must make assumptions regarding expected increases in wages and employee benefits, productivity and availability of labor, material costs and allocated fixed costs. Changes to production costs, overhead rates, learning curve and/or supplier performance can also impact these estimates. Furthermore, under the revenue recognition accounting rules, we can only\ninclude units in our estimates of overall contract profitability after we have received a firm delivery order for those units. Because new orders have the potential to significantly change the overall profitability of cumulative orders received to date, particularly early in the contract when fewer overall units are on order, the period in which we receive those orders from the government will impact the estimated life-to-date contract profitability. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nWe may experience losses in excess of our recorded reserves for doubtful accounts, finance receivables, notes receivable and guarantees of indebtedness of others.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had consolidated gross receivables of $875.7 million. In addition, we were subject to obligations to guarantee customer indebtedness to third parties of $749.8 million, under which we estimate our maximum exposure to be $150.2 million. We evaluate the collectability of open accounts, finance receivables, notes receivable and our guarantees of indebtedness of others based on a combination of factors and establish reserves based on our estimates of potential losses. In circumstances where we believe it is probable that a specific customer will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we expect to collect, and/or we recognize a liability for a guarantee we expect to pay, taking into account any amounts that we would anticipate realizing if we are forced to repossess the equipment that supports the customer\u2019s financial obligations to us. We also establish additional reserves based upon our perception of the quality of the current receivables, the current financial position of our customers and past collections experience. Prolonged or more severe economic weakness may result in additional requirements for specific reserves. During periods of economic weakness, the collateral underlying our guarantees of indebtedness of customers or receivables can decline sharply, thereby increasing our exposure to losses. We also face a concentration of credit risk as the Access Equipment segment\u2019s ten largest debtors at September 30, 2020 represented approximately 42% of our consolidated gross receivables. Some of these customers are highly leveraged. We may incur losses in excess of our recorded reserves if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or the full amount of any anticipated proceeds from the sale of the collateral supporting our customers\u2019 financial obligations is not realized. Our cash flows and overall liquidity may be materially adversely affected if any of the financial institutions that finance our customer receivables become unable or unwilling, due to unfavorable economic conditions, a weakening of our or their financial position or otherwise, to continue providing such credit.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. At September 30, 2020, approximately 90% of these intangibles were concentrated in the Access Equipment segment. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if potential interim indicators exist that could result in impairment. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a decline in economic conditions or a slow, weak economic recovery, a sustained decline in the price of our common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of our products, adverse changes in interest rates, or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that we expect. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit includes developing estimates which are highly subjective and incorporate calculations that are sensitive to minor changes in underlying assumptions. Management\u2019s assumptions change as more information becomes available. Changes in these events and conditions or other assumptions could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.\nFinancing costs and restrictive covenants in our current debt facilities could limit our flexibility in managing our business and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur credit agreement contains financial and restrictive covenants which, among other things, require us to satisfy quarter-end financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial ratios in such covenants may be affected by a number of risks or events, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and events beyond our control. The indenture governing our senior notes also contain restrictive covenants. Any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants or the financial and restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and debt service capability.\nOur access to debt financing at competitive risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our credit ratings. Our current long-term credit ratings are BBB with \u201cnegative\u201d outlook from S&P Global Ratings, Baa3 with \u201cstable\u201d outlook from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and BBB- with \u201cstable\u201d outlook from Fitch Ratings. A downgrade to our credit ratings could increase our interest rates, could limit our access to public debt markets, could limit the institutions willing to provide us credit facilities, and could make any future credit facilities or credit facility amendments more costly and/or difficult to obtain. In addition, a portion of our debt is subject to variable interest rates. An increase in general interest rates would also increase our cost of borrowing under our credit agreement.\nWe had $825 million of long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Our ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, political and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. As we discussed previously, our dependency on contracts with U.S. and foreign government agencies subjects us to a variety of risks that, if realized, could materially reduce our revenues, profits and cash flows. Accordingly, conditions could arise that could limit our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or access borrowings to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, further limit our financial flexibility or impair our ability to obtain alternative financing sufficient to repay our debt at maturity.\nThe covenants in our credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes, our credit rating, our current debt levels and the current credit market conditions could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022\nRender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions in our highly cyclical markets or economies generally;\n\u2022\nRequire us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest costs or required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, share repurchases, dividends and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund growth, working capital, capital expenditures, new product development expenses and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nMake us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our debt under our credit agreement is at variable rates;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets we serve; and\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions that may become available in our markets or otherwise capitalize on business opportunities if we had additional borrowing capacity.\nLegal, Regulatory & Compliance Risks\nOur international sales and operations subject us to risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a result of our international operations and sales, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. Any violations of the FCPA could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including our business with the U.S. government. We are also increasingly subject to export control regulations, including, without limitation, the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory or business climate could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.\nChanges in regulations could adversely affect our business. The need to develop products that generate less greenhouse gas emissions is one specific competitive challenge.\nBoth our products and the operation of our manufacturing facilities are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. These include environmental requirements applicable to manufacturing and vehicle emissions, government contracting regulations, regulations impacting our supply chain and domestic and international trade regulations. A significant change to these regulatory requirements could substantially increase manufacturing costs or impact the size or timing of demand for our products, all of which could make our business results more variable.\nIn particular, many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Congress has previously considered and may in the future implement restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where we have manufacturing plants, are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our business, operations or financial results.\nIn response to changes in customer preferences concerning global climate changes and related changes in regulations, we may face greater pressure to develop products that generate less greenhouse gas emissions. Many manufacturers foresee sales of electric-powered vehicles and mobile equipment becoming increasingly important to their businesses, and we may not have the expertise or resources to successfully address these pressures on a cost-effective basis or at all. While we are continuing to explore options to offer more propulsion choices in our products, such as electric-powered vehicles or mobile equipment, with lower emissions, this may require us to spend additional funds on product research and development and implementation costs and subject us to the risk that our competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric-powered vehicles or mobile equipment and other technologies that minimize emissions, competition from others could make our specialty vehicles or mobile equipment less desirable in the marketplace.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nSecurity threats via computer malware and other \u201ccyber-attacks\u201d are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. As a defense contractor, we face many cyber and security threats that can range from attacks common to most industries, which could have financial or reputational consequences, to advanced persistent threats on our Defense business, which could involve information that is considered a matter of national security. These threats may include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information system and networks, which we use to collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including information about our business, our customers and employees. The technology within our products also presents a risk to our customers that if compromised could have negative implications on the Company. As technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect, store and embed even more data capabilities in our systems and products that are sensitive to both willful and unintentional security breaches. We have designed our processes and controls to monitor and mitigate against such risks. However, there can be no assurance that these processes and controls will be sufficient to prevent such attacks. In the event of a breach in security, it may lead to customers purchasing products from our competitors, subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement, disrupt our operations or harm employee wellbeing and/or morale.\nIn addition, we could be impacted by cyber threats, disruptions or vulnerabilities of our suppliers and customers. The costs of maintaining robust information security mechanisms and controls are increasing and are likely to increase further in the future. We are unable to predict the impact of a security breach at this time.", "PERMNO": 90756, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "OSK"}
