{"cik": "1052595", "company": "Red Lion Hotels CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks, including those set forth below, that could have a negative effect on our financial condition and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report or other RLH Corporation communications.\nOur asset-light business model, which relies on revenue from franchise hotel agreements, is subject to a number of risks.\nOur business strategy to operate as primarily a franchise company means we are reliant in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees. Our franchise business generates revenue from royalty, marketing, and other fees that are primarily based on a percentage of room revenue, on room count or on transaction count. Therefore, if our franchisees experience flat or declining room revenues, or face challenges which reduce room count, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result.\nThe size of our largest franchisees creates additional risk due to our dependence on their particular growth, financial and operating performance and cooperation and alignment with our brand standards and initiatives. Should one of these franchisees leave our system, experience financial or other difficulties, or file for bankruptcy, it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition.\nIn addition, our franchise agreements require that franchisees comply with certain brand standards that help maintain the quality and reputation of our brands. If our franchisees fail to make the investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties in accordance with our brand standards, guest preference for our brands could diminish, which could cause a negative impact on our revenues, ability to recruit new hotels to our brands, and negatively affect our overall results of operations. In addition, if our franchisees fail to observe our brand standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts.\nIn addition, although we should not be liable for the acts of our independently-owned franchisees, it is possible that a court may not recognize the legal distinction between Red Lion Hotels Corporation and its franchisees, and hold us liable for a franchisee\u2019s violation of applicable laws or regulations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying and completing acquisitions of new franchised hotel agreements, renewal of franchise hotel agreements and expanding our brands through acquisitions, which could limit our ability to implement our growth strategy and result in significant expense.\nWe are continuing to pursue the expansion of our franchise operations in markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets. We are also pursuing expansion of our RLH Corporation brands into targeted segments. Franchised hotels carry one of the RLH Corporation brands, and we may consider adding additional brand options in the future.\nThe growth of our franchise business will require considerable management time, as well as expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our objectives with respect to growing the number of franchised hotels in our system or that we will be able to attract qualified franchisees, or that the franchisees we add to our system will be profitable.\nThe growth in the number of franchised hotels is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control. Among other risks, the following factors affect our ability to achieve growth in the number of franchised hotels:\n\u2022Competition with other hotel companies, many of which have more franchised hotels in their systems and more resources to assist owners of new franchised hotels with capital expenditures needed to satisfy brand standards;\n\u2022Our ability to compete with other hotel companies on franchise and royalty fees;\n\u2022Our ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees under one or more of our brands;\n\u2022The recognition in the market and the reputation of the RLH Corporation brands;\n\u2022Access to financial resources necessary to acquire new brands or hotels;\n\u2022The ability of the owners of franchised hotels to maintain brand standards and to open and operate additional hotels profitably. Factors affecting the opening of new hotels, or the conversion of existing hotels to RLH Corporation brands, include among others:\n\u2022The availability of hotel management, staff and other personnel;\n\u2022The cost and availability of suitable hotel locations;\n\u2022The availability and cost of capital to allow hotel owners and developers to fund investments;\n\u2022Cost effective and timely construction and renovation of hotels (which can be delayed due to, among other reasons, labor and materials availability, labor disputes, local zoning and licensing matters, and weather conditions); and\n\u2022Securing required governmental permits.\n\u2022Our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our central reservation system to support additional franchised hotels in a timely, cost-effective manner; and\n\u2022The effectiveness and efficiency of our development organization.\nOur failure to compete successfully for properties to franchise, or to attract and maintain relationships with hotel owners and hotel investors, could adversely affect our ability to expand our system of hotels. An inability to implement our growth strategy could limit our ability to grow our revenue base and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf any franchise or hotel acquisitions fail to perform in accordance with our expectations or if we are unable to effectively integrate new franchisees or hotels into our operations, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nBased on our experience, newly acquired, developed or converted hotels typically begin with lower occupancy and room rates, thereby resulting in lower revenue. Any future expansion within our existing markets could adversely affect the financial performance of our hotels in those markets and, as a result, negatively impact our overall results of operations. Expansion into new markets may also present operating and marketing challenges that are different from those we currently encounter in our existing markets. Our inability to anticipate all of the changing demands that expanding operations will impose on our management and management information and reservation systems, or our failure to quickly adapt our systems and procedures to new markets, could result in lost revenue and increased expenses and otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our franchise agreements require that franchisees comply with certain brand standards that help maintain the quality and reputation of our brands. These include property improvement plans required at the beginning of the franchise relationship, as well as continuing obligations related to the appearance of the properties and the service levels provided by hotel employees. If our franchisees fail to make the investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties in accordance with our brand standards, guest preference for our brands could diminish and cause a negative impact on our overall results of operations. In addition, if our franchisees fail to observe these brand standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts. We may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated franchise relationships.\nIf our franchise or management contracts terminate or are not renewed, if new franchisees are unable to effectively integrate their hotels into our system, or if franchisees or owners are unprofitable or go out of business, our franchise or management fee revenue will decline.\nOur revenues and operating results are highly dependent upon the ability of our franchisees to generate revenue at their franchised properties. If the revenues of our franchisees decrease, or our franchisees close their hotels, our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur business model depends on our ability to establish and maintain long-term, positive relationships with our franchisees. Franchise agreements generally specify a fixed term and contain an early termination provision for the franchisee to terminate at specific intervals or for specific reasons with or without penalty by providing notice to us. There is no assurance these agreements will be renewed, or that they will not be terminated prior to the end of their respective terms. If we are unable to compete with other hotel companies on franchise and royalty fees or other resources, or our brand reputation declines, we may see an increase in non-renewal of our existing franchise agreements, or early terminations prior to the end of their respective terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace expired or terminated franchise agreements, or that the provisions of renegotiated or new agreements will be as favorable to us as the expired or terminated agreements. If we fail to maintain and renew existing franchise agreements, we may be unable to expand our franchise business, and our financial condition and revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, if a franchisee experiences financial or other difficulties, our franchisee may default on their obligations and be unable to satisfy their financial obligations to us, which would adversely affect our revenues and financial condition.\nIf owners of hotels that we franchise cannot repay or refinance mortgage loans secured by their properties, our revenues and profits could decrease and our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe owners of many of our franchised properties have pledged their hotels as collateral for mortgage loans they entered into when those properties were purchased or refinanced. If an owner cannot repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, the lender could declare a default, accelerate the related debt, and repossess the property. Such sales or repossessions could, in some cases, result in the termination of our franchise agreements and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may have disputes with the owners of the hotels that we franchise.\nThe nature of our responsibilities under our franchise agreements may, in some instances, be subject to interpretation and may give rise to disagreements. We seek to resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential franchisees, hotel owners and joint venture partners. However, we may not always be able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in franchisees or other hotel owners leaving our system of hotels, or in litigation, arbitration or other legal actions.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hospitality and leisure companies.\nThe lodging industry in general is comprised of numerous national, regional and local hotel companies and is highly competitive.\nWe compete with other hotel brands and management companies for hotels to add to our network, including through franchise and management agreements. Our competitors include management companies as well as large hotel chains that own and operate their hotels and franchise their brands. As a result, the terms of our prospective franchise and management agreements may not be as favorable as a hotel owner's current agreements. We may also be required to make investments in or guarantee the obligations of third parties or guarantee minimum income to third parties in connection with future franchise or management agreements in order to successfully compete for new franchisees.\nCompetition for occupancy at the hotels in our network is focused on three major categories of travelers: business travelers, convention and group business travelers and leisure travelers. All three categories are significant occupancy drivers for the hotels in our system and our marketing efforts are geared towards attracting their business. Competition in the industry is primarily based on service quality, range of services, brand name recognition, convenience of location, room rates, guest amenities and quality of accommodations. The hotels in our network compete against national economy, limited and full-service hotel brands and companies, various regional and local hotels in the midscale and economy hotel segments of the industry, and hotel alternatives, such as Airbnb. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, a larger network of locations and greater marketing and financial resources than we do. Competitors may offer significantly lower rates, greater convenience, services or amenities or superior facilities, which could attract customers away from hotels in our network. New hotels are being built in several markets where we operate, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in demographics and other changes in our markets may also adversely impact the convenience or desirability of our hotel locations. In order to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers, we and the owners of our franchised and managed hotels must be able to differentiate and enhance the quality, value and efficiency of our product and customer service, and we must make additional capital investments to modernize and update our hotels.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully in these areas, the hotels in our network could experience a decrease in occupancy, average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR), which could have a significant negative impact on the portion of our franchise revenues derived from hotel rooms revenues and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur new programs and new brands may not be successful.\nWe have made a significant investment in RevPak, a guest management system that allows hotel operators to increase their bookings by integrating customer relationship management software, sales force automation processes, translation services, a central guest reservation system, and digital and field marketing capabilities onto a single platform. Additionally, RevPak allows operators to measure results with reputation management, business intelligence, and web analytics capabilities. We believe this technology provides a measurable benefit to our company, our franchisees and other users of RevPak by helping increase hotel patronage and generate strong RevPAR growth. However, we cannot be certain this technology will provide all the benefits we anticipated, that it will be well received by all of our franchisees and hotel owners, or that we will be able to recover the costs we incurred in developing this system. We also cannot assure you that other programs and brands, such as Hotel RL, or any other new programs or brands we may launch in the future will be accepted by hotel owners, potential franchisees, or the traveling public or other customers. We also cannot be certain that we will recover the costs we incurred in developing or acquiring these programs or brands, or that the brands or any new programs will be successful.\nThe planned sale of joint venture and company owned hotels may not occur in the timeline expected and the company may not be able to replace the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA from this business in future periods.\nIn October 2017, our Board of Directors approved a process to market and sell 11 hotel ownership positions maintained in joint venture arrangements. Subsequently, in August 2018, we announced a process to market and sell three additional owned or leased hotels. In December 2018, we also listed a joint venture hotel for sale. This is consistent with our previously stated business strategy to move towards operating as primarily a franchise company. Between October 2017 and December 31, 2019, the company completed the sale of eleven hotel properties. See Note 16 Acquisitions and Dispositions within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. We expect that the completion of the remaining sales will allow the company to continue to reduce long-term debt and/or to increase cash reserves for future franchise agreement growth initiatives.\nIt is our intention, subject to market conditions, to sell all of our remaining hotel ownership positions in the next few years. Despite favorable market conditions at the time of the plan, we cannot be certain that the hotel sales will occur according to our preferred timing or at the market prices we anticipated. We cannot be certain that we will be able to replace the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results from these hotels or other hotel sales with franchise business growth in future periods, or that the profit margins of our franchise business will be as we expected.\nOur operating results are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.\nOur revenues and operating results may be impacted by and fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022Changes in the desirability of the geographic regions in which our hotels are located, or adverse changes in local economies where our hotels are concentrated;\n\u2022Insufficient available capital to us or our franchise hotel owners to fund renovations and investments needed to maintain our competitive position;\n\u2022New supply or oversupply of hotel rooms in markets in which we operate due to the cyclical over-building in the hotel industry;\n\u2022The attractiveness of our hotels to consumers and competition from other hotels and lodging alternatives such as Airbnb;\n\u2022The need to periodically repair and renovate the hotels in our hotel network, including the ongoing need to refresh hotels to meet current industry standards and guest expectations;\n\u2022The financial condition of third-party property owners and franchisees, which may impact their ability to fund renovations and meet their financial obligations to us as required under management and franchise agreements;\n\u2022The quality and performance of the employees of the hotels in our network;\n\u2022Changes in demand for business, convention, group and leisure traveler rooms and related lodging services, including reductions in business and federal, state and local government travel may result due to budgetary constraints or government shutdowns, increases in the use of video conferencing services, or general economic conditions;\n\u2022Decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconference networks;\n\u2022Extended periods of low occupancy demand, which may negatively impact our ability to increase rates;\n\u2022Changes in travel patterns, extreme weather conditions and cancellation of or changes in events scheduled to occur in our markets;\n\u2022The impact of internet intermediaries and competitor pricing;\n\u2022The ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers;\n\u2022Changes in guest expectations with respect to amenities at network hotels that require additional capital to meet;\n\u2022Improvements in technology that require capital investment by us or our franchise hotel owners in infrastructure to implement and maintain;\n\u2022The quality of services provided by franchisees;\n\u2022Transportation and fuel costs, the financial condition of the airline industry and the resulting impacts on travel, including possible cancellation or reduction of scheduled flights into our markets and reductions in our business with airlines crews, which regularly stay at our hotels in many markets;\n\u2022Increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, healthcare, working conditions, work permit requirements and other labor-related costs, energy prices, insurance and property taxes, as well as increases in construction or associated renovation costs;\n\u2022Existing and potential new regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, liquor service and health and safety of premises;\n\u2022Impact of war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, heightened security measures and other national, regional or international political and geopolitical conditions;\n\u2022Recent travel bans and other federal regulations that restrict entry into the United States could reduce overall tourist and business travel;\n\u2022Travelers' fears of exposure to contagious diseases or foodborne illness;\n\u2022Climate change or availability of natural resources;\n\u2022Restrictive changes in zoning and similar land use laws and regulations, or in health, safety and environmental laws, rules and regulations; and\n\u2022Enacted, pending and possible future requirements to make substantial modifications to our hotels to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or other governmental or regulatory requirements.\nAny of these factors could adversely impact our hotel brands, hotel room demand, and/or pricing, reduce occupancy, ADR and RevPAR and reduce franchise revenues, or give rise to government imposed fines or private litigants winning damage awards against us. These items could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe reported net losses from continuing operations from 2008 through 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2019, and, although we had a net profit in 2014, 2015, and 2018, there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future.\nDuring the years 2008 through 2013 and in 2016, 2017 and 2019, we reported net losses from continuing operations. Not only did these losses have a direct adverse effect on our financial condition, they also increased our costs of borrowing. Although we have shown a net profit during two of the last five years, the long prior history of net losses could impair our ability to raise capital needed for franchise expansion, hotel investments and other corporate purposes. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability in the future.\nGeneral economic conditions may negatively impact our results and liquidity.\nDuring economic downturns, discretionary travel decreases because of economic pressures, and this in turn hurts the hospitality industry and our company. High unemployment, lower family income, low corporate earnings, lower business investments and lower consumer and government spending all have the effect of reducing the demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services and put pressure on industry room rates and occupancy. A slowdown in economic conditions in 2020 could result in weak hospitality occupancy and rates and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Negative economic conditions could also negatively impact our ability to obtain future financing and our liquidity in general. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital and debt service for the foreseeable future, if our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or we do not meet our financial debt covenants, we could potentially face liquidity problems that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe hotel business is seasonal in nature, and we are likely to experience fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe hotel business is seasonal in nature, with the period from May through October generally accounting for the greatest portion of our annual company operated hotel revenues, and franchise royalties that are based on a percentage of hotel revenue. Therefore, our results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. The seasonal nature of our business increases our vulnerability to risks during this period, including labor force shortages, cash flow problems, economic downturns and poor weather conditions. The adverse impact to our revenues would likely be greater as a result of our seasonal business.\nOur expenses may remain constant or increase even if revenues decline.\nThe expenses of owning and operating a hotel are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in its revenues. Accordingly, a decrease in our revenues could result in a disproportionately higher decrease in our earnings because our expenses are unlikely to decrease proportionately. In addition, we continue to invest in sales and marketing, technology, franchising and personnel resources in an effort to position our company for future growth. These investments may not produce the returns we anticipate or the returns may take longer to achieve than expected.\nThe use of common stock to fund new acquisitions will dilute existing shareholders.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. in 2016, we issued 690,000 shares of common stock. Future acquisitions of other hotels or brands may also involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the businesses or assets acquired. These future issuances of our equity securities will dilute existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nJoint venture and other acquisition arrangements may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe have ownership interests of 55% in each of our joint ventures. We may in the future acquire interests in other properties through joint venture arrangements with other entities. In addition, we may enter into other non-property investment joint ventures through other divisions for marketing or other services. Partnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks. Some of these acquisitions may be financed in whole or in part by loans under which we are jointly and severally liable for the entire loan amount along with the other joint venture partners. The terms of these joint venture arrangements may be more favorable to the other party, or parties, than to us. Although we will actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships, joint ventures or similar structures, investing in a property through such arrangements may subject our investment to risks not present with a wholly owned property, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022The other owner(s) of the investment might become bankrupt;\n\u2022The other owner(s) may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;\n\u2022The other owner(s) may not have the economic ability to contribute operating funds, if needed, increasing our investment and funding to the joint venture(s);\n\u2022The other owner(s) may be unable to make required payments or meet guarantor obligations on loans under which we are jointly and severally liable;\n\u2022The other owner(s) may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, such as selling the property at a time when to do so would have adverse consequences to us;\n\u2022Actions by the other owner(s) might subject the property to liabilities in excess of those otherwise contemplated by us; and\n\u2022It may be difficult for us to sell our interest in the property at the time we deem a sale to be in our best interests.\nFailure of the joint venture or joint venture owners to comply with debt covenants could adversely affect our financial results or condition.\nDuring 2015 we entered into a joint venture related to our Washington DC property, in which we own an equity interest of 55%. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture borrowed $16.7 million, which was secured by the hotel property within the joint venture entity. The credit agreement for this loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nIn certain periods since 2015, our DC hotel has not generated enough revenues to comply with the debt covenants in place under its then current credit agreement. As a result, from time to time, we have been required to make additional cash contributions to this joint venture entity in the form of preferred capital. The preferred capital will be repaid to us only when the underlying hotel property is sold or when the joint venture is liquidated, plus a preferred return that ranges from 9%-11%. In addition, in December 2018, we agreed to amend the loan agreement for our DC property to cure certain covenant defaults by increasing our principal guarantee to $10.5 million.\nWhile we believe that our joint ventures have stabilized and that they will be able to continue to comply with their terms of their credit agreements, there can be no assurance that we won\u2019t be required to make additional capital contributions or increase guarantees in the future. Any failure of our joint ventures to comply with the terms of their loan covenants, or our inability to cure defaults by making additional capital contributions or increasing our principal guarantees, could result in a demand for immediate repayment of the loans, which could result in one or more of these hotels being foreclosed upon and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and limit our ability to obtain financing. For additional information, see Note 8 Debt and Line of Credit within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe have incurred debt financing and may incur increased indebtedness in connection with acquisitions, capital expenditures, other corporate purposes or growth of our system of hotels.\nNeither our Articles of Incorporation nor our Bylaws limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Subject to limitations in our debt instruments, we may incur additional debt in the future to finance hotel renovations, repairs and replacements, for general corporate purposes or for hotel acquisitions. If our leverage increases, the resulting debt service could adversely affect our operating cash flow. The degree to which we are leveraged could also increase our vulnerability to and reduce our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and lodging industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, and could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and to take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise. Increasing leverage could also place our company at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. Our indebtedness is, and will likely continue to be, secured by our existing assets. If we are not able to meet our debt service obligations, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure. Economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, which would increase debt service on our variable rate credit facilities and could reduce the amount of cash available for general corporate purposes. For additional information on our outstanding debt, see Note 8 Debt and Line of Credit within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have exposure to increases in interest rates under our DB Credit Facility. Outstanding amounts under the Line of Credit will bear interest at our election of 1-month, 2- month, 3-month, or 6-month LIBOR plus 3.00% with interest payable at the end of each elected 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, or 6-month elected term. Any significant increase in interest rates would have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and our future results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the DB Credit Facility uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform, and in July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulated LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, which is prior to the 2023 maturity date of our DB Credit Agreement. The DB Credit Agreement provides that if LIBOR is unavailable, the interest rate will be based upon a comparable or successor rate, which is approved by the administrative agent. At this time, the consequences of the phase out of LIBOR are unknown, however, the substitution of a comparable or successor rate could result in an increase in the cost of our variable interest rate(s) under the DB Credit Facility.\nOur existing leverage may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or take certain actions we believe are beneficial to our business operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt outstanding was $33.2 million, including $10.0 million outstanding under the Line of Credit through the DB Credit Agreement. We have no further borrowing capacity under the Line of Credit. Various limitations in our DB Credit Agreement may reduce our ability to incur additional debt, to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities. In particular, the DB Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions that may prevent us from engaging in certain beneficial transactions, such as limitations on incurring additional debt, entering into mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, making investments or dispositions, granting liens, declaring dividends or repurchasing any of our outstanding common stock. These restrictive covenants may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions, making capital expenditures or pursuing other business opportunities we believe are beneficial to the company and its shareholders. Failure to comply with the affirmative or restrictive covenants would be an event of default under our DB Credit Agreement. For additional information on our outstanding debt, see Note 8 Debt and Line of Credit within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur business requires capital for ongoing hotel maintenance, modernization and renovation, as well as for any asset or brand acquisitions or development projects we may want to undertake. If needed capital is not available, our ability to successfully compete with hotels in our scale categories may be adversely impacted.\nWe are committed to keeping our company owned properties well-maintained and attractive to our customers in order to maintain our competitiveness within the industry and keep our hotels properly positioned in their markets. We are also focused on working with our franchise hotel owners so that they maintain their properties to the same standards. This requires ongoing access to capital for both us and our franchisees for replacement of outdated furnishings as well as for facility repair, modernization and renovation. To the extent we or our franchisees cannot fund these expenditures from cash generated from operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. If these funds cannot be obtained, the expenditures have to be deferred to a later period. Without needed investments, we may need to cancel the agreement with the franchisee or move the hotel to a lower classification, both of which would likely have a negative impact on our franchise revenue stream.\nIn the recent past, our levels of capital expenditures for our company operated hotels have been lower than normal due to the marketing of our hotels for sale. Customers may not view our capital investments and improvements as significant enough to allow us to charge higher room rates, and this could negatively impact our hotel revenues and operating results. There are likely to be similar adverse effects if our franchisees are unable to make comparable investments in their properties. Without needed investments, we may have to move the hotel to a lower classification, which would likely have a negative impact on our hotel revenue stream.\nHotel maintenance, brand acquisitions, hotel acquisitions and new project development are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Availability of capital;\n\u2022Construction delays and cost overruns;\n\u2022Unavailability of rooms or meeting space for revenue generating activities during modernization and renovation projects;\n\u2022Numerous federal, state and local government regulations affecting the lodging industry, including building and zoning requirements and other required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022Uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun; and\n\u2022Potential environmental problems.\nWhether capital for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels will be available to us and our franchisees depends on a number of factors, including our cash reserves, profitability, degree of leverage, the value of assets, borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the capital markets. The condition of the capital markets and liquidity factors are outside our control, so there is no assurance that we or our franchisees will be able to obtain financing as needed.\nIf we need to raise capital through issuance of additional common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt, current shareholders may experience significant dilution. Moreover, there is no assurance that we could raise money through equity issuances.\nIf we seek to raise additional capital through financing, our leverage may increase. If our leverage increases, the resulting debt service could adversely affect our operating cash flow. Our continuing indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general economic and lodging industry conditions, including increases in interest rates.\nAny unanticipated delays or expenses incurred in connection with hotel maintenance and renovation, hotel acquisitions and new project development could impact expected revenues and availability of funds, negatively affect our reputation among hotel customers, owners and franchisees and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, including the carrying costs of our assets.\nWe are subject to various obligations and restrictions under the leases governing our leased properties. In addition, we may not be able to renew these leases on favorable terms or at all.\nFour of our company operated hotels, three of which are owned hotels and one of which is owned through a joint venture entity, and all of our corporate offices are subject to leases. In addition to the requirement to pay rent, the leases for these properties generally impose various maintenance and other obligations on us and may also require us to obtain the consent of the landlord before taking certain actions such as modifications to the properties. These lease provisions may limit our flexibility with the leased properties, delay modifications or other actions we may wish to take, or result in disputes with the landlords. In addition, the terms of the leases for three of our leased properties will expire in the period from 2021 through 2028. There can be no assurance that any of our landlords will be willing to extend these leases and, even if they are willing to extend, it is possible that the lease costs will increase, which would adversely impact the hotel operations and our expenses. If some of our office leases are not renewed for any reason, we could incur additional costs and expenses associated with negotiating a new lease agreement and moving our offices to a new location.\nThe results of some of our hotels are significantly impacted by group contract business and other large customers, and the loss of such customers for any reason could harm our operating results.\nGroup contract business and other large customers, or large events, can significantly impact the results of operations of some of the hotels in our network. These contracts and customers vary from hotel to hotel and change from time to time. Contracts with large customers such as airlines and railroads are typically for a limited period of time, after which they may be eligible for competitive bidding. The impact and timing of group business and large events are not always predictable and are often episodic in nature. The operating results for hotels in our network can fluctuate as a result of these factors, possibly in adverse ways, and these fluctuations can harm our overall operating results.\nThe increasing use of third-party travel websites by consumers may adversely affect our profitability.\nA significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries like Priceline, Expedia, or Travelocity, to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems. As internet bookings now represent the majority of hotel reservations in the industry, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us or our franchisees.\nMoreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to offer hotel rooms as a commodity, by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as \"three-star downtown hotel\") at the expense of brand identification. We believe that these internet intermediaries hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservation systems. Although most of the business for our hotels is expected to be derived from traditional channels, if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our central reservation system and other technologies for occupancy at hotels in our network and a lack of investment in upgrades or new technologies or any failures in the system could negatively affect our revenues and cash flows.\nThe hospitality industry requires the use of technology and systems for property management, procurement, reservations, operation of customer loyalty programs, distribution and other purposes. These technologies can be expected to change guests' expectations, and there is the risk that advanced new technologies will be introduced requiring further investment capital. We maintain a hotel reservation system that allows us to manage our hotel network's rooms inventory through various distribution channels, including our website, and execute rate management strategies. As part of our marketing strategy, we encourage guests to book on our website, which guarantees the lowest rate available compared to third-party travel websites.\nThe development and maintenance of our central reservation system and other technologies may require significant capital. There can be no assurances that, as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we will be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as our competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system. If our systems fail, whether as a result of a deliberate cyber-attack or an unintentional event that causes interruptions or delays in our ability to process reservations, our ability to conduct business and generate revenue will be negatively impacted. If our systems fail to achieve anticipated benefits, or if we fail to keep up with technological or competitive advances, our revenues and cash flows could suffer.\nOur central reservation system includes a third-party operated call center that enables guests to make reservations on a 24/7 basis. Poor performance by the third party provider, disputes with the third party provider, increased costs of the call center or our inability to renew or extend our agreement with the third party on favorable terms could adversely impact the hotel operations and our expenses as well as those of our franchised and managed hotels.\nFailure to maintain the security of internal or customer data could adversely affect us.\nOur operations require us to collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers, which are entered into, processed by, summarized by and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. Our franchise hotel owners also maintain similar personally identifiable information on systems that we do not control. The security of this data may potentially be breached due to a number of risks, including cyber-attack, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, franchisees or employees of third party vendors. Although we employ systems to protect data, no system is impenetrable. A theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data by us or our franchise hotel owners could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant remedial and other costs, fines and litigation.\nWe also rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques to reach guests and potential guests, including email marketing, telemarketing and postal mailings. Changes in laws and regulations regarding direct marketing and solicitation could adversely affect the effectiveness of these marketing techniques and could force us to make changes to our marketing strategies. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations regarding direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines or other restrictions on our business.\nWe collect and maintain information relating to our guests for various business purposes, including credit card information and information on guest preferences that we use to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotional purposes. A number of states have enacted data privacy laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, storage and protection of this type of sensitive personal information. These data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), continue to evolve, and compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to service our guests and market our products, properties and services. In addition, noncompliance with applicable privacy and security regulations, either by us or in some circumstances by third parties engaged by us or our franchise hotel owners, could expose us to substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, open us to the risk of private class-action litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nDisruption or malfunction in our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022Earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters;\n\u2022Power losses, computer system failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic losses of data and similar events;\n\u2022Third party provider disruptions in service; and\n\u2022Computer viruses, penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information, and other breaches of security.\nWe rely on our systems to perform functions critical to our ability to operate, including our central reservation system. Accordingly, an extended interruption in the systems' function could significantly curtail, directly and indirectly, our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We remediated these material weaknesses as of December 31, 2018, however if we fail to continue to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for each year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting, data systems, and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, a part of our growth strategy has been, and may continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our transactions, systems, and controls may become more difficult to manage. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially for acquisition targets that may not have been required to be in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act at the date of acquisition.\nDuring our evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, we identified material weaknesses in each of the following areas: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Monitoring and Financial Closing and Reporting.\nIn particular, controls related to the following were not designed to operate effectively:\nControl Environment\nWe did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with the appropriate knowledge, experience and/or training in application of GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\nWe did not maintain adequate qualified personnel with regard to certain significant complex transactions and technical accounting matters.\nRisk Assessment\nWe did not design and maintain internal controls that were effective in identifying, assessing and addressing risks that significantly impact the financial statements or the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting. We did not modify our controls to sufficiently address changes in risks of material misstatement as a result of changes in our operations, organizational structure and operating environment, specifically the expansion of activities related to recent acquisitions.\nMonitoring\nWe did not design and maintain effective monitoring of compliance with established accounting policies, procedures and controls. This weakness included the failure to design and operate effective procedures and controls whose purpose is to evaluate and monitor effectiveness of the individual control activities.\nFinancial Closing and Reporting\nWe did not design and maintain effective controls over the financial closing and reporting process with sufficient precision to mitigate a potential material misstatement.\nThese deficiencies were pervasive in nature and created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring 2018, management executed a remediation plan that included significant changes to our company's accounting and internal audit staffing. Remediation efforts included a formal risk assessment performed by internal audit and senior management and included an internal review of all internal control processes, which resulted in the identification of new internal controls to address design gaps, the re-design of certain existing controls, and the elimination of redundant or unnecessary controls. During 2018, we completed our remediation plan and successfully completed testing of the new control environment. As a result of our internal control testing, we concluded that the material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, there were no material weaknesses in internal controls as of December 31, 2019.\nAny material weaknesses in the future could cause harm to our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names.\nThe success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use our trademarks, increase brand awareness and further develop our brands. We have registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of various formulations of certain trademarks, including but not limited to the following: Red Lion, Hotel RL, Red Lion Inn & Suites, GuestHouse & Design, Settle Inn, Settle Inn & Suites, Signature & Design, Signature Inn, Knights Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, ABVI, Value Inn Worldwide, Vantage & Design, 3 Palms Hotels & Resorts & Design, America\u2019s Best Inns & Suites, Country Hearth Inn & Suites, Jameson Inn, Lexington, Canadas Best Value Inn & Design, CBVI, Cavanaughs and Cascadia Soapery, Hello Rewards, MAKE IT #WORTH IT, PROJECT WAKE UP CALL, RLHC and RLH.\nWe have also registered various formulations of the Red Lion trademark and others in several international jurisdictions including for example, Canada, Mexico, China, India, Australia, the European Union and a number of other countries in Asia. We cannot be assured that the measures we have taken to protect our trademarks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brands and their market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nDepartures of senior executives or other key employees could adversely affect our business.\nWe have seen significant turnover among our senior executives over the past five years. Our Chief Executive Officer resigned in November 2019 after five years at the company, and we are currently operating with an interim CEO while we search for a permanent replacement. Our current Chief Financial Officer was hired in January 2019 to replace her predecessor, who was hired in 2017 and announced his departure for personal reasons in October 2018. We hired a new Chief Operating Officer in June 2018, after the departure of our prior Chief Operating Officer and President of Global Development in May 2018, and our Chief Marketing Officer departed the Company in May 2019. Turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations, our relationships with our franchisees and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Further, we may incur significant expenses related to any executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. For example, in 2019 we recorded charges of $1.1 million related to executive and management transition, which included severance payments and other incremental expenses. Additional losses of senior team members could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We currently do not carry key person insurance on members of our senior management team.\nWe place substantial reliance on the lodging industry experience and the institutional knowledge of the members of our senior management team. We compete for qualified personnel with this experience against companies with greater financial resources than ours. In order to successfully recruit qualified employees, we will likely need to offer a combination of base salary and equity compensation. These future issuances of our equity securities will dilute existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Finding suitable replacements for senior management and other key employees can be difficult, and there can be no assurance we will continue to be successful in retaining or attracting qualified personnel in the future.\nTo be properly integrated into our company, new executives and employees must spend a significant amount of time learning our business model and management system, in addition to performing their regular duties. As a result, the integration of new personnel may result in some disruption to our ongoing operations, and the lack of continuity among our executive team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to impairment risk of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.\nFinancial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company's estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rates, and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short-term swing or a longer-term trend.\nMarket conditions in the future could adversely impact the fair value of one or both of our franchise or hotel reporting units, which could result in future impairments of their goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.\nThe assessment for possible impairment requires us to make judgments, including:\n\u2022Estimated future cash flows from the respective properties or business units, which are dependent upon internal forecasts;\n\u2022Estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business;\n\u2022The useful life over which our cash flows will occur;\n\u2022The determination of real estate and prevailing market values;\n\u2022Asset appraisals; and\n\u2022Current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous, comparable transactions, if available and appropriate.\nIn accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets, if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than net book value, the excess of net book value over estimated fair value of the assets is charged to current earnings. Changes in our estimates and assumptions as they relate to valuation of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets could affect, potentially materially, our financial condition or results of operations in the future. In 2019, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.4 million on our Hotel RL Washington DC joint venture property and impairment charges of $8.7 million on our Americas Best Value Inn and Knights Inn brand name intangible assets. In 2018 we recognized an impairment charge of $7.1 million on our Hotel RL Baltimore Inner Harbor joint venture property and an impairment charge of $3.5 million in our Guesthouse brand name intangible asset. For additional information, see Note 6 Goodwill and Intangible Assets within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nRisks associated with real estate ownership may adversely affect revenue or increase expenses.\nWe are subject to varying degrees of risk that generally arise from the ownership of real property. Revenue and cash flow from our hotels and other real estate may be adversely affected by, and costs may increase or market values may decrease as a result of changes beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;\n\u2022Changes in local real estate market conditions;\n\u2022Opening of other competing hotels in the region;\n\u2022Increases in interest rates and other changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing and capital leases;\n\u2022Increases in property and other taxes;\n\u2022The impact of present or future environmental legislation;\n\u2022Adverse changes in other governmental regulations, insurance and zoning laws; and\n\u2022Condemnation or taking of properties by governments or related entities.\nThese adverse conditions could potentially cause the terms of our borrowings to change unfavorably. Unfavorable changes in one or more of these conditions could also result in unanticipated expenses and higher operating costs, thereby reducing operating margins and otherwise adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe illiquidity of real estate investments and the lack of alternative uses of hotel properties could significantly limit our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotels and harm our financial condition.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we and the joint ventures in which we participate have a limited ability to promptly sell one or more hotels in response to changing economic, financial or investment conditions. The real estate market, including the market for hotels, is affected by general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible to convert hotels to alternative uses if they become unprofitable due to competition, age of improvements, decreased demand or other factors. The conversion of a hotel to an alternative use would also generally require substantial capital expenditures. This inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our hotels could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to service debt. In addition, sales of appreciated real property could generate material adverse tax consequences, which may make it disadvantageous for us to sell certain of our hotels.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nIf our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, the market price of our common shares could decrease. Because our common stock is relatively thinly traded, a sale of a large block of shares in the public market by any major shareholder would likely result in a significant decline in our stock price. Our stock price may also fluctuate materially based on announcements by large shareholders disclosing acquisitions or sales of our common stock, by such shareholders expressing their views with respect to actions they believe should be taken by our company, or by such shareholders taking actions designed to impact our corporate policy and strategy, such as attempting to obtain control of our board of directors or initiating or substantially assisting an unsolicited takeover attempt.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nLarge shareholders could seek to impact our corporate policy and strategy, and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders.\nAs of February 24, 2020, Coliseum Capital Management (Coliseum) held 17% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Coliseum, or one or more other large shareholders, may take actions designed to impact our corporate policy and strategy, and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders. Such actions could include, among other things, attempting to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest or initiating or substantially assisting an unsolicited takeover attempt. Responding to proxy contests and reacting to demands of activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations by diverting the attention of management and our employees. The uncertainty that can result from such actions may also lead to the loss of potential business opportunities, and harm our ability to attract new management, employees, franchisees, investors and other strategic partners\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nIn the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise or fall, some of which are unrelated to our operating performance, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Shortfalls in, or changes in our expectations about earnings, revenue, EBITDA or other key performance metrics;\n\u2022Changes in financial estimates, expectations of future financial performance or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022Changes in market valuations of companies in the hospitality industry;\n\u2022Changes in general economic conditions, and subsequent fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022Issuances of additional common stock or other securities;\n\u2022Announcements by our shareholders disclosing acquisitions or sales of our common stock or expressing their views with respect to actions they believe should be taken by our company;\n\u2022Hiring or departure of management\n\u2022Low daily trading volume of our stock; and\n\u2022Announcements by us or our competitors of, or speculation with respect to, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances.\nWe are not currently paying dividends and will likely not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur properties are subject to risks relating to natural disasters, terrorist activity and war, and any such event could materially adversely affect our operating results without adequate insurance coverage or preparedness.\nOur financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by acts of God, such as natural disasters, particularly in locations where our properties are located. Our properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability, public area liability, fire, boiler and machinery, extended coverage and rental loss insurance. However, certain types of catastrophic losses, such as those from earthquake, volcanic activity, flood, terrorism and environmental hazards, may exceed or not be covered by the insurance. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. Similarly, threatened or actual terrorist activity, war, epidemics, travel-related accidents, geopolitical uncertainty, international conflict and similar events that impact domestic and international travel have caused in the past, and may cause in the future, our results to differ materially from anticipated results. In addition, depending on the severity, a major incident or crisis may prevent operational continuity at hotels in our network and consequently impact the value of our brands or the reputation of our business.\nOur international operations are subject to political and monetary risks.\nWe currently have franchised hotels operating outside of the United States, including in Canada and South Korea. We may also in the future enter into new joint venture or franchise agreements with foreign hotel operators. International operations generally are subject to greater economic, geopolitical and other risks that are not present in United States operations. These risks include not only administrative and logistical difficulties in managing worldwide operations, but also risks of war, terrorism or civil unrest, political instability, exposure to local economic conditions, and adverse changes in the diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the United States.\nSales in international jurisdictions typically are made in local currencies, which exposes us to risks associated with currency fluctuations. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of translated U.S. dollars required for expenses outside the United States, or significantly decrease the U.S. dollars received from foreign currency revenues. We also face exposure to currency translation risk because we transact certain business outside of the United States in local currency, and then translate those results to U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates and the U.S. dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative impact on our financial results. To date we have not entered into foreign exchange hedging agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but even if we enter into these hedging agreements in the future, they may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely, and will involve risks of their own in the form of transaction costs and counterparty risk.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As a result, the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks and brands in foreign countries may not be sufficient to prevent the unauthorized use or the imitation of our trademarks by others, which could reduce the value of our brand and its goodwill, which could adversely affect our business. As we continue to expand internationally, the risks related to our international operations will become more significant.\nGovernment regulation could impact our franchise business.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC), various states and certain foreign jurisdictions, where we market franchises, regulate the sale of franchises. The FTC requires franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states in which our franchisees operate require registration or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states in which our franchisees operate have \"franchise relationship laws\" or \"business opportunity laws\" that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. While our business has not been materially affected by such regulation, there can be no assurance that this will continue or that future regulation or legislation will not have such an effect.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations.\nOur results of operations may be affected by the costs of complying with existing and future environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as an owner, operator or previous owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property we own or previously owned. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate a contaminated property properly, may prevent us from selling a property, using it as collateral for a loan, or affect the operation of businesses at the property. The costs of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTwo of our previously owned properties located in Port Angeles, WA and Salt Lake City, UT, had known contamination on the property in excess of applicable cleanup levels. At Port Angeles, a Phase II environmental site assessment conducted in 2013 revealed that fill material from an unknown source was placed at the property prior to construction of the existing buildings. This fill material contained petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene and PAHs at concentrations greater than applicable cleanup levels. At the time of the sale of our Port Angeles property in July 2018, no exposure pathways existed from the property due to caps on the soil consisting of asphalt or structures. There can be no assurance that remediation will not be required in the future, however, and as a prior owner of the Port Angeles property we may retain some liability for the costs of remediation. Our Salt Lake City hotel property, which we sold in December 2019, was exposed to a toxic substance spill that migrated from a neighboring property. We completed a site cleanup on the property and believe the contamination has been remediated. However, there can be no assurance that additional cleanup will not be required in the future, and as a prior owner of the Salt Lake City property we may retain some liability for the costs of remediation.\nWe currently own a small parcel of land adjacent to the hotel in Salt Lake City that we sold in December 2019. It was discovered in 2019 that the parcel had contamination resulting from prior uses of the land. The contamination has been reported to the State of Utah - Department of Environmental Quality. Investigations as to the scope and mitigation are ongoing.\nWe face risks relating to litigation.\nAt any given time, we are subject to claims and actions incidental to the operation of our business. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If a plaintiff were successful in a claim against us, we could be faced with the payment of a material sum of money, and we may not be insured for such a loss. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our financial condition may be adversely impacted by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees or customers. In recent years, a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, accessibility and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits in the future may be instituted against us, and we may incur material damages and expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in recent years there has been increasing activity by patent holding companies (so-called patent \"trolls\") that do not use technology but whose sole business is to enforce patents for monetary gain against companies in a wide variety of businesses and industries. These efforts typically involve proposing licenses in exchange for a substantial sum of money and may also include the threat or actual initiation of litigation for that purpose. Any such litigation can be quite costly to defend, even if infringement is unsubstantiated or speculative. We have been threatened with one such claim and two claims have actually been filed against us. Each claim is related to separate technology, but we believe that each such technology is non-proprietary. Both filed claims have been resolved. If we are ultimately found to have violated a patent, our operations could be negatively impacted and/or we might be subject to substantial financial penalties, licensing fees and attorneys' fees. It is not possible to predict the potential impact on our business and operations of any future claims of this type that may be asserted against us.\nWashington law contains provisions that could deter takeover attempts.\nOur company is incorporated in the State of Washington and subject to Washington state law. The Washington State Anti\u00adtakeover Act could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change-in-control events affecting us. For example, one statutory provision prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any significant business transaction, such as a merger, with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our common stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an \"acquiring person\") for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder becomes an acquiring person.", "PERMNO": 85939, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "RLH"}
