Risk Factors\nThe summary below provides an overview of many of the risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. As a result, the below summary risks do not contain all of the information that may be important to you. Additional risks, beyond those summarized below or discussed in this section, may also materially and adversely impact our business, financial conditions and results of operation, and you should read the summary risks together with the more detailed discussion of risks set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in this section \"Risk Factors,\" alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Consistent with the foregoing, the risks we face include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u2022\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to increasing credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nChanges in market interest rates or capital markets could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\n\u2022\nUnpredictable future developments related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger\n\u2022\nThe value of the per share merger consideration to be received by Spirit shareholders is

discourage other companies from pursuing a business combination with Spirit that might result in greater value to Spirit shareholders.\n\u2022\nShares of Simmons common have different rights from the shares of Spirit common stock.\n\u2022\nThe Proposed Merger is expected to, but may not, qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.\n\u2022\nLitigation against Spirit or Simmons could result in significant costs, distraction, and/or a delay.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the Proposed Merger.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company\u2019s Business Following the Proposed Merger\n\u2022\nThe market price of the common stock of the combined company after the Proposed Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of Simmons or Spirit common stock.\n\u2022\nSales of Simmons common stock in the open market could depress Simmons\u2019 stock price.\n\u2022\nCombining the two companies may be difficult, costly or time consuming.\n\u2022\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses related to the Proposed Merger.\n\u2022\nHolders of Spirit common stock will have a reduced ownership after the Proposed Merger.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\u2022\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas, which imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting its Texas markets.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy.\n\u2022\nOur SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans.\n\u2022\nWe face specific risks associated with foreign nationals.\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop, retain and recruit bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses to which we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan.\n\u2022\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is insufficient, our earnings may be affected.\n\u2022\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\n\u2022\nA portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of 1-4 single family residential real estate loans, and negative changes in the economy affecting real estate could impair the value of collateral.\n\u2022\nOur commercial real estate and construction, land and development loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that could be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\n\u2022\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect our business.\n\u2022\nOur primary markets are susceptible to severe weather events that could

interest income and otherwise negatively impact us.\n\u2022\nUncertainty related to the LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe could recognize losses on investment securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\n\u2022\nWe face strong competition from financial services

require significant resources and attention.\n\u2022\nWe could be subject to harm due to acts on the part of our loan customers, employees or vendors.\n\u2022\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Regulation\n\u2022\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations could adversely affect us.\n\u2022\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase impact our business.\n\u2022\nAs a regulated entity, we and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our and the Bank\u2019s operations and potential growth.\n\u2022\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions could adversely affect us.\n\u2022\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to numerous lending laws designed to protect consumers and failure to comply with

fluctuate significantly.\n\u2022\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\n\u2022\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\u2022\nOur shareholders may be deemed to be in control of us, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences.\n\u2022\nOur directors and executive officers could have the ability to influence shareholder actions in a manner that may be adverse to your personal investment objectives.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and/or financial condition. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information in this report, or in other reports we file with the SEC, constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, real estate, commodities and other markets and could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a COVID-19 outbreak was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Since that time, the coronavirus has spread throughout the United States, including in the regions and communities in which the Company operates. In response, many state and local governments, including the State of Texas, instituted various emergency restrictions that substantially limited the operation of non-essential businesses and the activities of individuals. Although many of these restrictions have eased or been lifted, these restrictions have resulted in significant adverse effects on our customers and business partners, particularly those in the retail, hospitality and food and beverage industries, among many others, including a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide, and in the regions and communities in which we operate. These measures may be implemented again in the event of another COVID-19 outbreak or any current or future variant thereof and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition, as well as the business, operations and financial conditions of our customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe ultimate effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, including as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns, changes in consumer behavior, business closures, deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the Company (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented), declines in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, branch or office closures and business interruptions.\nWe are subject to increasing credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. We are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with loans and borrowers. As the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, and in our market areas specifically, experience material disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our borrowers have had, and may have again, difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 could preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. We have been actively working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although loans on deferral related to the COVID-19 pandemic at December 31, 2021 were only $13.9 million, we cannot predict whether any such future loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in market interest rates or capital markets, including volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of Federal Reserve actions. Market interest rates declined significantly in 2020 and have remained at such levels over the past year. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income and margins and our profitability.\nGiven our business mix, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the financial markets. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than increases in the interest we receive on loans and investments, net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be affected. Earnings could also be affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19, and any current or future variant thereof, has also led to disruption and volatility in financial markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access financial markets. This market volatility could result in a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, which could result in goodwill impairment charges.\nUnpredictable future developments related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our stock price, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Any future development is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios could be materially adversely affected and many of the risks described herein will be heightened.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger\nBecause the market price of Simmons common stock and the amount of fully diluted shares of Spirit common stock outstanding will both fluctuate, the value of the per share merger consideration to be received by Spirit shareholders is uncertain.\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement with Simmons First National Corporation, pursuant to and subject to the terms of which we will merge with and into Simmons, with Simmons as the surviving corporation. Based on the assumptions set forth herein, upon completion of the Proposed Merger, each share of outstanding Spirit common stock (except for shares of Spirit common stock held directly or indirectly by Spirit or Simmons and any dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration, with cash paid in lieu of any resulting fractional shares. Any change in the market price of Simmons common stock prior to the completion of the Proposed Merger will affect the market value of the per share merger consideration that Spirit shareholders will receive upon completion of the Proposed Merger. The value of the per share merger consideration could also change if the amount of fully diluted shares of Spirit common stock outstanding changes after the date hereof. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the respective businesses, operations and prospects of Simmons or Spirit, and regulatory considerations, among other things. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Simmons and Spirit.\nThere will be no adjustment to the per share merger consideration based upon changes in the market price of Simmons common stock or Spirit common stock prior to the time the Proposed Merger is completed, and the merger agreement cannot be terminated due to a change in the price of Simmons common stock.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the Proposed Merger and the bank merger, may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities. In determining whether to grant these approvals, the applicable regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the competitive impact of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; financial, managerial and other supervisory considerations, including the future prospects, of each party; potential effects of the Proposed Merger on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the record of the insured depository institution subsidiaries under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the Community Reinvestment Act, including the subsidiaries\u2019 overall compliance records and recent fair lending examinations; effectiveness of the parties in combatting money laundering activities; the extent to which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; and whether Simmons controls or would after consummation of the Proposed Merger control deposits in excess of certain limits. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining pending regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Proposed Merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the Proposed Merger. While some regulatory approvals have been received, pending regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may contain conditions on the completion of the Proposed Merger that are not anticipated or cannot be met. Furthermore, such conditions or changes may constitute a burdensome condition that may allow Simmons to terminate the merger agreement and Simmons may exercise its right to terminate the merger agreement. If the consummation of the Proposed Merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each party may also be adversely affected.\nFailure of the Proposed Merger to be completed, the termination of the merger agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the Proposed Merger could negatively impact Simmons and Spirit.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Proposed Merger. These conditions to the consummation of the Proposed Merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Proposed Merger may not be completed. In addition, if the merger is not completed by November 30, 2022, either Simmons or Spirit may choose to terminate the merger agreement at any time after such date if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is not caused by any breach of the merger agreement by the party electing to terminate the merger agreement, before or after Spirit shareholder approval of the Proposed Merger.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not consummated, the ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations of each party may be adversely affected and the market price of Simmons common stock and Spirit common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Proposed Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Proposed Merger is delayed, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each party may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, each party has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing our proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC and other regulatory agencies in connection with the Proposed Merger. If the Proposed Merger is not completed, the parties would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the Proposed Merger, including the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the merger agreement on the ability to make significant changes to each party\u2019s ongoing business during the pendency of the Proposed Merger, could have an adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, Simmons\u2019 or Spirit\u2019s business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Proposed Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Proposed Merger, and the market price of Simmons\u2019 or Spirit\u2019s common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Proposed Merger will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated and a party\u2019s board of directors seeks another Proposed Merger or business combination, such party\u2019s shareholders cannot be certain that such party will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Proposed Merger.\nSome of the conditions to the Proposed Merger may be waived by Simmons or Spirit without resoliciting Spirit shareholder approval of the merger agreement.\nSome of the conditions to the Proposed Merger set forth in the merger agreement may be waived by Spirit or Simmons, subject to the agreement of the other party in specific cases. If any such conditions are waived, Spirit and Simmons will evaluate whether an amendment of our proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies is warranted. In the event that the Spirit board of directors determines that resolicitation of Spirit shareholders is not warranted, Simmons and Spirit will have the discretion to complete the Proposed Merger without seeking further Spirit shareholder approval.\nSimmons and Spirit will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Proposed Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Proposed Merger on employees, customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the parties to the Proposed Merger. These uncertainties may impair Simmons\u2019 or Spirit\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and customers (including depositors and borrowers) pending the consummation of the Proposed Merger, as such personnel and customers may experience uncertainty about their future roles and relationships following the consummation of the Proposed Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers (including depositors and borrowers), suppliers, vendors and others who deal with Simmons and/or Spirit to seek to change existing business relationships with Simmons and/or Spirit or fail to extend an existing relationship with Simmons and/or Spirit. In addition, competitors may target each party\u2019s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Proposed Merger.\nThe pursuit of the Proposed Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on each company\u2019s management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have an adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the merger agreement restricts each party from taking certain actions without the other party\u2019s consent while the Proposed Merger is pending. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpirit\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Proposed Merger that may be different from the interests of the Spirit shareholders.\nSpirit\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Proposed Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Spirit shareholders generally. The Spirit board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommending to Spirit shareholders that they vote to approve the Proposed Merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from pursuing, announcing or submitting a business combination proposal to Spirit that might result in greater value to Spirit shareholders.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from pursuing, announcing or submitting a business combination proposal to Spirit that might result in greater value to the Spirit shareholders than the Proposed Merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on Spirit from soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions. Furthermore, if the merger agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, Spirit may be required to pay Simmons a termination fee equal to $22,750,000. Spirit also has an unqualified obligation to submit its merger-related proposals to a vote by its shareholders, including if Spirit receives an unsolicited proposal that the Spirit board of directors has determined in good faith is superior to the Proposed Merger.\nIn connection with entering into the merger agreement, each member of the Spirit board of directors and Spirit\u2019s named executive officers, in their capacities as individuals, have separately entered into a Spirit voting agreement pursuant to which they agreed to vote their beneficially owned shares of Spirit common stock in favor of the merger proposal and certain related matters and against alternative transactions. Shares constituting approximately 24.7% of the Spirit common stock entitled to vote at the Spirit special meeting are subject to Spirit voting agreements.\nThe shares of Simmons common stock to be received by holders of Spirit common stock as a result of the Proposed Merger will have different rights from the shares of Spirit common stock.\nThe rights of Spirit shareholders are currently governed by the second amended and restated certificate of formation of Spirit, which we refer to as the Spirit charter, and the second amended and restated bylaws of Spirit, as amended, which we refer to as the Spirit bylaws. Upon completion of the Proposed Merger, the rights of former holders of Spirit common stock will be governed by the Simmons charter and the Simmons bylaws. Simmons is organized under Arkansas law, while Spirit is organized under Texas law. The rights associated with Spirit common stock are different from the rights associated with Simmons common stock.\nThe Proposed Merger is expected to, but may not, qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.\nThe parties expect the Proposed Merger to be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the obligations of Simmons and Spirit to complete the Proposed Merger are conditioned upon the receipt of U.S. federal income tax opinion to that effect from Covington & Burling LLP, which we refer to as Covington. This tax opinion represents the legal judgment of counsel rendering the opinion and is not binding on the United States Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, or the courts. The expectation that the Proposed Merger will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code reflects assumptions and takes into account the relevant information available to Simmons and Spirit at the time. However, this information is not a fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of future results. Furthermore, such expectation constitutes a forward-looking statement. For information on forward-looking statements, see the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIf the Proposed Merger does not qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, then the exchange of Spirit common stock for Simmons common stock pursuant to the Proposed Merger may be treated as a taxable transaction to holders of Spirit common stock. Consequently, a holder of Spirit common stock may be required to recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the fair market value of Simmons common stock received by the Spirit shareholder in the Proposed Merger and the amount of cash, if any, received by the Spirit shareholder, and (2) the Spirit shareholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the shares of Spirit common stock exchanged therefor. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you.\nThe opinion of Stephens Inc. delivered to the Spirit board of directors prior to the signing of the merger agreement will not reflect changes in circumstances after the date of the opinion.\nThe Spirit board of directors received a fairness opinion from Stephens Inc., Spirit\u2019s financial advisor, dated November 18, 2021. Such opinion has not been updated as of the date of our proxy statement/prospectus and will not be updated at, or prior to, the time of the completion of the Proposed Merger. Changes in the operations and prospects of Simmons or Spirit, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Simmons and Spirit may alter the value of Simmons or Spirit or the prices of shares of Simmons common stock or Spirit common stock by the time the Proposed Merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as of the time the Proposed Merger is completed or as of any other date than the date of the opinion.\nLitigation against Spirit or Simmons, or the members of the Spirit or Simmons board of directors, could result in significant costs, management distraction, and/or a delay of or injunction against the Proposed Merger.\nWhile Simmons and Spirit believe that any claims that may be asserted by purported shareholder plaintiffs related to the Proposed Merger would be without merit, the results of any such potential legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the Proposed Merger from being competed in a timely manner. The existence of litigation related to the Proposed Merger could affect the likelihood of obtaining the required approval from Spirit shareholders. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert Simmons and Spirit management\u2019s attention away from their regular business and, any lawsuit adversely resolved against Spirit, Simmons or members of the Spirit or Simmons board of directors, could have an adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the actions remain unresolved, they could prevent or delay the completion of the Proposed Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Proposed Merger is the absence of any law or order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by any court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting, restricting or making illegal consummation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the Proposed Merger). Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any lawsuit that is filed or any regulatory proceeding and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief or a regulatory authority issues an order or other directive prohibiting, restricting or making illegal consummation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including the Proposed Merger), then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Proposed Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the Proposed Merger.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of Simmons and Spirit. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any current or future variant of COVID-19, cause continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of Simmons or Spirit, or the business operations of Simmons or Spirit are disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the Proposed Merger and integrate the businesses of Simmons and Spirit may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, and regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements on Simmons or Spirit that must be satisfied prior to completion of the Proposed Merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the Proposed Merger.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company\u2019s Business Following the Proposed Merger\nThe market price of the common stock of the combined company after the Proposed Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the shares of Simmons or Spirit common stock.\nUpon the completion of the Proposed Merger, Simmons shareholders and Spirit shareholders will become shareholders of the combined company. Simmons\u2019 business differs from that of Spirit, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock\nmay be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Simmons and Spirit.\nSales of substantial amounts of Simmons common stock in the open market by former Spirit shareholders could depress Simmons\u2019 stock price.\nShares of Simmons common stock that are issued to Spirit shareholders in the Proposed Merger will be freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act. Simmons currently expects to issue 18,325,000 shares of Simmons common stock in connection with the Proposed Merger based on the assumptions described herein. If the Proposed Merger is completed and if Spirit\u2019s former shareholders sell substantial amounts of Simmons common stock in the public market following completion of the Proposed Merger, the market price of Simmons common stock may decrease. These sales might also make it more difficult for Simmons to sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Proposed Merger may not be realized.\nThe success of the Proposed Merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company\u2019s ability to combine the businesses of Simmons and Spirit. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve this objective, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nSimmons and Spirit have operated and, until the completion of the Proposed Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Proposed Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the successful combination of the businesses of Simmons and Spirit. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, after the completion of the Proposed Merger, Simmons expects to integrate Spirit\u2019s business into its own. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Proposed Merger. The loss of key employees could have an adverse effect on the companies\u2019 financial results and the value of their common stock. If Simmons experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause Simmons or Spirit to lose current customers or cause current customers to remove their accounts from Simmons or Spirit and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Simmons or Spirit during this transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the Proposed Merger.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses related to the Proposed Merger.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with consummation of the Proposed Merger and combining the business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the two companies. Although Simmons and Spirit have assumed that a certain level of transaction and combination expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of their combination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Due to these factors, the transaction and combination expenses associated with the Proposed Merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the combination of the businesses following the consummation of the Proposed Merger. As a result of these expenses, both Simmons and Spirit expect to take charges against their earnings before and after the completion of the Proposed Merger. The charges taken in connection with the Proposed Merger are expected to be significant, although the aggregate amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nHolders of Simmons and Spirit common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Proposed Merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nHolders of Simmons and Spirit common stock currently have the right to vote for the election of the directors and on other matters affecting Simmons and Spirit, respectively. Upon the completion of the Proposed Merger, each Spirit shareholder who receives shares of Simmons common stock will become a shareholder of Simmons with a\npercentage ownership of Simmons common stock that is smaller than such shareholder\u2019s percentage ownership of Spirit common stock. Following completion of the Proposed Merger, it is currently expected that former holders of Spirit common stock as a group will own approximately 14.0% of the combined company\u2019s common stock and existing Simmons common shareholders as a group will own approximately 86.0% of the combined company\u2019s common stock. As a result, Spirit shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of Spirit, and existing Simmons shareholders may have less influence than they now have on the management and policies of Simmons.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas, specifically in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Bryan/College Station, San Antonio-New Braunfels, Corpus Christi, Tyler and Austin metropolitan areas and North Central Texas, which imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting its Texas markets, including any downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in our Texas markets. Likewise, as of such date, the substantial majority of our secured loans were secured by collateral located in Texas. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in Texas significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, and any adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio.\nThe economies in our markets are also highly dependent on the energy sector as well as the technology and real estate sectors. In particular, a decline in or volatility of the prices of crude oil or natural gas could adversely affect many of our customers. Any downturn or adverse development in our Texas markets, including as a result of a downturn in the energy, technology or real estate sectors, could result in increases in loan delinquencies, increases in non-performing assets and foreclosures, decreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position, and decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the inflationary outlook in the United States remains uncertain. The consumer price index increased 7 percent year-over-year in December 2021. The risks to our business from inflation depends on the durability of the current inflationary pressures in our markets. Transitory increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material impact on our business or earnings. However, more persistent inflation could lead to tighter-than-expected monetary policy which could, in turn, increase the borrowings costs of our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations. High interest rates may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nOur strategy focuses on organic growth and acquisitions. We may not be able to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions. We face significant competition in pursuing acquisition targets from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources than we do. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on our available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire or successfully eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations in a timely manner may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, acquisitions in Texas typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and earnings per share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we currently maintain or may acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nSBA lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government and our status as a participant in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans and selling the guaranteed portion thereof.\nWe have been approved by the SBA to participate in the SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders Program. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSBA lending programs typically guarantee 75.0% of the principal on an underlying loan. We generally sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in both premium income for us at the time of sale, and created a stream of future servicing income. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market for these loans will continue to exist or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on the non-guaranteed portion of a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. Furthermore, if our employees do not follow the SBA guidelines in originating loans and if our loan review and audit programs fail to identify and rectify such failures, the SBA may reduce or, in some cases, refuse to honor its guarantee obligations and we may incur losses as a result.\nThe laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. In addition, the aggregate amount of SBA 7(a) and 504 loan guarantees by the SBA must be approved each fiscal year by the federal government. We cannot predict the effects of these changes or decisions on our business and profitability. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of SBA loan guarantees, such reduction could adversely impact our SBA lending program, including making and selling the guaranteed portion of fewer SBA 7(a) and 504 loans. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could, among other things, impede our ability to originate SBA or U.S. Department of Agriculture loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoans to and deposits from foreign nationals are an important part of our business and we face specific risks associated with foreign nationals.\nAs of December 31, 2021, loans to foreign nationals of $143.3 million comprised 6.2% of our loan portfolio and deposits from foreign nationals of $30.8 million comprised 1.1% of our total deposits. We define foreign nationals as those who derive more than 50.0% of their personal income from non-U.S. sources. We intend to grow this segment of its loan and deposit portfolio in the future. These borrowers typically lack a U.S. credit history and have a potential to leave the United States without fulfilling their mortgage obligation and leaving us with little\nrecourse to them personally. Additionally, transactions with foreign nationals place additional pressure on our policies, procedures and systems for complying with the Bank Secrecy Act and other AML statutes and regulations.\nOur ability to develop bankers, retain bankers and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of our bankers, many of whom we develop internally. If we lose the services of any of our bankers, including successful bankers employed by financial institutions that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, or fail to successfully recruit bankers or develop bankers internally, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy, retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether a new banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to develop, attract or retain successful bankers, or if our bankers fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses to which we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small- to medium-sized businesses, which we define as commercial borrowing relationships with customers with revenues of $3.0 million to $30.0 million. Small- to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact our primary service areas specifically or Texas generally and small- to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings may be affected.\nWe establish our allowance for loan and lease losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of our loan portfolio and market environment. Although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future losses. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates.\nWe may be required to take additional provisions for loan and lease losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan and lease losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by our banking regulators, which would result in a decrease in our net income and our capital balance. These adjustments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the FASB decided to review how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued the final current expected credit loss standard (\u201cCECL\u201d) in June 2016. The current allowance model will be replaced by the new CECL model that will become effective for us, as an emerging growth company, for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Under the new CECL model, financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters, and there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans secured by receivables, promissory notes, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $464.7 million, or 20.0% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of commercial loans to businesses. These commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate exposing us to increased credit risk. A portion of our commercial loans are secured by promissory notes that evidence loans made by us to borrowers that in turn make loans to others that are secured by real estate. Accordingly, significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of 1-4 single family residential real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $362.2 million, or 15.6% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of loans with 1-4 single family residential real estate as a primary component of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our primary markets could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate and construction, land and development loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that could be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $1.03 billion, or 44.4% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans) and $401 million, or 17.3% of our loans held for investment, were comprised of construction, land and development loans. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Additionally, nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which would reduce our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstruction, land and development loans also involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project, and this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary markets are susceptible to severe weather events that could negatively impact the economies of our markets, our operations or our customers, any of which impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary markets are susceptible to tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms and other natural disasters and severe weather conditions. Future severe weather events in our markets could potentially result in extensive and costly property damage to businesses and residences, force the relocation of residents and significantly disrupt economic activity in our markets. If the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of a catastrophic event, demand for loans and our other products and services could decline. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on our loan portfolios may increase substantially after events such as hurricanes, as uninsured property losses, interruptions of our customers\u2019 operations or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be materially and adversely affected by a catastrophic event. A severe weather event, therefore, could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and business, as well as potentially increase our exposure to credit and liquidity risks.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure data processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nWe may be subject to additional credit risk with respect to loans that we make to other lenders.\nAs a part of our commercial lending activities, we may make loans to customers that, in turn, make commercial and residential real estate loans to other borrowers. When we make a loan of this nature, we take as collateral the promissory notes issued by the end borrowers to our customer, which are themselves secured by the underlying real estate. Because we are not lending directly to the end borrower, and because our collateral is a promissory note rather than the underlying real estate, we may be subject to risks that are different from those we are exposed to when it makes a loan directly that is secured by commercial or residential real estate. Because the ability of the end borrower to repay its loan from our customer could affect the ability of our customer to repay its loan from us, our inability to exercise control over the relationship with the end borrower and the collateral, except under limited circumstances, could expose us to credit losses that adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers, which may increase our risk of loss.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, and as of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 20 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to $227.1 million, or 9.8% of loans held for investment, and $392.0 million, or 16.9% of loans held for investment, respectively. In the event that one or more of these borrowers is not able to make payments of interest and principal in respect of such loans, the potential loss to us is more likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. Our most important source of funds is deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing its net interest income and net income.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in our primary markets, or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn inability to raise additional capital in the future or otherwise could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2021, meaning that we estimate our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and our overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nUncertainty related to the LIBOR determination process and LIBOR discontinuance may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31, 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the alternative rate for use in derivatives and other financial contracts currently being indexed to LIBOR. SOFR is a daily index of the interest rate banks and hedge funds pay to borrow money overnight, secured by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool, and the future of LIBOR is still uncertain.\nIn October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny. In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nWe could recognize losses on investment securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant majority of our total assets in loans, we invest a percentage of our total assets (13.0% as of December 31, 2021) in investment securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. Factors beyond our control can significantly and adversely influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio. Such factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may incur realized or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our primary market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than we can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have production offices or otherwise solicit loan and deposit products in our market areas. Furthermore, our legal lending limit is significantly less than the limits for many of our competitors, and this may hinder our ability to establish relationships with larger businesses in our primary service area. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion regarding us or failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect our business and prevent us from growing our business.\nAs a community bank, our reputation within the communities we serve is critical to our success. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action or delay in acting as we seek to implement our growth strategy.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. In addition, new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to our failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise. Moreover, even if our management concludes that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may not conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies\nthat we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the FDIC for compliance with the requirement of FDICIA. Any such deficiencies may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or FDICIA, and we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nWe expect to incur significant incremental costs related to operating as a public company, particularly when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and NASDAQ, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.\nWe expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent, negligent or other acts on the part of our loan customers, employees or vendors.\nEmployee errors or employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding from us unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or employee or customer misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nIn addition, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including representations and warranties, financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information may not be detected prior to funding a loan or during our ongoing monitoring of outstanding loans. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nOur future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our product and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require it to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nIn addition, changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate. Many of our larger competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent it is unable to provide such products and services.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive certain third-party services including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond our control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs and the impacts of epidemics or pandemics, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs. Tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt\u037e which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as coronavirus or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact our and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers\u2019 products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Regulation\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the banking system in the United States. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things.\nCertain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, including laws applicable to the financial industry and federal and state taxation, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business, financial condition and results of operations, may not occur on the timeframe that is proposed, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nAs a regulated entity, we and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our and the Bank\u2019s operations and potential growth.\nWe and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nMany factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments, impairment losses on securities and other factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios. Our failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends to the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and on our and the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Under regulatory rules, if we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and our ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect it.\nTexas and federal bank regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a regulatory agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we, the Bank or our respective management, were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital levels, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, the Bank or our respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance, with the result that the Bank would be closed. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nGenerally, we must receive federal and state regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell branches or other business lines as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, and associated enforcement actions.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cJustice Department\u201d), the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by OFAC.\nIf our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and on expansion opportunities, including acquisitions.\nWe are subject to numerous lending laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material sanctions and penalties and restrictions on our expansion opportunities.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the FDIC, the Justice Department and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Accordingly, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nSuch a capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited and we may be required to raise capital or borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. Any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection may be difficult and expensive and may adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nAlthough we cannot determine the effects of such policies on it at this time, such policies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nWe completed the initial public offering of our common stock and the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on NASDAQ in May 2018. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained. If an active trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling your shares of our common stock at an attractive price, or at all. Consequently, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above an attractive price at the time that you would like to sell.\nThe market price of our common stock could be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for banks and financial services companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, its stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, either absolutely or relative to our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing additional shares of our common stock.\nWe may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise materially adversely affect our shareholders, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of formation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of our shareholders.\nWe are dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted, which could impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nOur primary asset is the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations, including debt obligations. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations or pay dividends.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) and we have taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur shareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are subject to the BHC Act, and federal and state banking regulation, that will impact the rights and obligations of owners of our common stock. Any bank holding company or foreign bank that is subject to the BHC Act may need approval to acquire or retain 5.0% or more of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, and any holder (or group of holders deemed to be acting in concert) may need regulatory approval to acquire or retain 10.0% or more of the shares of our common stock. A holder or group of holders may also be deemed to control us if they own 25.0% or more of its total equity. Under certain limited circumstances, a holder or group of holders acting in concert may exceed the 25.0% threshold and not be deemed to control us until they own 33.3% or more of our total equity. The amount of total equity owned by a holder or group of holders acting in concert is calculated by aggregating all shares held by the holder or group, whether as a combination of voting or non-voting shares or through other positions treated as equity for regulatory or accounting purposes and meeting certain other conditions. Holders deemed to be in \u201ccontrol\u201d of us will be subject to certain reporting and other obligations with the Federal Reserve. Our shareholders should consult their own counsel with regard to regulatory implications.\nOur directors and executive officers could have the ability to influence shareholder actions in a manner that may be adverse to your personal investment objectives.\nDue to the significant ownership interests of our directors and executive officers, our directors and executive officers are able to exercise significant influence over our management and affairs. For example, our directors and executive officers may be able to influence the outcome of director elections or block significant transactions, such as a merger or acquisition, or any other matter that might otherwise be approved by the shareholders.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur corporate organizational documents and certain corporate and banking provisions of Texas law to which it is subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of us that you may favor.\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of us. These provisions include (i) staggered terms for directors, who may only be removed for cause; (ii) authorization for our board of directors to issue shares of one or more series of preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine; (iii) a prohibition of shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent; (iv) a prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors; (v) a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election of directors and for shareholder proposals; and (vi) a limitation on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings to those shareholders or groups of shareholders owning at least 50.0% of the shares of our common stock that are issued, outstanding and entitled to vote. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control. Moreover, banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nOur certificate of formation contains an exclusive forum provision that limits the judicial forums where our shareholders may initiate derivative actions and certain other legal proceedings against us and our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of formation provides that the state and federal courts located in Montgomery County, Texas will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for certain causes of action, which may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of formation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17802, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STXB"}
