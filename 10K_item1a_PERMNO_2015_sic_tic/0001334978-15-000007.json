RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Global economic conditions have been slow to recover and remain uncertain. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, economic uncertainty increases or economic conditions deteriorate again, global economic conditions may once again adversely impact our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nWe performed impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012 and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $3.5 million, $13.2 million and $37.7 million, respectively. Although we believe we have made reasonable estimates and used appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our billboard permits and reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual market conditions and operational performance for the respective reporting units underlying the intangible assets were to deteriorate, or if facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived assets or goodwill for these reporting units below their adjusted carrying amounts, we may also be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTo service our debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures, we will require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs, which depends on many factors beyond our control\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures for display construction, renovation or maintenance will require a significant amount of cash. Our primary source of liquidity is cash on hand, cash flow from operations and the revolving promissory note with iHeartCommunications. Based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets, we believe that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, any available borrowing capacity under the senior revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity under or repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving promissory note with iHeartCommunications will enable us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations and other liquidity-generating transactions, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our future operating performance does not meet our expectation or our plans materially change in an adverse manner or prove to be materially inaccurate, we may need additional financing. In addition, the purchase price of possible acquisitions, capital expenditures for deployment of digital billboards and/or other strategic initiatives could require additional indebtedness or equity financing on our part. Adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of equity or debt financing. Consequently, there can be no assurance that such financing, if permitted under the terms of our financing agreements, will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. The inability to obtain additional financing in such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations or pursue strategic initiatives. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control\nCertain factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include:\n\u00b7 unfavorable economic conditions, which may cause companies to reduce their expenditures on advertising;\n\u00b7 an increased level of competition for advertising dollars, which may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or which may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match;\n\u00b7 unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u00b7 technological changes and innovations that we are unable to successfully adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive advertising alternatives than what we offer, which may lead to a loss of advertising customers or to lower advertising rates;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies, including increased eminent domain activity or changes to restrictions on rebuilding non-conforming structures, which could increase our taxes or other costs, reduce our outdoor advertising inventory or restrict the advertising media that we employ or restrict some or all of our customers that operate in regulated areas from using certain advertising media or from advertising at all;\n\u00b7 unfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective; and\n\u00b7 unfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nWe face intense competition in the outdoor advertising business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current advertising and sales revenues. We compete for advertising revenue with other outdoor advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as radio, newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, mobile devices, satellite radio and Internet-based services, within their respective markets. Market shares are subject to change, which could have the effect of reducing our revenue in that market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match.\nOur business is dependent on our management team and other key individuals\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our management team and other key individuals. A number of key individuals have joined us or assumed increased responsibilities over the past several years, including Robert W. Pittman, who became our Executive Chairman on October 2, 2011, C. William Eccleshare, who was promoted to be our Chief Executive Officer on January 24, 2012, and Richard J. Bressler, who became our Chief Financial Officer on July 29, 2013. Although we have entered into agreements with some members of our management team and certain other key individuals, we can give no assurance that all or any of our management team and other key individuals will remain with us, or that we won\u2019t continue to make changes to the composition of, and the roles and responsibilities of, our management team. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no legal obligation to remain with us, and may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. We are currently contemplating modifying certain roles and responsibilities of specified members of our management team to more align with their operational focus. If members of our management or key individuals decide to leave us in the future, if we decide to make further changes to the composition of, or the roles and responsibilities of, these individuals, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation of outdoor advertising may restrict our outdoor advertising operations\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates outdoor advertising on controlled roads in the United States. The HBA regulates the size and location of billboards, mandates a state compliance program, requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. Construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of billboards and the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by federal, state and local governments. From time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or\nsignificantly limited the construction of new outdoor advertising structures. Changes in laws and regulations affecting outdoor advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new outdoor advertising locations.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement, condemnation and amortization. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions. Amortization is the attempted forced removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads and generally prohibited along non-controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where provided by state and local law. Other regulations limit our ability to rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade non-conforming displays. In addition, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there occurs an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legislation or interpreted existing legislation to restrict or prohibit the installation of digital billboards, and we expect these efforts to continue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could reduce our operating income if those outcomes require removal or restrictions on the use of preexisting displays or limit growth of digital displays. In addition, if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our clients, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nInternational regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future international regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium and may require us to make significant expenditures to ensure compliance. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nAdditional restrictions on outdoor advertising of tobacco, alcohol and other products may further restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most European Union countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. Any significant reduction in alcohol-related advertising or advertising of other products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations\nWe collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about our consumers, business partners and advertisers. We are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our consumers, business partners and advertisers. Such restrictions could limit our ability to offer targeted advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection\nand privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities including damages to our relationships with business partners and advertisers\nAlthough we have implemented physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information as well as, consumer, business partner and advertiser personally identifiable information, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed; we could lose consumers, business partners and advertisers. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure in connection with remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety as well as zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws which may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not found when doing business in the United States\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the United States. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include:\n\u00b7 potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u00b7 hostility from local populations;\n\u00b7 the adverse effect of foreign exchange controls;\n\u00b7 government policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u00b7 investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7 expropriations of property without adequate compensation;\n\u00b7 the potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u00b7 the risk of insurrections;\n\u00b7 risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u00b7 difficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems;\n\u00b7 withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 changes in tax structure and level; and\n\u00b7 changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations.\nIn addition, because we own assets in foreign countries and derive revenues from our International operations, we may incur currency translation losses due to changes in the values of foreign currencies and in the value of the U.S. dollar. We cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe success of our street furniture and transit products businesses is dependent on our obtaining key municipal concessions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging from three to 20 years and have revenue share and/or fixed payment components. Our inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nFuture acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue additional acquisitions and may decide to dispose of certain businesses. These acquisitions or dispositions could be material. Our acquisition strategy involves numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 our acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows;\n\u00b7 to successfully manage our large portfolio of outdoor advertising and other properties, we may need to:\n\u00b7 recruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed, and\n\u00b7 expand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses, because failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management;\n\u00b7 we may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u00b7 we may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u00b7 our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nAdditional acquisitions by us may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from acquiring additional outdoor advertising businesses in any market where we already have a significant position.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with iHeartCommunications\nBecause iHeartCommunications controls substantially all of the total voting power of our common stock, investors will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote\nAs of December 31, 2014, iHeartCommunications indirectly owned (1) all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and (2) 6,553,971 shares of our Class A common stock, collectively representing approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock entitles its holder to 20 votes and each share of our Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote. As a result, as of December 31, 2014, iHeartCommunications controlled approximately 99% of the total voting power of our common stock.\nOn January 7, 2015, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock, increasing iHeartCommunications\u2019 collective holdings to slightly less than 90% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAs long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, it will have the ability to direct the election of all members of our board of directors and, therefore, to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of common stock or preferred stock, if applicable, and our payment of dividends in certain situations. Similarly, iHeartCommunications will have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the power to prevent an acquisition or any other change in control. Because iHeartCommunications\u2019 interests as our controlling stockholder may differ from other stockholders\u2019 interests, actions taken by iHeartCommunications with respect to us may not be favorable to all stockholders.\nOur agreements with iHeartCommunications impose obligations on, and iHeartCommunications\u2019 financing agreements effectively impose restrictions on, our ability to finance operations and capital needs, make acquisitions and engage in other business activities\nWe have entered into a Master Agreement, a Corporate Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, a Trademark License Agreement and a number of other agreements with iHeartCommunications setting forth various matters governing our relationship with iHeartCommunications while it remains a significant stockholder in us. These agreements allow iHeartCommunications to retain control over many aspects of our operations. We are not able to terminate these agreements or amend them in a manner we deem more favorable so long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock. iHeartCommunications\u2019 financing agreements also impose a number of restrictions on us.\nPursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement, we are obligated to use various corporate services provided by iHeartCommunications and its affiliates, including treasury, payroll and other financial services, certain executive officer services, human resources and employee benefit services, legal services, information systems and network services and procurement and sourcing support. Also pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement, substantially all of the cash generated from our domestic Americas operations is transferred daily into accounts of iHeartCommunications (after satisfying our controlled disbursement accounts and the funding requirements of the trustee accounts under the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes issued by Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours), where funds of ours and of iHeartCommunications are commingled, and recorded as \u201cDue from/to iHeartCommunications\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet. Net amounts owed between us and iHeartCommunications are evidenced by revolving promissory notes. We do not have any material committed external sources of capital independent from iHeartCommunications, and iHeartCommunications is not required to provide us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. In addition, we have no access to the cash transferred from us to iHeartCommunications other than our right to demand payment by iHeartCommunications\u2019 of the amounts owed to us under the revolving promissory note.\nThe \u201cDue from iHeartCommunications\u201d note previously was the subject of derivative litigation filed by our stockholders in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, our board of directors established a committee for the specific purpose of monitoring the Due from iHeartCommunications note. That committee has the non-exclusive authority to demand payments under the Due from iHeartCommunications note under certain specified circumstances tied to iHeartCommunications\u2019 liquidity or the amount outstanding under the Due from iHeartCommunications note as long as our board of directors declares a simultaneous dividend equal to the amount so demanded. Any future repayments and simultaneous dividends would further reduce the amount of the Due from iHeartCommunications note asset that is available to us as a source of liquidity for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements.\nIf iHeartCommunications were to become insolvent, we would be an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications. In such event, we would be treated the same as other unsecured creditors of iHeartCommunications and, if we were not entitled to amounts outstanding under such note, or could not obtain such cash on a timely basis, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the asset recorded in \u201cDue from iHeartCommunications\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet was $947.8 million and $879.1 million, respectively.\nIn addition, the Master Agreement and, in some cases, iHeartCommunications\u2019 financing agreements, include restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7 issue any shares of capital stock or securities convertible into capital stock;\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 make certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7 repurchase our stock;\n\u00b7 dispose of certain assets; and\n\u00b7 merge or consolidate.\nThe rights of iHeartCommunications under these agreements may allow iHeartCommunications to delay or prevent an acquisition of us that our other stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, the restrictions contained in these agreements limit our ability to finance operations and capital needs, make acquisitions or engage in other business activities, including our ability to grow and increase our revenue or respond to competitive changes.\nThe terms of our arrangements with iHeartCommunications may be more favorable than we would be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party, and we may be unable to replace the services iHeartCommunications provides us in a timely manner or on comparable terms\nWe negotiated our arrangements with iHeartCommunications in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship prior to the initial public offering of our Class A common stock. Although iHeartCommunications is contractually obligated to provide us with services during the term of the Corporate Services Agreement, we cannot assure you these services will be sustained at an appropriate level, or that we will be able to replace these services in a timely manner or on comparable terms. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the amount we pay iHeartCommunications for the services will be as favorable to us as that which may be available for comparable services provided by unrelated third parties. Other agreements with iHeartCommunications also govern our relationship with iHeartCommunications and provide for the allocation of employee benefit, tax and other liabilities and obligations attributable to our operations. The agreements also contain terms and provisions that may be more favorable than terms and provisions we might have obtained in arm\u2019s length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties. If iHeartCommunications ceases to provide services to us pursuant to those agreements, our costs of procuring those services from third parties may increase.\nConflicts of interest may arise between iHeartCommunications and us that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between iHeartCommunications and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. iHeartCommunications is owned indirectly by iHeartMedia. Two of our directors serve as directors of iHeartMedia. Three of our other directors are affiliated with iHeartMedia and its stockholders. In addition, five of our executive officers serve as executive officers of iHeartMedia.\nAreas in which conflicts of interest between iHeartCommunications and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 Cross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. The ownership interests of our directors or executive officers in the common stock of iHeartMedia or service as a director or officer of both iHeartMedia and us could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. For example, these decisions could relate to: (1) the nature, quality and cost of services rendered to us by iHeartCommunications; (2) disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition opportunity; (3) employee retention or recruiting; or (4) our capital structure, including our level of indebtedness and our dividend policy.\n\u00b7 Intercompany transactions. From time to time, iHeartCommunications or its affiliates may enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries or other affiliates. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between employees of iHeartCommunications and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of the independent directors on our board or a committee of disinterested directors, there can be no assurance the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained in arm\u2019s length negotiations.\n\u00b7 Intercompany agreements. We have entered into certain agreements with iHeartCommunications pursuant to which it provides us certain management, administrative, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we reimburse iHeartCommunications on a cost basis. In addition, we entered into a number of intercompany agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by iHeartCommunications for certain of our businesses. Pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement between iHeartCommunications and us, we are contractually obligated to utilize the services of certain executive officers of iHeartCommunications as our executive officers until iHeartCommunications owns shares of our common stock representing less than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, or we provide iHeartCommunications with six months prior written notice of termination. The terms of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations. In addition, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of these existing agreements.\nIf iHeartCommunications engages in the same type of business we conduct or takes advantage of business opportunities that might be attractive to us, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, iHeartCommunications will have no obligation to refrain from:\n\u00b7 engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; or\n\u00b7 doing business with any of our clients, customers or vendors.\nIn addition, the corporate opportunity policy set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation addresses potential conflicts of interest between our company, on the one hand, and iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia and its officers and directors who are officers or directors of our company, on the other hand. The policy provides that if iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both iHeartCommunications and us, we will have renounced our interest in the corporate opportunity. It also provides that if one of our directors or officers who is also a director or officer of iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia learns of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both iHeartCommunications and us, we will have renounced our interest in the corporate opportunity, unless that opportunity is expressly offered to that person in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer.\nIf one of our directors or officers, who also serves as a director or officer of iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia, learns of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both iHeartCommunications and us, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the director or officer will have no duty to communicate or present that corporate opportunity to us and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty by reason of iHeartCommunications\u2019 actions with respect to that corporate opportunity.\nThis policy could result in iHeartCommunications having rights to corporate opportunities in which both we and iHeartCommunications have an interest.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that may not provide as many protections as those afforded to stockholders of other companies\niHeartCommunications owns shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock and, as a result, we have elected to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt from the provisions of the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance standards requiring that: (1) a majority of our board consists of independent directors; (2) we have a nominating and governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and governed by a written charter addressing the nominating and governance committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and (3) we have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the compensation committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities. Although we currently have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the compensation committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, we currently do not have a nominating and governance committee and a majority of our board of directors currently does not consist of independent directors. We intend to continue using certain of these exemptions and, as a result: (1) we may not create or maintain a nominating and governance committee; (2) the nominating and governance committee (if one is created) and the compensation committee may not consist entirely of independent directors; and (3) our board of directors may not consist of a majority of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nWe do not have control over our tax decisions and could be liable for income taxes owed by iHeartCommunications\nAs long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our common stock, we and certain of our subsidiaries will be included in iHeartCommunications\u2019 consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes for all pre-merger periods and iHeartMedia\u2019s consolidated group for post-merger periods. In addition, we or one or more of our subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of iHeartCommunications for pre-merger periods and iHeartMedia for post-merger periods or one or more of its subsidiaries for foreign, state and local income tax purposes. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we pay to iHeartCommunications the amount of federal, foreign, state and local income taxes that we would be required to pay to the relevant taxing authorities if we and our subsidiaries filed combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns and were not included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries. In addition, by virtue of its controlling ownership and the Tax Matters Agreement, iHeartCommunications effectively controls all of our tax decisions. The Tax Matters Agreement provides that iHeartCommunications has the sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to file all income tax returns on our behalf and to determine the amount of our liability to (or entitlement to payment from) iHeartCommunications under the Tax Matters Agreement. This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between iHeartCommunications and us. For example, under the Tax Matters Agreement, iHeartCommunications is able to choose to contest, compromise, or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to iHeartCommunications and detrimental to us.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the Tax Matters Agreement, federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group\u2019s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent iHeartCommunications or other members of the group fail to make any United States federal income tax payments required by law, we would be liable for the shortfall. Similar principles may apply for\nforeign, state and local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state and local income tax purposes.\nIf iHeartCommunications spins off our Class B common stock to the iHeartMedia stockholders, we have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify iHeartCommunications for its tax-related liabilities in certain circumstances\nIf iHeartCommunications spins off our Class B common stock to the iHeartMedia\u2019s stockholders in a distribution intended to be tax-free under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to herein as the Code, we have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify iHeartCommunications and its affiliates against any and all tax-related liabilities if such a spin-off fails to qualify as a tax-free distribution (including as a result of Section 355(e) of the Code) due to actions, events or transactions relating to our stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the Tax Matters Agreement. If neither we nor iHeartCommunications is responsible under the Tax Matters Agreement for any such spin-off not being tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, we and iHeartCommunications have agreed to each be responsible for 50% of the tax-related liabilities arising from the failure of such a spin-off to so qualify.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock ownership by iHeartCommunications, provisions in our agreements with iHeartCommunications and our corporate governance documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that our other stockholders may consider favorable, which could decrease the value of your shares of Class A common stock\nAs long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, it will have the ability to control decisions regarding an acquisition of us by a third party. As a controlled company, we are exempt from some of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirement that our board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors, supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents, restrictions on a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent. Some of these provisions, such as the limitation on stockholder action by written consent, only become effective once iHeartCommunications no longer controls us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Delaware law also imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These restrictions under Delaware law do not apply to iHeartCommunications while it retains at least 15% or more of our Class B common stock. Although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nIf iHeartCommunications spins off our Class B common stock to the iHeartMedia stockholders and such shares do not convert into Class A common stock upon a sale or other transfer subsequent to such distribution, the voting rights of our Class A common stock will continue to be disproportionately lower than the voting rights of our Class B common stock\nIn connection with any distribution of shares of our Class B common stock to iHeartMedia\u2019s common stockholders in a spin-off, iHeartCommunications may elect in its sole discretion whether our Class B common stock so distributed will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon a transfer or sale by the recipient subsequent to the spin-off or whether the Class B common stock will continue as Class B common stock after the distribution. In the event the Class B common stock does not convert into Class A common stock upon a sale or transfer subsequent to a spin-off, the voting rights of Class A common stock will continue to be disproportionately lower than the voting rights of our Class B common stock. Therefore, the holders of our Class B common stock will continue to be able to direct the election of all the members of our board of directors and exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs.\nAn increase in the concentration of our stock ownership by iHeartCommunications could depress the market price for shares of our Class A common stock\nAs a result of the significant concentration of our stock ownership, we have a relatively small public float compared to the number of our shares outstanding, which may adversely affect the trading price for our Class A common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. On August 9, 2010, iHeartCommunications, our indirect parent entity, announced a stock purchase program under which iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries may purchase up to an aggregate of $100 million of our Class A common stock and/or the Class A common stock of iHeartMedia. As of December 31, 2014, a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications had purchased 6,553,971 shares of our Class A common stock. On January 7, 2015, a\nsubsidiary of iHeartCommunications purchased an additional 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock. Future stock purchases under this program would result in additional concentration of our stock ownership and further reduce our public float.\nFuture sales or distributions of our shares by iHeartCommunications could depress the market price for shares of our Class A common stock\niHeartCommunications may sell all or part of the shares of our common stock it owns or distribute those shares to the iHeartMedia stockholders, including pursuant to demand registration rights described in the Registration Rights Agreement between us and iHeartCommunications. Sales or distributions by iHeartCommunications of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or to the iHeartMedia stockholders could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock. iHeartCommunications has advised us it currently intends to continue to hold all of our common stock it owns. However, iHeartCommunications is not subject to any contractual obligation that would prohibit it from selling, spinning off, splitting off or otherwise disposing of any shares of our common stock. Consequently, we cannot assure you iHeartCommunications will maintain its ownership of our common stock.\nWe currently do not pay regular dividends on our Class A common stock\nOther than a special dividend paid by us on March 15, 2012, a special dividend paid by us on November 8, 2013 in connection with the settlement of litigation, and a special dividend paid by us on August 11, 2014, we have never paid dividends on our Class A common stock and are subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends should we seek to do so in the future. We are a holding company with no independent operations and no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. We, therefore, are dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cCCWH\u201d) senior notes and CCWH\u2019s senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. If we elect not to pay dividends in the future or are prevented from doing so, the price of our Class A common stock must appreciate in order to realize a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, we had $4.9 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including: (1) $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH\u2019s senior notes, which mature in November 2022; (2) $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH\u2019s senior subordinated notes, which mature in March 2020; and (3) $15.1 million of other debt. This large amount of indebtedness could have negative consequences for us, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing cash available for other purposes, including to fund operations and capital expenditures, invest in new technology and pursue other business opportunities;\n\u00b7 limiting our liquidity and operational flexibility and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7 requiring us to defer planned capital expenditures, reduce discretionary spending, sell assets, restructure existing indebtedness or defer acquisitions or other strategic opportunities;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to refinance any of our indebtedness or increasing the cost of any such financing;\n\u00b7 making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating performance, a decline in general economic or industry conditions or a disruption in the credit markets; and\n\u00b7 making us more susceptible to negative changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nIf compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take\nany of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, these actions may not be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements.\nOur ability to refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and increase our debt service obligations and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness we will be in default under one or more of our debt agreements and, as a result we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nBecause we derive a substantial portion of operating income from our subsidiaries, our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to dividend or distribute funds to us\nWe derive a substantial portion of operating income from our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and the ability to service our indebtedness depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability of those entities to distribute funds to us. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay to us the amounts necessary to service our debt.\nThe documents governing our indebtedness and iHeartCommunications\u2019 indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\nOur material financing agreements and iHeartCommunications\u2019 material financing agreements contain various covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7 make acquisitions or investments;\n\u00b7 make loans or otherwise extend credit to others;\n\u00b7 incur indebtedness or issue shares or guarantees;\n\u00b7 redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt;\n\u00b7 create liens;\n\u00b7 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets;\n\u00b7 merge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u00b7 make a substantial change to the general nature of our business.\nThese restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we would be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDowngrades in our and iHeartCommunications\u2019 credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, limit our financing options, reduce our flexibility under future financings and adversely affect our liquidity, and also may adversely impact our business operations\nOur and iHeartCommunications\u2019 corporate credit ratings are speculative-grade. Any reductions in our and iHeartCommunications\u2019 credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase the cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business operations.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
