{"cik": "1385508", "company": "OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities has a high degree of risk. Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all other information in this Annual Report on 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed and the value of our stock could go down. This means you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWith the exception of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, we have historically generated limited revenue to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of July 31, 2017, we have an accumulated deficit of $54.6 million. The likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays often encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common addictions and related disorders. These potential challenges include, but are not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial delays, poor data, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates. In order to complete certain clinical trials and otherwise operate pursuant to our current business strategy, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses. In addition, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund the operating losses and capital expenditures. We recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, we will not be able to continue operations as currently contemplated, complete planned clinical trials and/or achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability will also negatively impact the value of our securities. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company will most likely fail.\nWe may not succeed in completing the development of our product candidates, commercializing our products, and generating significant revenues.\nOur pipeline includes a treatment for BED, a treatment for BN, a treatment for CocUD, a heroin vaccine and additional treatment applications. Our products have generated limited revenues. Our ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, obtain market approval, successfully launch our products and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, we and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement, as amended by the Adapt Amendment entered into between the parties on December 13, 2016, that provides Adapt with a global license to develop and commercialize our intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, now known as NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray. The loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our treatment as planned and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of the treatment.\nThe future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to generate revenues from NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, for which we are dependent on many factors, including the performance of our licensing partner Adapt and competition in the market. In addition, we have no experience in commercializing the treatments on our own and face a number of challenges with respect to commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges:\n\u2022 having inadequate financial or other resources to complete the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the inability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration with third parties;\n\u2022 experiencing delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u2022 the inability to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u2022 healthcare professionals and patients may not accept our treatments;\n\u2022 we may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of our products since we have limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of our products;\n\u2022 technological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN, CocUD and heroin addiction may reduce the demand for our products;\n\u2022 changes in the market for reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with BED, BN, CocUD and heroin addiction, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with our market penetration efforts;\n\u2022 third-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our products, which may adversely affect patients\u2019 willingness to purchase our products;\n\u2022 uncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our products;\n\u2022 we may face third party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022 we may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products in our markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our products even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u2022 we our dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to our products and the products of our competitors. If data from a clinical trial is unfavorable, we would be reluctant to advance the specific product for the indication for which it was being developed.\nIf we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively commercialize our products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven our lack of revenue and cash flow, we will need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nSince we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding to continue the development of our product candidates, build our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity or develop or acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nWe do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of our product candidates and other business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to fund our business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of Common Stock. Given our need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like us, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for our stockholders.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our products or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our Chief Executive Officer and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Dr. Crystal would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and may result in the failure to reach our goals.\nOur future viability and ability to achieve sales and profits will also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, train, retain or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the failure to do so may severely damage its prospects.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates that are similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our products and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our products and product candidates that are important to our business, as appropriate. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending or that we may apply for in the future with respect to one or more of our products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we may enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, distribution partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued, the patents may not meaningfully protect our products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and third parties from commercializing competitive products or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner.\nChanges in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe cannot be certain that our patents and patent rights will be effective in protecting our products, product candidates and technologies. Failure to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may face litigation from third parties claiming that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, or seek to challenge the validity of our patents.\nOur future success is also dependent in part on the strength of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research and development. In addition to the litigation with TEVA discussed below, we may be exposed to additional future litigation by third parties seeking to challenge the validity of our rights based on claims that our technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or are invalid, or that the Company has misappropriated the trade secrets of others.\nSince our inception, we have sought to contract with manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of pharmaceutical formulations and products. As a result, we have disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of our technology with potential manufacturers and suppliers. We believe that these disclosures, while necessary for our business, may have resulted and may result in the attempt by potential manufacturers and suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to our technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing and supplier rights.\nWithin the last 12 months, we, Adapt Pharma, Inc. (\u201cAdapt Inc.\u201d) and Adapt (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) have filed four separate complaints for patent infringement against Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (\u201cTeva Ltd.\u201d) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Ltd. (\u201cTeva USA\u201d and, together with Teva Ltd., \u201cTeva\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Teva USA\u2019s filing of ANDA No. 209522 (the \u201cTeva ANDA\u201d) with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN\u00ae before the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 9,211,253 (the \u201c\u2019253 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 9,468,747 (the \u201c\u2019747 patent\u201d), U.S. Patent No. 9,561,177 (the \u201c\u2019177 patent\u201d) and U.S. Patent No. 9,629,965 (the \u201c\u2019965 patent\u201d), each of which are owned by us. For more information about this litigation, see Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings. We maintain full confidence in our intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN\u00ae and expect that the \u2018253 patent, the \u2018747 patent, the \u2018177 patent and the \u2018965 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. There can be no assurances that we will be successful with respect to these litigation matters or any other litigation matters which may arise in the ordinary course of our business. Such a failure may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.\nWe rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our products and product candidates. In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patents covering our products and product candidates normally provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for our products and product candidates to become profitable.\nCertain of our patents will expire in the next 17 years. While we are seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection, our products and product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Products\nWe may be exposed to product liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should we be sued.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against us. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot give assurances that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that we may obtain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from our products and product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the products have been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the products to be harder and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to our products and product candidates. The results of our planned or any future clinical trials may show that our products and product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings. If our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of our products:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force us to remove its products from the market;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies and others;\n\u2022 we may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the products;\n\u2022 we may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;\n\u2022 sales of the products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the products or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience marketing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products after approval, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe do not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize our products or any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of its products. The establishment and development of our own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales, marketing and distribution of our products. There also may be certain markets within the U.S. and elsewhere for our products for which we may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell our products on favorable terms, or at all. In the event we are unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing and sales organization, we will not be able to commercialize our products or any other product candidates that we develop, which will negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products, we would likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nThe market for our products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and products noncompetitive or obsolete. We also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us.\nOur reliance on collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize our products, such as the Adapt Agreement to develop and commercialize our intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, is subject to inherent risks and may result in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting our ability to commercialize our products and adversely affecting our profitability.\nWith respect to the products we have licensed, we depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop these product candidates and also depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize our existing and possibly future product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements with others. We also engage, and intend in the future to continue to engage, contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators.\nIn addition, although not a primary component of our current strategy, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us in the past, and may continue to require us, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others, including other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates would typically require us to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. Furthermore, these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed our product candidates and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates.\nContractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us or reduce their payments to us under those agreements on limited or no notice and for no reason or reasons outside of our control. For example, we may be unable to maintain our relationship with Adapt on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, as the Adapt agreement may be terminated by Adapt in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to us. In addition, Adapt may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors or larger customers which may negatively impact our relationship with Adapt. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt as a key partner could have a materially significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of our products. The same could apply to other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our dependence upon third parties to assist with the development and commercialization of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our License Agreement No. 2 with Aegis shall expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties under such License Agreement No. 2; provided, however, that we shall have the right to terminate the License granted on a Product-by-Product or country-by-country basis upon 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to Aegis.\nIf our current or future licensees exercise termination rights they may have, or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, or for other reasons, and we are not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates. Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements we may enter into may not be on terms favorable to us.\nA further risk we face with the collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborator or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us.\nOur current or any future collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful. Our agreements with collaborators typically allows them discretion in electing whether to pursue various development, regulatory, commercialization and other activities, such as the Adapt Agreement.\nIf any collaborator were to breach its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated.\nOther risks associated with our collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following:\n\u2022 we may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators;\n\u2022 our collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or technologies that are incorporated into the products we develop with them;\n\u2022 third parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations; and\n\u2022 we may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements; and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.\nThese factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products or reduction in the milestone payments we receive, or could result in us not being able to commercialize our products. Further, disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products will be delayed or may never be realized.\nWe are exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. Any claim under any existing insurance policies or any insurance policies secured in the future may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability we may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the products we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Industry\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.\nIn the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our future products, and we could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.\nWe are subject to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where our products are and product candidates may be sold.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including our product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials we conduct post-approval. As a result, we are subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:\n\u2022 clinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 our clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; we do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;\n\u2022 the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022 we rely on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates and if we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGMP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 if the clinical development process is completed successfully, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of our product candidates will depend on us first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022 there is no assurance that we will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of our product candidates for any indication; we are subject to government regulation for the commercialization of our product candidates\n\u2022 we have not received regulatory approval in the U.S. for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates;\n\u2022 even if one or more of our product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than our requests, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;\n\u2022 undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022 later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities could subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022 the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained; and\n\u2022 we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of our business.\nIn addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be present, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 Federal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022 State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the symbol \u201cOPNT.\u201d The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The trading price our Common Stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022 limited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;\n\u2022 fluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to our financial performance;\n\u2022 our performance in the execution of our business plan;\n\u2022 financial viability;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022 announcements of developments us or our competitors;\n\u2022 market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 sales of our Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in both the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022 performance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u2022 economic and other external factors;\n\u2022 period-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and;\n\u2022 other events or factors, including the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nSecurities analysts do not currently and may not in the future cover us, which may have a negative impact on the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over independent analysts and currently we are not covered by any such independent analysts. We have engaged various non-independent analysts historically, including Zacks Investment Research currently, to cover our business. If no independent securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price for our Common Stock may continue to be negatively impacted.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy from time to time as circumstances dictate.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors control the direction of our business by means of a significant collective ownership of our Common Stock. The concentrated beneficial ownership of our Common Stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nDr. Roger Crystal, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Kevin Pollack, a former director, our former Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, David D. O\u2019Toole, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Dr. Michael Sinclair, our Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, Geoffrey Wolf, a director, Ann MacDougall, a director, Thomas T. Thomas, a director, and Dr. Gabrielle Silver, a director, collectively beneficially own approximately 68.22% of our outstanding Common Stock as of October 10, 2017. As a result, such executive officers and directors effectively control the Company and have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from such executive officers and directors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders from changing the direction of our business or management.\nAfter giving effect to our merger into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated, and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change our direction or management. For example, these provisions:\n\u00b7 prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7 establish a staggered board of directors such that all members of the Board are not elected at one time;\n\u00b7 allow only the Board to fill any vacancy in the Board by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, or if the number of directors shall be increased; and\n\u00b7 require a vote of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove a director.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange and no assurances can be made about stock performance, liquidity, or maintenance of our Nasdaq listing.\nHistorically, our Common Stock was quoted on the OTCQB, which provided significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq). On August 24, 2017, our Common Stock was approved for trading on Nasdaq. Beginning on August 29, 2017, our Common Stock began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cOPNT.\u201d Although currently listed on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet Nasdaq\u2019s minimum listing requirements or that of any other national exchange. In addition, there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be created for our Common Stock. If we are unable to maintain listing on the Nasdaq or if a liquid market for our Common Stock does not develop, our Common Stock may remain thinly traded.", "PERMNO": 16904, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPNT"}
