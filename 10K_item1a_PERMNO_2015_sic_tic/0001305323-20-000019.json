{"cik": "1305323", "company": "Zovio Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the information set forth in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may impact our business operations. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Conversion Transaction and Proposed Change in the Structure of Our Operations\nThe Conversion Transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals that if not obtained, could delay or prevent its consummation, and an excessive delay in finalizing the Conversion Transaction could disrupt our business during its pendency.\nThe Conversion Transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals both prior to and following the conversion. There can be no assurances that these regulatory approvals will be obtained on the currently contemplated timeline or at all. In addition, as a condition to granting these regulatory approvals, a regulatory authority may require changes to the structure of the Conversion Transaction, and these changes may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. A material delay in obtaining such approvals may create uncertainty or otherwise have negative consequences, including adverse changes in our relationships with Ashford\u2019s students, vendors and faculty; adverse impacts on employee recruiting and retention efforts; and diversion of management\u2019s attention and internal resources from ongoing business, any of which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required regulatory approvals will be granted. Whether or not the Conversion Transaction is consummated, while it is pending, we will continue to incur costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Conversion Transaction.\nIf the Conversion Transaction is consummated, we will be subject to various risks and uncertainties arising out of the changes in the structure of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and our stock price.\nHaving obtained most regulatory approvals and agreed upon the general structure and major terms and conditions regarding the Conversion Transaction, if it is ultimately consummated, then various aspects of our operations would change in important ways. These changes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Following the Conversion Transaction, we would no longer own and operate a regulated institution of higher education, but we would instead be an education technology service provider to AU NFP and possibly other third-party education providers. While the services we would provide are services that we provide as part of our business today, we have no experience operating solely as an education technology service provider to third parties.\n\u2022Initially, all of our revenue would be derived pursuant to the services agreement with AU NFP. Accordingly, AU NFP\u2019s ability to increase its enrollment and tuition and fee revenue, and our ability to continue to perform the services necessary to enable AU NFP to achieve such goals, would be critical to the success of our services business.\n\u2022The letter of credit requirement by the Department will impact our future cash flows as an education technology service provider.\nIf the Conversion Transaction is consummated, but we are unable to successfully re-focus our business to providing education technology services to third-party education providers, or if the contemplated services agreement with AU NFP fails to achieve the anticipated levels of performance, then our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our stock price, could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the Department does not approve the change of control related to the Conversion Transaction and recertify Ashford to continue participating in the Title IV programs, its students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or there are significant limitations as a condition of Ashford\u2019s continued participation in the Title IV programs, as a service provider to Ashford, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our stock price, could be materially and adversely affected.\nInstitutions are required to seek recertification from the Department on a regular basis in order to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the Department if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by the Department regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. Ashford\u2019s conversion to nonprofit status as a part of the Conversion Transaction, if consummated, would constitute a change in control of Ashford. The Department conducted an abbreviated preacquisition review of the change of control and is expected to conduct a post-closing review of Ashford following the change of control resulting from the Conversion Transaction, if consummated. See \u201cRegulation - U.S. Department of Education Abbreviated Preacquisition Review Letter\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d There can be no assurance that the Department will recertify Ashford or that the Department will not impose conditions or other restrictions on Ashford as a condition of granting Ashford a provisional certification following the proposed change in control. If the Department does not renew, or withdraws, the certification of Ashford to participate in the Title IV programs at any time, Ashford\u2019s students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the Department could renew Ashford\u2019s certification, but restrict or delay Ashford\u2019s students\u2019 receipt of Title IV funds, limit the students to whom Ashford could disburse funds, decline to approve Ashford as a nonprofit institution for Title IV purposes, impose an increase in the letter of credit requirement, or place other restrictions on Ashford.\nAny of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on us. If the Conversion Transaction is consummated, we would no longer own or operate Ashford, and we would no longer participate in the Title IV programs as an institution. However, we would face the risks discussed above in connection with providing services to Ashford as a third-party education technology services provider, including adverse effects on our business and operations from a reduction or loss in our revenues under the contemplated services agreement if Ashford loses or has limits placed on its Title IV eligibility.\nAs we transition to become an education technology services company, the separation of Ashford via the Conversion Transaction, may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated and failure to complete, or any delay of, the separation of Ashford from Zovio Inc may negatively impact our planned business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are planning the separation of Ashford from Zovio pursuant to the Conversion Transaction, which may be subject to a number of conditions including, among other things, regulatory approval. The Company announced that in connection with the Conversion Transaction, the Department indicated that it would require AU NFP to the 25% LOC. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Conversion Transaction will be satisfied, or that the separation will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all. Other unanticipated developments could further delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the separation of the university, including disruptions in the capital and other financial markets, among other things. If the separation of the university is not completed or is delayed, we will be subject to several risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022a failure to complete the separation and transition or a delay in such events could result in a negative perception by the market of the Company generally and a resulting decline in the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022the Company and Ashford may experience negative reactions from its employees and business partners;\n\u2022there may be substantial disruption to our business and a distraction of our management team and employees from day-to-day operations, because matters related to the separation and transition have required substantial commitments of time and financial and other resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial; and\n\u2022even if the Conversion Transaction occurs as planned, the 25% LOC may be costly.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nIf Ashford fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, they could face monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be (i) legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, (ii) accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department as a reliable indicator of educational quality and (iii) certified as an eligible institution by the Department. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulation by the\nDepartment, WSCUC, and state education agencies. These regulatory requirements cover many aspects of our operations. Given that the Department, WSCUC and state education agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements, we cannot reliably predict how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply with all the requirements. If Ashford fails to comply with these regulatory requirements, the Department could impose sanctions on that institution, including monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d If Ashford were to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or were to have such participation substantially curtailed, enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAshford must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification.\nAn institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification. The Department may review an institution's continued certification to participate in Title IV programs in the event of a change of control, and may take emergency action to suspend an institution's certification without advance notice if it determines the institution is violating Title IV requirements and immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. If the Department revokes or does not renew Ashford's certifications to participate in Title IV programs, Ashford's students would no longer be able to receive Title IV funds, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford is provisionally certified by the Department, which may make it more vulnerable to unfavorable Department action and place additional regulatory burdens on its operations.\nAshford is currently provisionally certified by the Department until March 31, 2021 and is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2020. The Department typically places an institution on provisional certification following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, and may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with certain standards of administrative capability or financial responsibility. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions. For example, Ashford's provisional status could subject it to additional sanctions if the Department were to find that Ashford engaged in substantial misrepresentation, including the revocation of its program participation agreement or the imposition of limitations on its participation in Title IV programs. In addition, an institution that is provisionally certified must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including, but not limited to, the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. Any adverse action by the Department or increased regulatory burdens as a result of Ashford's provisional status could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford's failure to maintain accreditation would denigrate the value of their educational programs and result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department to participate in Title IV programs. Ashford is accredited by WSCUC. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Accreditation - Evaluations and renewals of accreditation\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d WSCUC is recognized by the Department as a reliable authority regarding the quality of education and training provided by the institutions it accredits. To remain accredited, Ashford must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. If Ashford fails to satisfy any of the standards of its accrediting agency, it could lose its accreditation. Loss of accreditation would denigrate the value of its educational programs and would result in its loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf WSCUC loses recognition by the Department, Ashford could lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Department. WSCUC is recognized by the Department. If the Department ceased to recognize WSCUC for any reason, Ashford would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs unless the Department continued to certify the eligibility of the institution to participate in Title IV programs. The Department may continue to certify an institution for a period of no longer than 18 months after the date on which recognition of the accrediting body ceased. The inability of Ashford to participate in\nTitle IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if it is not legally authorized to operate in the states in which it is physically located.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - State authorization\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Ashford's California facilities have been designated as its main campus for Title IV purposes. Ashford has been authorized by the California BPPE to operate in California, is authorized by the State Board to operate an administrative center in Arizona, is authorized by the Commission to operate as a place of business in Colorado and is registered as a postsecondary school in Iowa by ICSAC. To maintain these authorizations and registrations, Ashford must comply with applicable requirements under the statutes and rules of the applicable state. Any loss of authorization to operate by Ashford and the resulting imposition of sanctions, including the loss of authorization to deliver educational programs and grant degrees and other credentials and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the regulations of various states where we are not physically located could preclude us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states or result in such students being ineligible to receive Title IV funds.\nDepartment regulations provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements to legally offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that offer educational services to students who reside in the state or that advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. We have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency, and we have obtained state education agency approvals in certain states as determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - State Education Licensure and Regulation - Additional state regulation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nOur changing business and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to regularly evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. Although Ashford has a process for evaluating the compliance of its online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states, and are subject to change. Consequently, a state education agency could disagree with our conclusion that we are not required to obtain a license or authorization in the state or could determine that we are not in compliance with state requirements, and may subject us to sanctions including the loss of state licensure or authorization, imposition of restrictions on our activities in the state, or imposition of fines and penalties. In addition, any failure to comply with state regulatory requirements, or any enactment of new or modified state regulations, may result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford is approved by the California BPPE to operate in California, which presents a greater reporting burden and may subject the university to increased regulatory or political scrutiny.\nIn connection with its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes and submitted an Application for Approval to Operate an Accredited Institution to the California BPPE on September 10, 2013. To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, often called \u201chome state authorization.\u201d Ashford is approved by the California BPPE to operate as an accredited institution in California and for its home state authorization. As a result, the university is subject to laws and regulations applicable to private, postsecondary educational institutions located in California, including reporting requirements related to graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies. There is current legislation that may significantly increase that regulatory burden. Compliance with the existing or increased regulations arising as a result of Ashford's operation as a California BPPE-approved institution may result in material additional costs of Ashford which could have a material, adverse effect on our profitability. Ashford also remains subject to other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements. Compliance with the additional reporting and disclosure obligations arising as a result of Ashford's operation as a California BPPE-approved institution may result in material additional costs and increased regulatory or political scrutiny of the university.\nAshford could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if it derives more than 90% of its respective cash revenues from these programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. This rule is commonly referred to as the \u201c90/10 rule.\u201d Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ashford derived 72.4% of their respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds. Ashford continues to monitor their respective 90/10 rule calculations and their compliance with the 90/10 rule.\nRevenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule, and accordingly helps Ashford satisfy the 90/10 rule. If there were a reduction in funding of government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or if our revenue derived from such funding were otherwise to decrease, it could be significantly more difficult for Ashford to satisfy the 90/10 rule. For additional information, see Note 19, \u201cRegulatory\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nChanges in federal law that increase Title IV grant and loan limits may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs and make it more difficult for Ashford to satisfy the 90/10 rule. In addition, Congress could propose and adopt legislation that amends the 90/10 rule in ways that make it more difficult for Ashford to satisfy the 90/10 rule. Failure to satisfy the 90/10 rule could result in losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if too many students default on their loans.\nFor each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a \u201ccohort default rate.\u201d An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford for the 2016, 2015 and 2014 federal fiscal years were 13.7%, 13.5% and 14.9%, respectively. If too many of Ashford's students were to default on their loans resulting in an increase in Ashford's respective cohort default rates, Ashford may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure of Ashford to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Financial responsibility\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d One measure of financial responsibility is an institution's composite score, a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. An institution's composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department oversight. If Ashford is found not to have satisfied the Department's financial responsibility requirements, they could be limited in their access to or lose Title IV program funding, or they may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to their participation in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Department historically has calculated Ashford\u2019s composite score based on our consolidated audited financial statements, rather than the institution\u2019s stand-alone audited financial statements. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our consolidated composite score calculated was 2.2, satisfying the composite score requirement of the Department's financial responsibility test. We expect our consolidated composite score for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 to be 0.7 and below the composite score requirement as a result of non-recurring restructuring and acquisition related charges unrelated to Ashford. However, the deadline to submit audited financial statements to the Department is June 30, 2020, by which date we expect that Ashford will have been separated from Zovio as a result of the Conversion Transaction currently scheduled to close on or before June 1, 2020. Following closing, Ashford will submit stand-alone audited financial statements to the Department for purposes of satisfying the composite score requirement of the financial responsibility standards. We expect Ashford\u2019s composite score, based on its stand-alone audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, to be at least 1.6 and above the Department\u2019s requirement for a composite score of 1.5 or higher. If the Conversion Transaction is not completed\nas scheduled or the Department calculates Ashford\u2019s composite score based on Zovio\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the institution\u2019s composite score for the period ended December 31, 2019 would be below the required composite score of at least 1.5. In such event, to continue participation in Title IV programs, the institution could be required to submit a letter of credit and agree to other conditions or restrictions on its Title IV participation. We also are subject to additional financial responsibility standards contained in the 2016 defense to repayment regulations and in the amended regulations that take effect on July 1, 2020. See \u201cRegulation - Defense to repayment.\u201d\nAdditionally, the separation of Ashford from Zovio through the Conversion Transaction will be subject to a post-closing review by the Department and, as previously reported, the Department indicated that it would require, along with other conditions, the posting of a letter of credit with the Department within ten days of the Conversion Transaction. See \u201cRegulation - U.S. Department of Education Abbreviated Preacquisition Review Letter\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nIf the institution is unable to submit a required letter of credit or to comply with any other applicable conditions or restrictions on its Title IV, the institution could lose its eligibility for Title IV program funding and be subject to other sanctions. The requirement that the institution submit a letter of credit and be subject to other conditions or restrictions on the institution\u2019s Title IV participation, or any limitation or loss of the institution\u2019s Title IV eligibility, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. Our systems and processes may not always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened because we are an online education provider. We must maintain systems and processes to successfully identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.\nThe Department's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the OIG credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department may find that we do not satisfy its \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. In addition, Ashford's ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on their maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Department. Under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering distance learning programs, as Ashford does, must require such institutions to have processes by which they establish that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause Ashford to fail to meet their accrediting agencies' standards and result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of such accrediting agencies. Any failure to satisfy the Department's administrative capability requirements or any loss of accreditation as a result of a failure to detect and prevent fraudulent activity could result in limits on or loss of Ashford's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if it pays incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from providing any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities or making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. The criteria for complying with the Department's rules prohibiting incentive compensation are not clear in all circumstances, and the Department will not review or approve compensation plans prior to their implementation.\nIf it were determined that Ashford violated the incentive compensation rule, the institution could be subject to monetary liabilities or administrative action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if the Department or other federal agencies determine they have misrepresented the nature of educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Given the Department's broad definition of \u201csubstantial misrepresentation,\u201d it is possible that despite our training efforts and compliance programs, Ashford's employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. In addition to the Department's prohibition on substantial misrepresentation, for-profit educational institutions are subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC and the CFPB. In addition, the Department completed its off-site program review to assess Ashford's administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Compliance reviews, audits and reports - Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford University\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nIf the Department determines that Ashford has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may (i) attempt to revoke the institution's program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified, (ii) impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs if the institution is provisionally certified, (iii) deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters or (iv) initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Because Ashford is provisionally certified, it could be subject to the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above in addition to any other actions taken by the Department. The imposition of these sanctions, including the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if it fails to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion, and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result in an institution having to post a letter of credit equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution may also be subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV programs. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ashford did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled.\nThe reinstatement of the 2016 regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment expand the circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment against an institution and provide that certain conditions or events could trigger, automatically or in some cases at the Department\u2019s discretion, a requirement that an institution post a letter of credit or other security that could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nAs of October 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia reinstated the 2016 regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment. The regulations allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable nondefault contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower\u2019s loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.\nUnder the reinstated regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment, Ashford could face claims by students based on the expanded circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment of their student loans, and the Department may be entitled to seek recoupment of student loans discharged pursuant to the regulations. The FSA is currently investigating representations made by Ashford to potential and enrolled students, and has asked the Company and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford\u2019s compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. In addition, Ashford is from time to\ntime subject to certain actions or investigations by various state, federal or accrediting agencies, and as a public company we would be subject to the additional triggering events outlined by the Department in the new regulations; therefore, we may be required to post a letter of credit or provide some other form of security to the Department, which could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Any assertion by Ashford students of defenses to repayment, including any resulting liability to, or remedial action against, Ashford, and any significant restrictions imposed on us or our ability to operate resulting from a requirement to post a letter of credit or other security, could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Department\u2019s new regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment may expand the circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment against an institution and may also provide that certain conditions or events could trigger a requirement that an institution post a letter of credit or other security that could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nThe current standard for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment of a student loan allows borrowers to assert a defense to repayment if a cause of action would have arisen under applicable state law. On June 14, 2017, the Department announced a postponement of proposed changes to defense to repayment regulations and its intention to resubmit the regulations through the negotiated rulemaking process. The Department announced an additional postponement on October 24, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Department announced they are postponing the effective date of this rule until July 1, 2019 so they can complete the negotiated rulemaking process and develop the new regulations. Because the negotiated rulemaking committee did not reach consensus, the Department published a proposed regulation through a NPRM, took public comment, and planned to issue final regulations by November 1, 2018, effective July 1, 2019. While rulemaking occurs, the Department will continue to process claims under the current borrower defense rules.\nUnder any new regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment, Ashford could face claims by students based on expanded circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment of their student loans, and the Department may be entitled to seek recoupment of student loans discharged pursuant to the regulations. The FSA is currently investigating representations made by Ashford to potential and enrolled students, and has asked the Company and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford\u2019s compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. In addition, Ashford is from time to time subject to certain actions or investigations by various state, federal or accrediting agencies, and as a public company we could be subject to the additional triggering events outlined by the Department in new regulations; therefore, we may be required to post a letter of credit or provide some other form of security to the Department, which could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Any assertion by Ashford's students of defenses to repayment, including any resulting liability to, or remedial action against, Ashford, and any significant restrictions imposed on us or our ability to operate resulting from a requirement to post a letter of credit or other security, could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford cannot offer new programs, expand its physical operations into certain states or acquire additional schools if such actions are not approved in a timely fashion by the applicable regulatory agencies, and Title IV funds disbursed to students enrolled in any such programs, states or acquired schools may have to be repaid if prior approval is not obtained.\nOur operating plans may include the offering of new educational programs by Ashford, some of which may require regulatory approval. In addition, Ashford may increase physical operations in additional states. Because Ashford is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. If we or Ashford are unable to obtain the necessary approvals for such new programs, operations or acquisitions or, in the case of Ashford, a substantial change, from the Department, WSCUC or any applicable state education agency or other accrediting agency, or if we or Ashford are unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, the ability to consummate such actions and provide Title IV funds to any affected students would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we, or Ashford, was to determine erroneously that any such action did not require approval or that all required approvals have been obtained, Ashford could be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds provided to students in the affected program or at the affected location, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf regulators do not approve, or if they delay their approval of, transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nWe must seek approval of a change of ownership resulting in a change of control under the standards of the Department, and/or applicable state education agencies. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV\nPrograms - Change in ownership resulting in a change of control\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d A failure by us or Ashford to reestablish its Department certification, accreditation or state authorization, as applicable, following a change of control could result in a suspension or loss of operating authority or the ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGovernmental proceedings or other claims and lawsuits asserting regulatory noncompliance could result in monetary liabilities or penalties, injunctions or loss of Title IV funding for students at Ashford.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we and Ashford are subject to compliance reviews, claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against such lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. In addition, claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such claims and lawsuits are eventually determined to be without merit. For additional information, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAdditional regulations or regulatory scrutiny resulting from action by the Department could result in increased compliance costs, fines, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOn December 16, 2016, the Department released final regulations to clarify state authorization requirements for postsecondary institutions offering distance education that participate in federal student loan programs, as required by the Higher Education Act. Among other things, the final regulations (i) require institutions offering distance education to be authorized by each state in which they enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state, (ii) require institutions to document the state process for resolving student complaints regarding distance education programs, (iii) require public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students in distance education programs, including disclosures regarding adverse actions taken against the institution, the institution\u2019s refund policies and whether each of the institution\u2019s programs meet applicable state licensure or certification requirements, and (iv) require institutions to explain to students the consequences of moving to a state where the school is not authorized, which could include loss of eligibility for federal student aid. The final regulations recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, as long as the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own consumer laws. The final regulations were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2018, however, on May 25, 2018, the Department published a NPRM in the Federal Register announcing the postponement, until July 1, 2020, of the effective date of the final regulations. The Department delayed the regulations based on concerns raised by regulated parties and to ensure that there would be adequate time to conduct negotiated rulemaking to reconsider the final regulations, and as necessary, develop revised regulations.\nWe cannot predict the scope and content of the regulations that may emerge from these or other rulemaking activities that the Department initiates. The Company\u2019s compliance with these regulations or any additional or modified regulations, could result in direct and indirect costs related to compliance, increased scrutiny, fines, liabilities, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAny action by Congress to revise the laws governing Title IV programs or to reduce funding for these programs could negatively impact our business.\nCongress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014, and on December 13, 2017, the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Education and the Workforce passed H.R. 4508, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (\u201cPROSPER Act\u201d). No date has been set for consideration by the full House on the legislation, nor has a companion Higher Education Act reauthorization bill been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.\nWe cannot predict what legislation, if any, will arise out of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act or other Congressional deliberations, or what impact any such legislation might have on the for-profit education sector and our business. However, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the eligibility of Ashford or students to\nparticipate in Title IV programs, or that requires us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our profit margin, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other postsecondary institutions.\nIn recent years, Congressional, federal, state and accrediting agency investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several postsecondary educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with Department regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the postsecondary sector may negatively impact public perceptions of all postsecondary educational institutions. Such allegations could result in increased scrutiny and regulation of all postsecondary institutions, including Ashford, by the Department, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities.\nAs a result of changes that have been made, or that may be required by the accreditors of Ashford, to our operational relationships with Ashford and to its operations and business models, our historical financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of future results.\nIn connection with the WSCUC accreditation and our efforts to structure our operations to meet evolving regulatory expectations, Ashford has made operational changes and launched various new business initiatives, and additional changes may be required. These changes and initiatives included hiring new leadership, implementing smaller class sizes, requiring minimum age-levels for students, implementing the Ashford Promise (an initiative that allows students a full refund for all tuition and fees through the third week of a student's first class), hiring additional full-time faculty and implementing new program review models. Many of these changes and initiatives result in higher expense to the organization, primarily in the areas of instructional costs and services. In addition, we have made changes in our organizational structure and operational relationships with Ashford to ensure its academic independence and satisfaction of accreditation-related requirements. Some of these changes and initiatives have contributed to declines in new student enrollments. Accordingly, our historical results and trends, including enrollments, admissions advisory and marketing expenses, and instructional costs and services, may not be indicative of our future results, and there can be no assurance that changes to our operational relationship with Ashford or other changes we have made, or may make in the future, will not have an adverse impact on regulatory compliance, satisfaction of accreditation-related standards, or our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, and to recruit and retain, students; adverse publicity may negatively impact demand for Ashford's programs or those of our other subsidiaries.\nBuilding awareness among potential students of Ashford and the programs it offers is critical to their ability to attract prospective students. It is also critical to our success that these prospective students are converted to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in Ashford's programs. Some of the factors that could prevent the successful recruiting and retention of students in Ashford's programs include:\n\u2022the emergence of more and better competitors;\n\u2022factors related to our marketing efforts, including the costs of online advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022performance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022Ashford's failure to maintain accreditation, state licensure and eligibility for Title IV programs;\n\u2022student dissatisfaction with Ashford's services and programs;\n\u2022a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from Ashford's programs or programs provided by private sector postsecondary education companies generally;\n\u2022adverse publicity regarding us, or online or private sector postsecondary education generally;\n\u2022price reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match; and\n\u2022a decline in the acceptance of online education or education provided by private sector postsecondary education companies.\nWe face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a wide range of matters. We are the subject of complaints alleging violations of various laws including, but not limited to, federal securities laws (including a securities class action), and the California State Attorney General. Additionally, derivative shareholder complaints have also been asserted on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. These and other legal proceedings could cause us to incur significant defense costs, are disruptive to our normal business operations and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. An adverse outcome of any legal proceeding could result in monetary losses or restrictions on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding current material legal proceedings involving us and our subsidiaries, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIf our bad debt expense increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAs a percentage of revenues, our bad debt expense has decreased from 5.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe our bad debt expense is primarily driven by operational policies, timing of financial aid processing and collection management. If our bad debt expense increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA failure of our information systems to properly store, process and report relevant data may reduce our management\u2019s effectiveness, interfere with our regulatory compliance and increase our operating expenses.\nWe are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford relies on a third-party vendor to provide the online learning platform for students and related support and hosting.\nWe have a license agreement with Instructure pursuant to which we license an online Canvas learning management system and platform for students at Ashford. Ashford currently relies on Instructure for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems. If Instructure ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with Ashford, or if our agreement with Instructure is otherwise terminated, the online learning platform for students at Ashford and related administrative support and hosting could be interrupted or become unavailable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations as a result of our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of such laws or regulations, or any security or cybersecurity breach, theft or loss of such information, could adversely affect our business.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our applicants, students, faculty and staff. We also collect and maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our services can be accessed globally through the internet. Therefore, we may be subject to the application of national privacy laws in countries outside the United States from which applicants and students access our services. Such privacy laws could impose conditions that limit the way we market and provide our services.\nOur computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, employee theft or misuse, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security and cybersecurity threats. Confidential information may also inadvertently become available to third parties when we integrate systems or migrate data to our servers following an acquisition of a school or in connection with periodic hardware or software upgrades. Due to the sensitive nature of the personal information stored on our servers, our networks may be targeted by hackers seeking to access this data. Users who circumvents security measures could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy for current or prospective students or employees.\nPossession and use of personal information also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and could restrict our use of personal information, and a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us or lawsuits brought against us. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security and cybersecurity breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors regarding Ashford's students and their families or our employees, or a violation of laws or regulations relating to the same, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result in lawsuits and result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance. The adoption of new or modified state or federal data or cybersecurity legislation could increase our costs and/or require changes in our operating procedures or systems.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our results and disclosures, as well as our processes and related controls. For additional information, see Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our technology infrastructure could damage the reputation of Ashford and our other subsidiaries, and negatively impact our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure (including the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online learning platform, student information system, and lead management system) is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or Ashford's students and negatively impact our business and reputation. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security problems. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats, these efforts may not protect our computer networks against all threats of security breaches, which could damage the reputation of Ashford and our other subsidiaries, and negatively impact our business and prospects.\nOur expenses may cause us to incur additional operating losses if we do not realize our expected revenues.\nOur spending is based in significant part on our estimates of future revenue and is largely fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our expectations. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, we anticipate increasing operating expenses to expand program offerings and marketing initiatives. Any such increase could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenues sufficient to cover those expenses.\nIntense competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share, increase our cost of recruiting students and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.\nPostsecondary education is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two- and four-year colleges as well as with other postsecondary schools. Traditional colleges and universities may offer programs similar to those offered by Ashford at lower tuition levels as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to for-profit postsecondary institutions. In addition, Ashford faces continued scrutiny from its accreditors, and some of our competitors, including traditional colleges and universities, have substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business. We may be required to reduce our tuition or increase marketing spending in order to attract or retain students or to pursue new market opportunities. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new marketing relationships with corporations, particularly as corporations become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage or offer scholarships to their employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who generally have significant experience with our company and within the education industry. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and may subsequently compete against us. We do not carry life insurance on our key personnel as part of our benefits. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract, replace and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives or other personnel may cause us or such persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees or other claims.\nIf we are unable to hire new employees or to continue to develop existing employees responsible for student recruitment, the effectiveness of our new enrollment efforts would be adversely affected.\nWe intend to (i) hire, develop and train additional employees responsible for new enrollment and (ii) retain and continue to develop and train our existing new enrollment personnel. Our ability to develop and maintain a strong new enrollment function may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to integrate and motivate our enrollment service advisors, our ability to effectively train our enrollment service advisors, the length of time it takes new enrollment service advisors to become productive, regulatory restrictions on the method of compensating enrollment service advisors and the competition involved in hiring and retaining enrollment service advisors. If we are unable to hire new employees or retain and develop current employees responsible for new enrollment, it could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nEnrollment and revenues could decrease if government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is reduced, suspended or eliminated, if scholarships which we offer to military personnel are reduced or eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 27.4% of Ashford's students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance, including GI Bill benefits, that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. In some cases, we also provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is suspended or otherwise reduced or eliminated, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, if in response to future reductions or suspensions in military tuition assistance we determine to reinstitute our Military Tuition Assistance Grant or a similar program, or if we increase our scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military, our per student revenue from military personnel would decline.\nWe maintain relationships with the military and provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If our relationship with the military deteriorates or we reduce or eliminate these scholarships, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA decline in the overall growth of enrollment in postsecondary institutions, or in the number of students seeking degrees online or in our core disciplines, could cause us to experience a further decline in enrollment at Ashford.\nEnrollment at Ashford declined to 34,722 at December 31, 2019 as compared to 38,153 at December 31, 2018, and our revenues have declined in recent periods and may continue to decline in the future. In addition, if job growth in the fields related to Ashford's core disciplines is weaker than expected, fewer students may seek the types of degrees that Ashford offers. To return to growth in our revenues and increase enrollments, Ashford will need to attract and retain a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand their markets by creating new academic programs. Any further decline in enrollment at Ashford as a result of our inability to attract and retain students in existing markets or expand our markets by creating new academic programs in areas where there is market demand could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on Ashford's ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and to develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nThe updates and expansions of existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or prospective employers of Ashford's graduates. If we do not adequately respond to changes in market requirements by updating and expanding our existing programs or developing new programs, our business will be adversely affected. Even if Ashford is able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, Ashford may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may\nbe conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our operations. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires investments in management, faculty and capital expenditures, additional marketing expenses and reallocation of other resources. Ashford may have limited experience with programs in new disciplines and may need to modify existing systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If Ashford is unable to increase enrollment in new programs, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to keep pace with changing market needs could harm Ashford's ability to attract students.\nOur success depends partially on the willingness of employers to hire, promote or increase the pay of Ashford's graduates. Increasingly, employers demand that their new employees possess appropriate technical and analytical skills, and appropriate interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that Ashford's educational programs continually evolve in response to those economic and technological changes.\nThe expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by prospective employers of Ashford's graduates. Even if Ashford develops acceptable new programs, they may not be able to begin offering those new programs in a timely fashion or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, the rates at which Ashford's graduates obtain jobs in their fields of study could suffer, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently protect our proprietary rights and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of the intellectual property of third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for Ashford, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. Nonetheless, as new challenges arise in protecting these proprietary rights online, we cannot assure you that these measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our technology, curricula and online resource material, among others. Our management's attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to expend funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may also encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights to the content of a course. Third parties may raise claims against us alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid all alleged violations of such intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant, or Ashford may be required to alter the content of their classes to be non-infringing.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances, Ashford's faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel, regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect enrollments.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and if such financing is not available on terms acceptable to us, it could adversely affect our ability to grow.\nWe believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional financing to finance our plans, particularly if we pursue any acquisitions. Additionally, the Company announced that in connection with the Conversion Transaction, the Department indicated it would require AU NFP to post an irrevocable letter of credit with the Department within ten (10) days of the Conversion Transaction for approximately $103 million. The amount, timing and terms of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of new program offerings, the timing and size of acquisitions we may seek to consummate and the amount of cash flows from our operations. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and, consequently, we may not be able to fully implement our plans.\nA protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could lead to lower enrollment and impact our students' ability to repay their loans.\nWe believe that many students pursue postsecondary education to be more competitive in the job market. However, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally. Diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. As a result, enrollments could suffer.\nIn addition, many of Ashford's students borrow Title IV loans to pay for tuition, fees and other expenses. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact their ability to repay those loans which would negatively impact Ashford's cohort default rates. Ashford's students also are frequently able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition. The excess is received by such students as a stipend. However, if a student withdraws, we must return any unearned Title IV funds, including stipends. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students' ability to repay those stipends. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without reimbursement from students could increase, and our results of operations could suffer.\nThe acquisition, integration and growth of acquired businesses may present challenges that could harm our business.\nThe successful integration and profitable operation of an acquired institution or business, including the realization of anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, can present challenges, and the failure to overcome these challenges can have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022distraction of management's attention from normal business operations during the integration process;\n\u2022the inability to attract and/or retain key management personnel to operate the acquired entity;\n\u2022the inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory or other approvals necessary to operate the business;\n\u2022the inability to correctly estimate the size of a target market or accurately assess market dynamics;\n\u2022the inability to retain the clients of the acquired entity;\n\u2022the lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired entity, which also may negatively affect the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022the inability to fully realize the desired efficiencies and economies of scale;\n\u2022expenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAn acquisition related to an institution or other educational business often requires various regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, or we obtain them on unfavorable terms, our ability to consummate a transaction may be impaired or we may be unable to operate the acquired entity in a manner that is favorable to us. If we fail to properly evaluate an acquisition, we may be required to incur costs in excess of what we anticipated, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect Ashford's ability to attract and retain students.\nInterest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if Congress increases interest rates on Title IV loans, or if private loan interest rates rise, Ashford's students would have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to existing and prospective students. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to students' repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact Ashford's eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are involved in pending securities litigation and an adverse resolution of such litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFollowing our announcement that we were restating our interim financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we became the subject of a lawsuit alleging securities law violations. This type of litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome can be difficult to predict regardless of the facts involved. An unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For additional information regarding this and other lawsuits in which we are involved, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nOur financial results may suffer if we fail to successfully implement our restructuring plans and/or cost reduction initiatives aimed at right-sizing our operations to match revenue streams.\nWe have described elsewhere in this Form 10-K our reductions in force which are intended to strengthen our business by right-sizing our operations to match revenue streams. We also described various restructuring charges related to these plans. If we fail to achieve the intended cost savings, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be further impacted. This plan also may have an adverse impact upon the morale or motivation of our employees and may result in further distractions to our management. In addition, management will continue to evaluate our cost structure, and additional restructuring plans may be needed. Any cost-saving measures could impact employee retention. In addition, we cannot be sure that the cost reduction will be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs, or reduced revenue, will not offset any such reductions. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions, either in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., our ability to grow could be impacted and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are one component of our overall long-term growth strategy. The successful implementation of this strategy depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to identify suitable domestic and international acquisition candidates, acquire such businesses on acceptable terms and finance such acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such candidates will be available or, if such candidates are available, that the price will be attractive or that the Company will be able to identify, acquire or finance such businesses successfully. In addition, in pursuing such acquisition opportunities, the Company may compete with other entities with similar growth strategies; these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than the Company. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and/or a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition. There may be particular difficulties and complexities (regulatory or otherwise) associated with our expansion into international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. If we are unable to effectively address these challenges, our ability to execute this component of our long-term strategy will be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022developments regarding the accreditation or state licensing of Ashford;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022public reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022seasonal variations in our student enrollment;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;\n\u2022negative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;\n\u2022changes in enrollment;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. At December 31, 2019, 30.3 million shares of our common stock were outstanding.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, there were 2.0 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and 3.4 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units. All shares subject to outstanding stock options are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable stock option agreement and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Under Rule 144, shares held by non-affiliates for more than six months may generally be sold without restriction, other than a current public information requirement, and may be sold freely without any restrictions after one year. Shares held by affiliates may also be sold under Rule 144 after one year, subject to applicable restrictions, including volume and manner of sale limitations.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely or cease to cover our company, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading\nvolume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and we intend to use our cash position to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nSubject to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), our board of directors (the \u201cboard\u201d) has the authority, without any action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock. At December 31, 2019, there were 300.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, 30.3 million shares of which were outstanding. At December 31, 2019, there were 20.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, no shares of which were outstanding. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce the influence of our current stockholders over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in the rights of our current stockholders being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nOur common stock has relatively low trading volume, compared to many other public companies\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ. Our average daily trading volume over these various mediums is relatively low, particularly when compared to many larger public companies. This low trading volume can cause our common stock price to fluctuate significantly, and can make it difficult for investors to buy or sell our common stock quickly and efficiently, compared to companies with a larger publicly traded float and higher average daily trading volumes.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by our board to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022provide for a classified board (three classes);\n\u2022provide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022provide that any vacancy on our board, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022provide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board or by our chief executive officer;\n\u2022provide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board first approves such action, whenever the vote of stockholders is required at a meeting for any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action may be taken without such meeting and vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NASDAQ rules for so long as our shares are listed on the NASDAQ, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;\n\u2022provide that the board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.", "PERMNO": 92902, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ZVO"}
