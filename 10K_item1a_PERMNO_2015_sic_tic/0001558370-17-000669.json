Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in the documents incorporated by reference herein before making an investment decision. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could cause you to suffer a partial or complete loss of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially harm our business and operations. See \u201cCautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students.\nAs a provider of higher education, we are subject to extensive regulation on both the federal and state levels. In particular, the Higher Education Act and related regulations subject Strayer University and all other higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs to significant regulatory scrutiny.\nThe Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the Department of Education; (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary of Education; and (3) state education regulatory bodies. In addition, other federal agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Trade Commission, and various state agencies and state Attorneys General enforce consumer protection laws applicable to post-secondary educational institutions.\nThe regulations, standards and policies of these regulatory agencies frequently change, and changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV programs or costs of doing business.\nTitle IV requirements are enforced by the Department of Education and in some instances by private plaintiffs. If we are found to be in noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards or policies, we could lose our access to Title IV program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Findings of noncompliance also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages, or being subjected to fines, penalties, injunctions, restrictions on our access to Title IV program funds or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s gainful employment regulations could result in heightened disclosure requirements and loss of Title IV eligibility.\nTo be eligible for Title IV funding, academic programs offered by proprietary institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published the final regulations on gainful employment, generally, effective July 1, 2015. The regulations include two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual income rate measures student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measures student debt in relation to discretionary income. A program passes if the program\u2019s graduates:\n\u00b7\nHave an annual income rate that does not exceed 8%; or\n\u00b7\nHave a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.\nA program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics, and that has an annual income rate between 8% and 12%, or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30%, is considered to be in a warning zone. A program fails if the program\u2019s graduates have an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program would become Title IV-ineligible for three years if it failed both metrics for two out of three consecutive\nyears, or fails to pass at least one metric for four consecutive award years. The regulations provide a means by which an institution may challenge the Department of Education\u2019s calculation of any of the debt metrics prior to loss of Title IV eligibility.\nThe requirements associated with the gainful employment regulations may substantially increase our administrative burdens and could affect our program offerings, student enrollment, persistence and retention. Further, although the regulations provide opportunities for an institution to correct any potential deficiencies in a program prior to the loss of Title IV eligibility, the continuing eligibility of our academic programs will be affected by factors beyond management\u2019s control such as changes in our graduates\u2019 employment and income levels, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, and various other factors. Even if we were able to correct any deficiency in the gainful employment metrics in a timely manner, the disclosure requirements associated with a program\u2019s failure to meet at least one metric may adversely affect student enrollments in that program and may adversely affect the reputation of our institution.\nCongressional examination of for-profit post-secondary education could lead to legislation or other governmental action that may negatively affect the industry.\nSince 2010, Congress has increased its focus on for-profit higher education institutions, including regarding participation in Title IV programs and oversight by the Department of Defense of tuition assistance for military service members attending for-profit colleges. The Senate HELP Committee and other congressional committees have held hearings into, among other things, the proprietary education sector and its participation in Title IV programs, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, credit hours and program length, the portion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions, and the receipt of veterans and military education benefits by students enrolled at proprietary institutions. Strayer University has cooperated with these inquiries. A number of legislators have variously requested the Government Accountability Office to review and make recommendations regarding, among other things, recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud and abuse in Title IV programs, and the percentage of proprietary institutions\u2019 revenue coming from Title IV and other federal funding sources.\nThis activity may result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting participation in Title IV programs, and other governmental actions. In addition, concerns generated by congressional activity may adversely affect enrollment in and revenues of for-profit educational institutions. Limitations on the amount of federal student financial aid for which our students are eligible under Title IV could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on the renewal and maintenance of Title IV programs.\nThe Higher Education Act, which is the law authorizing Title IV programs, is subject to periodic reauthorization. Congress completed the most recent reauthorization through multiple pieces of legislation and may reauthorize the HEA in a piecemeal manner in the future. Additionally, Congress determines the funding level for each Title IV program on an annual basis. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV programs or the ability of our school or students to participate in these programs could materially harm our business. A reduction in government funding levels could lead to lower enrollments at our school and require us to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students. Lower student enrollments or our inability to arrange such alternative sources of funding could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to compliance reviews, which, if they resulted in a material finding of noncompliance, could affect our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and related lawsuits by government agencies, accrediting agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, the Department of Education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in Title IV programs, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. The Department of Education could limit, suspend, or terminate our participation in Title IV programs or impose other penalties such as requiring us to make refunds, pay liabilities, or pay an administrative fine upon a material finding of noncompliance.\nThe Department of Education conducted four campus-based program reviews of Strayer University\u2019s administration of Title IV programs in three states and the District of Columbia, with one on-site review conducted August 18-20, 2014; one on-site review conducted September 8-11, 2014; and two on-site reviews conducted September 22-26, 2014. On October 21, 2014, the Department of Education issued an Expedited Final Program Review Determination Letter for one of the program reviews conducted the week of September 22, 2014, closing the program review with no further action required by us. On November 17, 2014, we received a Program Review Report for the program review conducted in August 2014, and provided a response to the Department of Education on December 15, 2014. On January 7, 2015, we received a Final Program Review Determination letter from that August 2014 review, closing the program review with no further action required by us. On March 24, 2015, the Company received a Program Review Report for another program review, and provided a response to the Department on April 21, 2015. On April 29, 2015, the Company received a Final Program Review Determination Letter closing the review and identifying a payment of less than $500 due to the Department of Education based on an underpayment on a return to Title IV calculation. The Company remitted payment, and received a letter from the Department on May 26, 2015, indicating that no further action was required and that the matter was closed. On September 15, 2015, the Company received a Program Review Report for the final program review, and provided a response to the Department on October 5, 2015. On January 5, 2016, the Company received a Final Program Review Determination Letter for the final program review, indicating that the program review was closed and no further action was required.\nOn August 21, 2014, the Department of Education notified Strayer University that its Program Participation Agreement was approved on a provisional basis because of the Department of Education\u2019s program reviews open at the time of issuance. On October 1, 2014, we received a fully executed provisional Program Participation Agreement which allows us to continue to administer Title IV aid through June 30, 2017, subject to the condition that Strayer University must obtain the Department of Education\u2019s approval for substantial changes, including the addition of any new location, level of academic offering, or non-degree and degree programs. Strayer University must apply to the Department of Education for recertification to participate in Title IV programs on or before March 31, 2017, and intends to do so in a timely manner.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by the Department of Education, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nThe loss of Strayer University\u2019s accreditation by Middle States or Middle States\u2019 loss of recognition by the Department of Education would render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, an adverse action by Middle States other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In November 2015, the Department of Education announced a set of executive actions and legislative proposals to increase transparency and rigor in accreditation. On January 20, 2016, the Department of Education issued additional recommendations related to accreditation. On September 22, 2016, the Department of Education rescinded its recognition of the Accreditation Council of Independent Colleges and Schools. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by the Secretary of Education in connection with the Department of Education\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other adverse consequences.\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs there.\nEach Strayer University campus is authorized to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates by the applicable education agency or agencies of the state where the campus is located. Such state authorization is required for students at the campus to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs at least at those state campus locations, limit Strayer University\u2019s ability to operate in that state and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEffective July 1, 2011, Department of Education regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure\nrequirements consistent with the new rules. If a state in which Strayer has a physical campus fails to comply in the future with the provisions of the new rule or fails to provide the University with legal authorization, it could limit Strayer University\u2019s ability to operate in that state and have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Education published final regulations addressing, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. The final regulations, which are effective July 1, 2018, require an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. An institution could obtain such authorization directly from the state or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement. If one of our institutions fails to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide post-secondary distance education in a specific state, the institution could lose its ability to award Title IV aid to online students in that state and could lose its ability to provide distance education in that state.\nStrayer University participates in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), which allows the University to enroll students in distance education programs in each SARA member state. Strayer University applies separately to non-SARA member states for authorization to enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state. If Strayer University failed to comply with the requirements to participate in SARA or state licensing or authorization requirements to provide distance education in a non-SARA state, the University could lose its ability to participate in SARA or may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education in that non-SARA state, respectively.\nIf we fail to obtain recertification by the Department of Education when required, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution generally must seek recertification from the Department of Education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. The Department of Education may also review an institution\u2019s continued eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways, such as the addition of certain types of new programs, or, in certain cases, changes to the academic credentials that it offers. In certain circumstances, the Department of Education must provisionally certify an institution. The Department of Education may withdraw our certification if it determines that we are not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in Title IV programs. If the Department of Education does not renew, or withdraws our certification to participate in Title IV programs, our students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEach institution participating in Title IV programs must enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education. Under the agreement, the institution agrees to follow the Department of Education\u2019s rules and regulations governing Title IV programs. On October 1, 2014, Strayer University received an executed provisional Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education allowing it to participate in Title IV programs until June 30, 2017. The Program Participation Agreement was issued on a provisional basis because of the Department of Education\u2019s program reviews open at the time of issuance. Under the provisional agreement, the only material additional condition that the University must comply with is obtaining Department of Education approval for substantial changes, including the addition of any new location, level of academic offering, or non-degree and degree programs. Strayer University must apply to the Department of Education for recertification to participate in Title IV programs on or before March 31, 2017, and intends to do so in a timely manner\nA failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education, including, among other things, certain standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability. If we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility or maintain administrative capability under the Department of Education\u2019s\nregulations, we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nStudent loan defaults could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn general, under the Higher Education Act, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the second federal fiscal year following that fiscal year. Institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 15% for any of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available are subject to a 30-day delayed disbursement period for first-year, first-time borrowers. While its cohort default rate for 2011 was 14.9%, Strayer University voluntarily delays disbursement of Direct Loans in this manner. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if its default rate for a federal fiscal year was greater than 40%.\nIf we lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. Strayer University\u2019s three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013, were 14.9%, 11.6%, and 11.3%, respectively. The average official cohort default rates for proprietary institutions nationally were 19.1%,15.8%, and 15.0% for federal fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.\nStrayer University could lose its eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or be provisionally certified with respect to such participation if the percentage of our revenues derived from those programs were too high.\nA proprietary institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the federal Title IV student financial aid program if it derives more than 90% of its revenues, on a cash basis, from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years. A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional status for up to two fiscal years. Using the formula specified in the Higher Education Act, we derived approximately 74% of our cash-basis revenues from these programs in 2015. Certain members of Congress have proposed to revise the 90/10 Rule to count tuition assistance provided by the Department of Defense and veterans education benefits, along with Title IV revenue, toward the 90% limit and to reduce the limit to 85% of total revenue. Such proposals could make it difficult for us to comply with the 90/10 rule. If we were to violate the 90/10 Rule, the loss of eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s incentive compensation rules could result in sanctions and other liability.\nIf we pay a bonus, commission or other incentive payment in violation of applicable Department of Education rules or if the Department of Education or other third parties interpret our compensation practices as such, we could be subject to sanctions or other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s misrepresentation rules could result in sanctions and other liability.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution that participates in Title IV programs from engaging in \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Department of Education\u2019s Program Integrity Regulations, which took effect July 1, 2011, interpret this provision to prohibit any statement on those topics, made by the institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution, that has the likelihood or tendency to confuse. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held on June 5, 2012, that the term \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d could not include true, nondeceitful statements that are merely confusing. The misrepresentation rules are scheduled to expand on July 1, 2017 to include \u201cany statement that has the likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances.\u201d The definition would also expand to include \u201cany statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading.\u201d On January 30, 2017, the new Administration indicated in\na notice published in the Federal Register that it intends to take action in relation to the regulation establishing a new definition of misrepresentation, but it is unclear what that action will be or when it will be taken.\nIn the event of substantial misrepresentation, the Department of Education may revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement, limit the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution such as to add new programs or locations, initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If the Department of Education or other third parties interpret statements made by us or on our behalf to be in violation of the new regulations, we could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s credit hour rule could result in sanctions and other liability.\nEffective July 1, 2011, Title IV regulations define the term \u201ccredit hour\u201d and require accrediting agencies and state authorization agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution\u2019s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by the Department of Education could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution\u2019s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If the Department of Education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the Department of Education could impose liabilities or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 could result in sanctions and other liability.\nStrayer University must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (\u201cClery Act\u201d) including changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. On October 20, 2014, the Department of Education promulgated final regulations implementing amendments to the Clery Act. In addition, the Department of Education has interpreted Title IX to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination and to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure to comply with the Clery Act or Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department of Education to require corrective action, fine the University or limit or suspend its participation in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, and could harm the University\u2019s reputation.\nWe are subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nThe Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations require us to calculate refunds of unearned Title IV program funds disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational program before completing it. If refunds are not properly calculated or timely paid, we may be required to post a letter of credit with the Department of Education or be subject to sanctions or other adverse actions by the Department of Education, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInvestigations, legislative and regulatory developments and general credit market conditions related to the student loan industry may result in fewer lenders and loan products and increased regulatory burdens and costs.\nThe Higher Education Act regulates relationships between lenders to students and post-secondary education institutions. In 2009, the Department of Education promulgated regulations that address these relationships, and state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions. In addition, new procedures introduced and recommendations made by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau create uncertainty about whether Congress will impose new burdens on private student lenders. These developments, as well as legislative and regulatory changes such as those relating to gainful employment and repayment rates, creating uncertainty in the industry and general credit market conditions, may cause some lenders to decide not to provide certain loan products and may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs. Such actions could reduce demand for\nand/or availability of private education loans, decrease Strayer University\u2019s non-Title IV revenue and thereby increase Strayer University\u2019s 90/10 ratio and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on one or more third parties for software and services necessary to administer our participation in Title IV programs and failure of such a third party to provide compliant software and services, or by us in our use of the software, could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nBecause Strayer University is jointly and severally liable to the Department of Education for the actions of third-party Title IV processing software providers, failure of such providers to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on Strayer University, including loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If any of the third-party providers discontinue providing software and services to us, we may not be able to replace them in a timely, cost-efficient, or effective manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of Title IV programs, which could adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed if we experience a disruption in our ability to process student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program.\nWe collected the majority of our fiscal year 2016 total consolidated net revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds, principally from federal student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program. Any processing disruptions by the Department of Education may affect our students\u2019 ability to obtain student loans on a timely basis. If we experience a disruption in our ability to process student loans through the Federal Direct Loan Program, either because of administrative challenges on our part or the inability of the Department of Education to process the volume of direct loans on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely and materially affected.\nOur business could be harmed if Congress makes changes to the availability of Title IV funds.\nWe collected the majority of our fiscal year 2016 total consolidated net revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds, principally from federal student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program. Changes in the availability of these funds or a reduction in the amount of funds disbursed may have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Congress eliminated further federal direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students as of July 1, 2012. On August 9, 2013, Congress passed legislation that ties interest rates on Title IV loans to the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bonds. Interest rates are set every July 1st for loans taken out from July 1st to June 30th of the following year. In April 2011, Congress eliminated year-round Pell Grant awards beginning with the 2011-2012 award year and in July 2012, Congress reduced eligibility for Pell Grants from 18 semesters to 12 semesters. To date, these changes have not had a material impact on our business, but future changes in the availability of Title IV funds could impact students\u2019 ability to fund their education and thus may have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur enrollment rate is uncertain, and we may not be able to assess our future enrollments effectively.\nOur growth depends on a number of factors, including increased unemployment and the resulting lower confidence in job prospects, and many of the regulatory risks discussed above. In 2011, we revised our business model to acknowledge lower growth or reductions in enrollments. Our enrollment in 2017 will be affected by legislative uncertainty, regulatory activity, and market conditions. Until legislative, regulatory, and market uncertainties are resolved, it may be difficult to assess whether and to what extent there is an impact on our long-term growth prospects. In 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, we closed physical locations to better align our resources with our current student enrollments. Although we may continue to invest in new campuses and to pursue our strategic goals in the future, there can be no assurance as to what our growth rate will be or as to the steps we may need to take if regulatory and legislative matters are not clarified or if market conditions do not stabilize.\nAdding new locations, programs and services is dependent on our forecast of the demand for those locations, programs and services and on regulatory approvals.\nAdding new locations, programs and services require us to expend significant resources, including making human capital and financial capital investments, incurring marketing expenses and reallocating other resources. To open a new location, we are required to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. We cannot assure investors that we will open new locations or add new programs or services in the future.\nOur future success depends in part upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel.\nOur success to date has been, and our continuing success will be, substantially dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers, faculty and administrators and other key personnel. If we cease to employ any of these integral personnel or fail to manage a smooth transition to new personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of existing academic programs and develop new programs in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of our academic programs, develop new programs in a cost-effective manner and meet students\u2019 needs in a timely manner. Prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technological and other skills. The update and expansion of our existing programs and the development of new programs may not be received favorably by students, prospective employers or the online education market. If we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require due to regulatory constraints or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing new programs.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop awareness of the academic programs we offer among working adult students.\nThe continued development of awareness of the academic programs we offer among working adult students is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our programs. If we are unable to continue to develop awareness of the programs we offer, this could limit our enrollments and negatively impact our business. The following are some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our programs:\n\u00b7\nthe emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u00b7\ncustomer dissatisfaction with our services and programs;\n\u00b7\nperformance problems with our online systems; and\n\u00b7\nour failure to maintain or expand our brand or other factors related to our marketing.\nCongressional and other governmental activities could damage the reputation of Strayer University and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nIn the last seven years, Congress increased its focus on proprietary educational institutions, including administration of Title IV programs, military assistance programs, and other federal programs. The Department of Education indicated to Congress that it intended to increase its regulation of and attention to proprietary educational institutions, and the Government Accountability Office released several reports of investigations into proprietary educational institutions. In 2014, the Department of Education announced the creation of an interagency task force to oversee proprietary educational institutions by coordinating the activities of several agencies and promote information sharing among the agencies, which include the Department of Justice, VA, the CFPB, the FTC, and the SEC as well as state attorneys general. These and other governmental activities, including new regulations on program integrity and gainful employment, even if resulting in no adverse findings or actions against Strayer University, singly or cumulatively could affect public perception of proprietary higher education, damage the reputation of Strayer University, and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe face strong competition in the post-secondary education market.\nPost-secondary education in the United States is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges, other for-profit schools and alternatives to higher education, such as employment and military service. Public colleges may offer programs similar to those of Strayer University at a lower tuition level as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Congress, the Department of Education, and other agencies have required increasing disclosure of information to consumers. While we believe that Strayer University provides valuable education to its students, we cannot predict the bases on which individual students and potential students will choose among the range of educational and other options available to them. This strong competition could adversely affect our business.\nStrayer relies on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property, and competitors may attempt to duplicate our programs and methods.\nThird parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online library, quality management and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret or other protections. Such intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, courseware materials for classes taught online and on-ground, and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of its various education regulatory agencies.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. This fluctuation may result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We experience, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue. Historically, our quarterly revenues and income have been lowest in the third quarter (July through September) because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. We also incur significant expenses in the third quarter in preparing for our peak enrollment in the fourth quarter (October through December), including investing in online and campus infrastructure necessary to support increased usage. These investments result in fluctuations in our operating results which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the online education market is a rapidly evolving market, and we may not be able to forecast accurately future enrollment growth and revenues.\nRegulatory requirements may make it more difficult to acquire us.\nA change in ownership resulting in a change of control of Strayer University would trigger a requirement for recertification of Strayer University by the Department of Education for purposes of participation in federal student financial aid programs, a review of Strayer University\u2019s accreditation by Middle States and reauthorization of Strayer University by certain state licensing and other regulatory agencies. If we underwent a change of control that required approval by any state authority, Middle States or any federal agency, and any required regulatory approval were significantly delayed, limited or denied, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to offer certain educational programs, award certain degrees, diplomas or certificates, operate one or more of our locations, admit certain students or participate in Title IV programs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. These factors may discourage takeover attempts.\nCapacity constraints or system disruptions to Strayer University\u2019s computer networks could damage the reputation of Strayer University and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of Strayer University\u2019s computer networks, especially the online educational platform, is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic, could result in the unavailability of Strayer University\u2019s computer networks. We\ncannot assure you that Strayer University, including its online educational platform, will be able to expand its program infrastructure on a timely basis sufficient to meet demand for its programs. Strayer University\u2019s computer systems and operations could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond its control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures. Any interruption to Strayer University\u2019s computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nStrayer University\u2019s computer networks may be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations and require it to expend significant resources.\nStrayer University\u2019s computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. As a result, Strayer University may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subject us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot assure you that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nStrayer University, with its online programs, operates in a highly competitive market with rapid technological changes and it may not compete successfully.\nOnline education is a highly fragmented and competitive market that is subject to rapid technological change. Competitors vary in size and organization from traditional colleges and universities, many of which have some form of online education programs, to for-profit schools, corporate universities and software companies providing online education and training software. We expect the online education and training market to be subject to rapid changes in technologies. Strayer University\u2019s success will depend on its ability to adapt to these changing technologies.\nWe may not be able to complete or integrate any future acquisitions successfully.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we expect to consider selective acquisitions. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to complete successfully any acquisitions on favorable terms, or that if we do, we will be able to integrate successfully the personnel, operations and technologies of any such acquisitions. Our failure to complete or integrate successfully future acquisitions could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our profitability and liquidity by distracting our management and employees and increasing our expenses. In addition, because an acquisition is considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards, we must seek approval from the Department of Education if the acquired institution participates in Title IV programs, and most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies and possibly other regulatory bodies when we acquire an institution. If we were unable to obtain such approvals of an institution we acquired, depending on the size of that acquisition, that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 83799, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "STRA"}
