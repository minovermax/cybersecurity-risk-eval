{"cik": "924805", "company": "Freedom Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below are those that we currently consider material, and the statements contained elsewhere in this annual report, including our financial statements, should be read together with these risk factors. The occurrence of any of, or a combination of, the following risks or uncertainties, or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, or reputation.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the principal risks that could affect our businesses and should be read with the more complete discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth below it.\nRisks Related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict:\n\u2022Our business and operations have been materially adversely affected by the ongoing Russia/Ukraine Conflict.\n\u2022Economic sanctions related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\u2022Non-compliance with U.S., UK, EU, Russian or other sanctions programs could adversely impact our company.\n\u2022The Russia/Ukraine Conflict and sanctions could adversely affect our client base and revenues.\n\u2022The Russia/Ukraine Conflict has and may continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\u2022We expect to experience contraction of our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industries:\n\u2022We operate in highly regulated industries.\n\u2022As a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq we have substantial regulatory reporting obligations.\n\u2022We are subject to risks related to anti-corruption laws in effect in the United States and the non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business.\n\u2022The countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\n\u2022Our relatively limited operational history has coincided with sustained market growth which may not be predictive of future operating results.\n\u2022Increased competition in the markets in which we operate may result in a decrease in our market share and/or profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Banking Business Activities:\n\u2022Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the financial condition and operations of our subsidiaries.\n\u2022We may suffer significant losses from credit exposures.\n\u2022Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\n\u2022Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our business, liquidity and cost of funding.\n\u2022Our investments can expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\n\u2022We may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available or available on attractive terms.\n\u2022We are dependent upon our relationships with third party U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit securities and funds internationally.\n\u2022We rely on our relationship with FFIN Brokerage for a significant percentage of our revenue, and as a result of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict the future prospects of FFIN Brokerage are uncertain.\n\u2022We may suffer significant loss from changes in the KASE's requirements related to the discount coefficients on the securities in securities repurchase transactions.\n\u2022Our measures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanction violations may not be completely effective.\nRisks Related to our Business in Emerging Markets:\n\u2022Emerging markets, such as many of the markets in which we operate, are subject to greater risks than more mature markets, including significant political, economic and legal risks.\n\u2022We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.\n\u2022We face interest rate change risks.\n\u2022The economies of Kazakhstan and other countries in which we operate are vulnerable to external shocks and fluctuations in the global economy.\n\u2022Kazakhstan's economy is vulnerable to internal social/political unrest.\n\u2022Economic and political instability in the Russian Federation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nTaxation Risks Related to our International Operations:\n\u2022Global anti-offshore measures could adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Frequent tax law changes in the regions where we conduct operations could affect our business in and the value of our investments.\n\u2022Russian transfer pricing legislation may require pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities.\n\u2022Russian anti-offshore measures expose us to tax liability risks.\n\u2022Uncertainties and ongoing changes in Kazakhstan's tax regime may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022Changes in regulations related to taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions could reduce the volume of market transactions and impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Internal Operations:\n\u2022We are in process of restructuring the ownership of our subsidiaries and undergoing a related corporate restructuring, and the approval, completion and consequences of these plans cannot be assured.\n\u2022As a diversified holding company with few operations of our own we are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund holding company operations.\n\u2022As a \"controlled company\" under Nasdaq rules, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that may adversely affect our stock price.\n\u2022The interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with those of other shareholders.\n\u2022Civil liability may be difficult or impossible to enforce against us.\n\u2022We are dependent on our executive management team, particularly Timur Turlov, and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel.\n\u2022We may not be able to properly manage our growth.\n\u2022We anticipate that acquisitions will continue to play a key role in our growth strategy, but we may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security:\n\u2022Our broker-dealer, financial services, and banking operations are highly dependent on the continued and proper functioning of our information technology systems.\n\u2022We interact with large volumes of sensitive data that exposes us to IT breach and other data security risks and liabilities.\n\u2022The infrastructure on which our IT systems depend is subject to events that could interrupt our ability to operate.\n\u2022Failure of third-party systems and operations on which we rely could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022To remain competitive, we must keep pace with rapid technological change.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities:\n\u2022The price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may be volatile.\n\u2022Future offerings of securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, our stockholders' ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Business Risks:\n\u2022We are subject to risks of litigation, and administrative and regulatory action arising from our operating activities.\n\u2022Extraordinary events beyond our control could negatively impact our business.\n\u2022The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and the ongoing endemic might continue to impact the global economy, global financial markets and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict\nOur business and operations have been materially adversely affected by the ongoing Russia/Ukraine Conflict.\nWe have significant operations in Russia. The ongoing Russia/Ukraine Conflict, and the responses of governments and multinational businesses to it, have created critical challenges for our business and operations, both in Russia and globally. These factors, including the specific risks outlined below, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and trading price.\nEconomic sanctions related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nIn connection with the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, broad-based sanctions (including asset-freeze/blocking sanctions) have been imposed by the U.S., UK, EU, and numerous other governments targeting Russia, including but not limited to major Russian banks, the CBR, certain other Russian companies, Russian parliament members and certain members of the Russian elite and their families. Select Russian banks have also been disconnected from the SWIFT financial transfers system. The sanctions have also banned primary and/or secondary trading of Russian sovereign debt and selected other securities of Russian issuers. In addition, many private businesses are taking a cautious approach to sanctions compliance and have adopted policies more restrictive than are strictly required by the applicable rules. A number of international businesses are taking a conservative approach and are restricting or eliminating their business with and supply to any parties in Russia at this time. It is possible that additional sanctions may be imposed, which may include additional or new asset-freezing/blocking sanctions of Russian individuals (SDNs) or Russian companies (including other systemically important companies and banks), a prohibition on the conversion of RUB into USD, EUR or GBP, and the disconnection of additional Russian banks from the SWIFT financial transfers system. The multinational sanctions may be expanded to include additional persons and sectors of the Russian economy.\nIn response to international sanctions, Russia has issued countersanctions against \u201cunfriendly states\u201d (i.e., countries imposing sanctions on Russia). Although neither FRHC nor any of its group companies is a target of sanctions, these restrictions and policies may limit the ability of certain of our businesses to enter into agreements with international parties and may make it more difficult for us to enter into agreements with other counterparties, who may refuse to work with us because of the geopolitical situation.\nExamples of additional sanctions measures that could affect our business include:\n\u2022sanctions directly targeting one or more of our subsidiaries, board members, or senior executives;\n\u2022expanding the scope of sanctioned activities or transactions;\n\u2022designating parties with whom we have or may have significant business relationships as \u201cspecially designated nationals\u201d or \u201cblocked\u201d parties, meaning that all dealings with them by the U.S., UK and/or EU persons, or persons from other countries which impose economic sanctions, or involving items or technologies from these jurisdictions would be prohibited;\n\u2022expanding sanctions to cover entities that are less than 50% owned or controlled by a sanctioned party; or\n\u2022adopting corporate policies that prohibit or restrict business activities with us because we conduct business with Russian persons not subject to any sanctions.\nIn addition, should there be a large scale expansion of Russia-related sanctions by the U.S. to make them applicable to private sector financial institutions in Russia or to Russia\u2019s banking system generally, this could negatively affect our Russian subsidiaries by limiting or prohibiting their access to the U.S. financial system or financial markets. A large scale expansion of Russia-related sanctions by the United States or other countries or regions may also negatively affect the Russian economy and investment climate, and cause deterioration of the Russian financial markets. The impact of any such expansion would depend on the nature of such sanctions. While we have decided to divest our interest in our Russian subsidiaries, the timing of such divestiture is uncertain and is subject to factors beyond our control.\nUntil the planned divestiture is completed, our Russian subsidiaries will continue to be subject to material risks in relation to the sanctions discussed above.\nNon-compliance with U.S., UK, EU, Russian or other sanctions programs could adversely impact our company.\nWe are committed to compliance with all applicable economic sanctions, including those related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict.\nU.S. economic sanctions include prohibitions (\u201cprimary\u201d sanctions) that are generally administered and enforced by OFAC. With the exception of OFAC\u2019s Iran and Cuba sanctions programs these prohibitions apply to U.S. Persons, including companies organized under the laws of the United States and their overseas branches, but do not apply to non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. Persons. U.S. economic sanctions also include \u201csecondary\u201d sanctions that make certain activities of non-U.S. companies sanctionable under U.S. statutes such as the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (\u201cCAATSA\u201d). These sanctions are administered by OFAC and/or the U.S. Department of State. The Company requires its subsidiaries to fully comply with all U.S. primary sanctions that are applicable to such subsidiaries and/or to transactions in which they are involved and to refrain from participation in any conduct that is sanctionable under U.S. secondary sanctions.\nBecause we are a U.S. domiciled holding company that operates through our subsidiaries, we are obliged to comply with Ukraine/Russia-related sanctions imposed by the U.State., but those sanctions do not apply to the fully independent activities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries where there is no U.S. nexus. If, however, it were determined that we facilitated activities of our subsidiaries that are prohibited under U.S. sanctions our U.S. holding company could be subject to civil or criminal penalties under OFAC regulations. In addition, non-U.S. companies that cause U.S. companies to violate OFAC regulations may be subject to enforcement action and thereby the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. This could occur, for example, if one of our subsidiaries were to process a U.S dollar transaction involving sanctioned securities through the U.S. financial system. The risk of noncompliance may arise in connection with international transactions conducted in U.S. dollars, transfers to or from U.S. bank accounts, or dealings with U.S. broker-dealers.\nIn the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused us or any of our subsidiaries to violate applicable economic sanctions laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which could be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and cause significant brand or reputational damage.\nSanctions are subject to rapid change and it is also possible that new direct or indirect secondary sanctions could be imposed by the U.S. or other jurisdictions without warning in relation to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict. The extent of current sanctions measures, not all of which are fully aligned across jurisdictions, further increases operational complexity for our business and increases the risk of making errors in managing day-to-day business activities within the rapidly evolving sanctions environment.\nNew multinational sanctions as well as countersanctions by the Russian government could also result in differences between the local application and/or implementation of relevant requirements in our planned divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries and related corporate restructuring (as we are required to adhere to local law).\nWe are monitoring closely the developing sanctions environment, including Russian countersanctions, and utilizing dedicated corporate governance structures and in-house and outside advisors as and when required to ensure our continued compliance. However, we cannot assure that we can remain in compliance with all sanctions and countersanctions.\nThe Russia/Ukraine Conflict and sanctions could adversely affect our client base and revenues.\nHistorically, a large portion of our trading volume has been derived from individuals and qualifying institutions in Russia, through foreign accounts, including accounts held with FFIN Brokerage. Although we are divesting our Russian subsidiaries, we anticipate that we will continue to generate fee and commission income from trading activity originated by Russians not subject to any sanctions prohibitions or other legal restrictions through their foreign accounts.\nThe current geopolitical crisis and responses to it have materially and adversely impacted the macroeconomic climate in Russia and the surrounding region, resulting in significant currency rate volatility, the imposition of currency controls, capital flight, materially increased interest rates and inflation, and the withdrawal of or reduction of business by a number of Western businesses from the Russian market, which may lead to reduced investment confidence and investment spending by affected Russians. Further, there is a risk that new international sanctions and new countersanctions measures may curtail the ability of our Russian investors to trade through foreign accounts or in foreign securities, or our ability to facilitate any trading through our non-Russian subsidiaries or FFIN Brokerage. If investment spending by Russian holders of foreign trading accounts occurs, it would result in material reductions in our revenues.\nThe Russia/Ukraine Conflict has and may continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn quarter four of our 2022 fiscal year, coinciding with the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, we had negative trends in certain of our operating results. For example, we had a net loss of $38.6 million on foreign exchange operations. We attribute this loss to the decline in the value of the Russian ruble and Kazakhstan tenge against the U.S. Dollar during the quarter in connection with the Russia/Ukraine Conflict and its geopolitical consequences. Further, during our fourth fiscal quarter 2022, we recognized a decrease in net gain on trading securities of $107,883 as a result of revaluation of securities in our proprietary investment accounts, which we ultimately attribute to effects stemming from the Conflict.\nWhile the Russian ruble and Kazakhstan tenge have strengthened since the end of our fourth quarter 2022, there is no assurance that this trend will continue and we do not know what future macroeconomic effects the Russia/Ukraine Conflict will have on currencies and the resulting effects on our financial results.\nMore generally, the impact of the Conflict on us, from both a financial and non-financial risk perspective will depend on future developments. The Conflict may have significant negative economic consequences not only for the Russian economy but also for other countries and regions including Europe and the U.S. In particular, the Conflict has the potential to continue impacting the already stressed energy price situation in Europe and the U.S. which could lead to inflationary pressures and economic slowdown which would adversely affect our brokerage business and the revenue we derive from it.\nWe expect to experience contraction of our business operations.\nHistorically we have experienced significant growth. However, in light of the ongoing effect of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, and potential collateral impacts, we could experience a contraction of our business. In addition, following our planned divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries, we will no longer generate revenues from Russia and the scale of our operations will contract significantly. As of March 31, 2022, our Russian subsidiaries had 43 offices and branches and 1,717 employees.We cannot assure that our historical growth patterns or recent and planned acquisitions will offset potential declines. In addition, there can be no assurance that our management and key employees will successfully manage business contraction. For additional information regarding the financial results of our Russian subsidiaries see \"Planned Divestiture of our Russian Subsidiaries\" in \"MD&A\" in Part II, Item 7.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industries\nWe operate in highly regulated industries.\nOur business, through our various subsidiaries, is subject to extensive government regulation, licensing and oversight in multiple jurisdictions. This includes but is not limited to laws, regulations and rules or other obligations concerning securities brokerage, securities trading, investment banking, commercial banking, credit, deposit taking, margin lending, foreign currency exchange, privacy, cross-border and domestic money transmission, sanctions, cyber security, data governance, fraud detection, data protection, antitrust and competition, banking secrecy, consumer protection, payment services (including payment anti-money laundering processing and settlement services), counter-terrorist financing and economic and trade sanctions. For example, our subsidiary Freedom KZ is qualified as both a banking holding company and an insurance holding company, subjecting it to banking and insurance regulations in Kazakhstan.\nAs we introduce new products and services and expand existing product and service offerings we may be subjected to additional regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements and related regulatory oversight.\nFurther, the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate may impose different or even conflicting obligations than those applicable to us or our other subsidiaries or any of our affiliates. For example, laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies used by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations, as well as broader liability.\nIn addition, certain transactions that may be prohibited by economic sanctions regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") if undertaken by us or in the United States may be permissible if undertaken independently by a non-U.S. subsidiary where there is no U.S. nexus. Also, our Kazakhstan brokerage operates in the regulatory frameworks of both Kazakhstan and the Astana International Financial Centre (\"AIFC\"). Governing law of the AIFC is based on principles of English law, where Kazakhstan legislation is civil law. Civil law is very different from English law. Operation in these two essentially different frameworks exposes our Kazakhstan brokerage to additional regulatory risks and periodically raises conflicts of regulations when Kazakhstan's laws conflict with AIFC regulations. Neither the Kazakhstan nor AIFC authorities have yet provided any clarification on the matter. These inconsistencies may potentially result in disputes and liability.\nU.S. sanctions and all non-U.S. sanction regimes, anti-money laundering (AML) and other compliance matters represent regulatory compliance risk for us. A failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders of any cognizant government authority may subject us, our subsidiaries or any of our affiliates to investigation, which may involve extensive legal-related costs. A finding of noncompliance could result in criminal or civil enforcement in one or more jurisdictions leading to significant fines or penalties, including forfeiture of assets; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; result in loss of existing licenses or prevent or delay obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny; restrict our operations, require that we change certain business practices, or make product or operational changes; increase expenses; and delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding these measures, it is possible that our employees, contractors, and agents could nevertheless breach such laws and regulations. We may be subject to legal claims from our customers and counterparties, as well as regulatory actions brought against us by the regulators, self-regulatory agencies and supervisory authorities that oversee and regulate the industries in which we operate. From time to time, we have been, and in the future may be subject to investigations, regulatory proceedings, fines and penalties brought by regulators. We may be subject to employment-related claims and disputes with taxing authorities and other claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and economic and trade sanctions.\nDue to facts that we collect personal information of our customers and have a presence in a number of countries, we are also subject to data protection laws in various jurisdictions, which may require significant compliance efforts and could result in liability for violations in other jurisdictions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) came into force in 2018 in the EU and requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the EU to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data. Although we believe that we are taking all necessary steps to comply with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws, if we fail to interpret or comply with all requirements of these laws, we may be held liable.\nViolation of these or similar laws and regulations could result in significant monetary penalties and restrictions on our activities. We could experience negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of future lawsuits, claims or regulatory actions, in addition to potential significant costs incurred to defend ourselves or settling claims, fines, penalties and judgments. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq we have substantial regulatory reporting obligations.\nWe are subject to extensive corporate governance, reporting and accounting disclosure requirements under U.S. securities laws and regulations of the SEC. These laws, as well as the listing standards of Nasdaq, impose certain compliance requirements, costs and obligations on listed companies. This requires a significant commitment of resources and management oversight. The expenses associated with being a public company include auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors' fees, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nFailure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act or Dodd-Frank Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory, exchange or market authorities, and related penalties, fines and litigation.\nWe are subject to risks related to anti-corruption laws in effect in the United States and the non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar non-U.S. anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage.\nRecent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings, resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nWe operate through subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the EU, UAE, UK and U.S., Germany, and Cyprus including representative offices of our Cyprus broker in Greece, France and Spain. Enforcement officials generally interpret anti-corruption laws to prohibit, among other things, improper payments to government officials such as those of the CBR, the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market (the \"ARDFM\"), the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"CySEC\"), Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\"BaFIN\") the Center for Coordination and Development of Securities Market of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the National Commission on Securities and Stock Market of Ukraine, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") which are the principal regulatory bodies that control and monitor our operations in the respective countries in which we operate. Our internal policies and those of our subsidiaries provide for training and compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. Despite our training and compliance programs, it is possible that our employees, agents or independent contractors may cause us or a subsidiary to violate applicable laws. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused us or a subsidiary to violate applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nThe countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nThe countries in which we operate have differing, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory regimes governing the delivery of financial services in each country, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the broker-dealer, finance, investment, banking, and insurance industries. In some jurisdictions where we operate, these provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change, and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents of various countries.\nTherefore, there may exist little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes may impact our operations or our customers. It is possible that governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those governing capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements and tax burdens will materially and adversely affect our activities in one or more of the countries where we operate. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is limited in a number of jurisdictions where we operate, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences. If we fail to develop and maintain good working relationships with local regulators, or a local regulator determines that we have violated local laws in a particular market it could negatively impact our businesses in that market and our reputation generally.\nOur revenue and profitability could be affected by changes to rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing foreign ownership, electronic commerce, customer privacy and security of customer data. In addition, changes to laws, rules and regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, could:\n\u2022limit the lines of business we conduct;\n\u2022require us to reduce our ownership stake in a subsidiary;\n\u2022compel us to terminate certain lines of business in affected jurisdictions;\n\u2022result in material cost increases including our cost of capital;\n\u2022otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not similarly impacted;\n\u2022require us to modify existing business practices;\n\u2022force us to relocate operations or personnel;\n\u2022require us to invest significant management attention and resources and legal costs to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions;\n\u2022make it uneconomical for us to provide certain services in particular countries; and\n\u2022influence how we manage our capital and liquidity.\nOur relatively limited operational history has coincided with sustained market growth which may not be predictive of future operating results.\nOur legacy brokerage operations were merged into the Company, which is a Nevada-incorporated holding company, in several stages between November 2015 and 2017, and we have grown rapidly over the last several years. For example, total net revenue was $121.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and has sustained growth each year up to current total net revenue of $564.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Although this growth has been sustained over several years, our operational life has been relatively limited compared to longer term market and macroeconomic cycles. Our operating history has coincided with a period of general growth in the U.S. equity markets, as well as growth in the financial services and technology industries in which we operate. We therefore have not experienced any prolonged downturn or slowdown in macroeconomic or industry growth or any significant downturn in U.S. equity markets and cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to any such downturn or slowdown in the future. As such our recent growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, as a result of the limited operating history of the Company in its current form, and our rapid growth during sustained favorable market and economic conditions, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our future prospects, which subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for, model and manage future growth and risks.\nIncreased competition in the markets in which we operate may result in a decrease in our market share and/or profitability.\nWe face aggressive competition in each of the markets where we offer our services. We compete with international, regional and local brokerage, banking, and financial services firms that offer an array of financial products and services. The retail brokerage and financial services firms with which we principally compete for customers include: Halyk Finance, BCC Invest and First Heartland Securities in Kazakhstan; eToro (Europe) Ltd and Interactive Brokers in Cyprus. While there are many large banks in Kazakhstan, we regard our principal banking competitors in Kazakhstan as Kaspi Bank and Altyn B\u0430nk. Many of the firms with which we compete are larger, provide additional and more diversified services and products, provide access to more international markets, and have greater technical, and financial resources. If we fail to compete effectively with other retail brokerage and financial services firms, or potential new entrants to the market, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Banking Business Activities\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the financial condition and operations of our subsidiaries.\nAs a condition of maintaining our licenses to conduct brokerage and banking activities, some of our subsidiaries must meet ongoing capital and liquidity standards, which are subject to evolving rules and qualitative judgments by government regulators regarding the adequacy of their capital and internal assessment of their capital needs. These net capital rules may limit the ability of each subsidiary to transfer capital to us. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how each subsidiary utilizes its capital and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by our subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could adversely affect the licenses of our subsidiaries, as well as our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may suffer significant losses from credit exposure.\nWe are exposed to credit risk, primarily from institutions and individuals through the brokerage services we offer. We incur credit risk in a number of areas, including margin lending. We extend margin loans to our customers. As of March 31, 2022, we had margin lending receivables in the amount of $349.2 million. When we purchase securities on margin, enter into securities repurchase agreements or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that we, or our customers, may default on those obligations when the value of the securities and cash in our own proprietary or in the customers' accounts falls below the amount of the indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure to meet margin calls could result in substantial financial losses. Margin loans are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers' accounts. The risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements, or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur. During such times, customers who utilize margin loans and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation. We are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions, such as short sales of options and equities that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital. Because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing houses and counterparties from certain liabilities or claims, the use of margin loans and short sales may expose us to significant off-balance-sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations. The amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin lending we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is potentially unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices. As a matter of practice, we enforce real-time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers' positions if their equity falls below established margin requirements.\nWe also have exposure to credit risk from our digital mortgage program. Although we take part in a government mortgage program whereby the Kazakhstan government funds the amount of approved mortgages, we service the mortgages and remain liable for mortgage in the event of default, but we are protected by our security interest in the real property. As such, significant mortgage defaults in Kazakhstan could adversely affect our banking operations and the ultimate success of our digital mortgage product.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our proprietary investments. We rely on the use of credit arrangements as a significant component of our trading strategy. Our investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial markets' assessment of credit quality. Loss in securities value can negatively affect our financial performance and earnings if our management determines that such securities are other-than-temporarily-impaired (OTTI). The evaluation of whether OTTI exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If our management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted, and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the value of securities held in our proprietary portfolio could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were forced to sell the security sooner than intended, we may have to recognize an unrealized loss at that time.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designed to manage credit risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective to protect us against the risk of loss.\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\nOur customers engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our customers' merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our business, liquidity and cost of funding.\nAs a result of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, the long-term issuer credit ratings issued by Standard & Poor's of each of Freedom KZ, Freedom KZ Bank, Freedom Global and Freedom EU were lowered from \"B\" (stable outlook) to \"B-\" (with negative implications) and the credit rating of Freedom RU was downgraded to \"CCC-\" (with negative implications) and later withdrawn. Continuing aggression by Russia and global unrest could result in further ratings downgrades. Decreases in the credit rating of Freedom KZ or its upstream owners may affect Freedom KZ's brokerage license and impose certain requirements on its upstream owners with respect to Freedom KZ's investment portfolio management capacity. Withdrawal of the credit rating of Freedom RU was a contributing factor to our decision to restructure our operations and divest our ownership of Freedom RU.\nReductions in our credit rating, may also adversely affect both our ability to obtain long-term funding and our credit spread and resulting cost of such funding. Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements.\nOur investments can expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\nWe use a significant portion of our capital to engage in a variety of investment activities for our own account, as well as in our exchange-based market making activities. As of March 31, 2022, our assets included $1.2 million of trading securities, approximately 61.4% of which consisted of corporate debt securities and 29.7% non-U.S. sovereign debt securities. We have relied on leverage, including by entering into reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions, to increase the size of our proprietary securities portfolio. As a result, we may face risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies in which we invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategies may not perform as projected. As a result, we may suffer losses from our investment activities. Our proprietary portfolio is leveraged and concentrated in the sovereign debt instruments of a few non-U.S. countries and debt and equities of a number of companies. A consequence of this investment strategy is that our investment returns could be materially and adversely affected if these investments do not perform as anticipated or if the market performs differently than we forecast. Moreover, because we rely on leverage in our portfolio, when an investment does not perform within the time horizon we project, we face the risk of either having to close the position at a time when the market price or liquidity might be unfavorable, or extending financing arrangements beyond the time frame initially anticipated, which can result in paying higher financing costs than projected. If a significant investment such as this fails to perform as anticipated our return on investment, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively affected, and the magnitude of the loss could be significant.\nSubstantially all of our investing and market-making positions are marked-to-market on a daily basis and declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings. Although we may take measures to manage market risk, such as employing position limits, hedging and using quantitative risk measures, we may incur significant losses from our trading activities due to leverage, market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and volatility. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in the value of those assets or markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent we have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially large losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market. We cannot give assurance that our investing and market-making strategies will be effective in all situations or that those activities will always be profitable. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in debt or equity markets, an inability to properly and cost effectively hedge, economic slowdowns, delays in timing of anticipated events, an inability to identify and engage suitable counterparties, or other market conditions adverse to entities or investments of the type in which we invest or for which we make markets, or other world events, such as wars, including the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, natural disasters or the outbreak of a pandemic like COVID-19, could result in a decline in the value of our investments. Additionally, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our investments.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available or available on attractive terms.\nTo satisfy or refinance existing obligations, service our debt obligations, support the development of our business or pursue additional growth through acquisition, we depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to borrow funds and issue securities in the capital markets. To the extent we are unable to generate cash flows sufficient to meet our obligations, we may require additional financing for liquidity, capital requirements or growth initiatives.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and/or increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing on terms and at interest rates that are favorable to us, or at all. An inability to obtain financing in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our relationships with third-party U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit securities and funds internationally.\nWe provide our brokerage customers with access to the U.S. stock markets, and a significant amount of our brokerage business relates to trading in U.S.-listed securities by our brokerage customers. Our PrimeEx subsidiary is not a licensed clearing firm. We rely on the services of a limited number of third-party U.S.-registered securities broker dealer and clearing firms to execute these trades. In executing purchase transactions, we transmit the funds invested by our customers to the relevant U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms, which execute the purchases of the securities. In executing sales, funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers. We also routinely evaluate opportunities to establish relationships with other U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. While part of our strategy is to consider acquiring an ownership interest in a self-clearing company in the United States in the future on an opportunistic basis in order to provide us additional access to the U.S. stock markets, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately do so. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with the U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firm on which we currently rely could impair our ability to continue to provide our customers access to the U.S. markets at the volumes and in the manner they are accustomed to and could result in higher transaction costs for us or our customers, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on our relationship with FFIN Brokerage for a significant percentage of our revenue, and as a result of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict the future prospects of FFIN Brokerage are uncertain.\nIn November 2015, when our legacy brokerage operations began to be merged into the Company, Timur Turlov became our controlling shareholder, a member of our board of directors and our chief executive officer. Prior to that, in July 2014, Timur Turlov established FFIN Brokerage. As a foreign broker dealer, FFIN Brokerage had been able to provide investors in Russia and Kazakhstan with easier access to the U.S. securities markets than a Russian or Kazakhstan company could provide, due to applicable regulations in Russia and Kazakhstan which imposed restrictions on foreign currency accounts, required mandatory securities custody in-country, and limited access to foreign securities, unless listed on local exchanges. The current condition of the Russian securities markets and the impacts of sanctions might adversely impact the business of FFIN Brokerage. If FFIN Brokerage's business contracts as a result of the Conflict or related geopolitical consequences, or the scope of sanctions adversely impacts its ability to do business, the demand for services we provide to FFIN Brokerage and consequently the revenue we derive from this business relationship could be reduced and could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may suffer significant loss from changes in the KASE's requirements related to the discount coefficients on the securities in securities repurchase transactions.\nAs part of our investment activities, both as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders and on a proprietary basis, we raise funds through repurchase transactions on the KASE. Our short-term financing is primarily obtained through securities repurchase arrangements. As of March 31, 2022, $769.6 million, or 64%, of the trading securities held in our proprietary trading account were subject to securities repurchase obligations. The securities we pledge as collateral under repurchase agreements are liquid trading securities with market quotes and significant trading volume.\nDepending on the reliability of the instrument used to secure the repurchase transaction, the KASE has established the size of the discount for securities. The discount is a decreasing coefficient that sets the maximum borrowing amount for repurchase transactions in relation to each individual instrument. In the event of unexpected changes in the terms of the discount, we may incur financial losses associated with the need to sell securities to cover liquidity at a cost disadvantageous to us, or due to the need to borrow necessary funds at higher rates.\nOur measures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions violations may not be completely effective.\nNotwithstanding the anti-money-laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) regulations that are in place in Russia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, the risk remains that financial institutions in such jurisdictions could be used as vehicles for money laundering. Russia is a member country of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (\u201cFATF\u201d) and Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Group (an Associate Member of the FATF) and each has enacted laws and regulations to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes.\nMinimum standards and duties according to the anti-money laundering legislation in Russia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate include customer identification, analysis of the customer's economic profile, record keeping, suspicious activity reporting, employee training, an audit function and designation of a compliance officer. Suspicious transactions must be reported on a daily basis to the relevant authorities. We comply with applicable anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorist-financing laws and regulations. Our anti-money-laundering measures are based on relevant legislation. We have procedures and documents aimed at preventing money laundering and financing of terrorist activities, including a general anti-money-laundering policy, employee training, the designation of a compliance officer, internal control procedures that include a refusal policy whereby we may refuse to conduct business with suspicious entities or individuals and rules on counteracting money laundering and financing of individuals and legal entities engaged in terrorist activities. In the case of suspicious transactions, internal suspicion reports (ISRs) are submitted to the local compliance departments for initial internal investigation. In case of confirmed suspicious transactions, such transactions are reported immediately to the relevant local financial intelligence unit (FIU). We have a U.S. Sanctions Compliance Policy and we are deploying an enterprise-wide standardized customer onboarding and customer ongoing monitoring in our group of companies, taking into account any local requirements.\nUnder relevant AML/CTF laws, penalties and other enforcement actions could be brought against us due to breaches of those laws and regulations, economic sanctions and similar laws by FFIN Brokerage despite the fact that we have no direct control over the activities or policies of FFIN Brokerage. Freedom EU has a Cross Border Correspondent Relationship Agreement (the \u201cCorrespondent Agreement\u201d) with FFIN Brokerage wherein FFIN Brokerage has agreed to follow sanctions laws and AML/CTF controls that are applicable to brokers in the U.S. and EU, and to grant access to its customer records for purposes of compliance monitoring as we request. In accordance with the Correspondent Agreement, our subsidiary Freedom EU conducts random checks on a regular basis of trades received from FFIN Brokerage, whereby it is able to obtain information on, and conduct customer checks on, the beneficial owners who are the beneficiaries of the relevant trades. FFIN Brokerage utilizes a third party provider platform to onboard and confirm liveness, facematch and AML/sanctions screening on an ongoing basis. We do not have direct access to FFIN Brokerage's customer check systems. Under relevant AML and anti-terrorism finance laws, penalties and other enforcement actions could be brought against us due to breaches of those laws and regulations, economic sanctions and similar laws by FFIN Brokerage despite the fact that we have no direct control over the activities or policies of FFIN Brokerage.\nWe have not been subject to investigation with respect to any involvement in money laundering or terrorist financing and we believe that we fully comply with the reporting requirements under applicable legislation. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not attempt to use us as a conduit for money laundering or terrorist financing without our knowledge, nor that the measures described above will be completely effective. Any technical or other breaches of the anti-money laundering laws and regulations by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business in Emerging Markets\nEmerging markets, such as many of the markets in which we operate, are subject to greater risks than more mature markets, including significant political, economic and legal risks.\nGenerally, investments in emerging markets are only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate the significance of the risks involved. Investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risk than more mature markets, including in some cases significant political, economic and legal risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing legal rights;\n\u2022corruption in certain countries;\n\u2022economic volatility and sustained economic downturns;\n\u2022restrictive changes in securities brokerage, financial services and banking laws;\n\u2022differing and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory regimes;\n\u2022unpredictable, uncertain and potentially adverse changes to tax regimes;\n\u2022difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a number of international operations;\n\u2022risks related to government regulation;\n\u2022uncertain protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022uncertain and changing judicial and regulatory environments and requirements;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency exchange controls;\n\u2022procuring adequate insurance; and\n\u2022political or social unrest, including domestic protests such as occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022 and international conflicts, such as the Russia/Ukraine Conflict in February 2022.\nEmerging market governments and judiciaries often exercise broad, unchecked discretion and are susceptible to abuse and corruption. Investors should also note that emerging economies such as the economies of Russia and Kazakhstan are subject to rapid change and that the information set out herein may become outdated relatively quickly. Moreover, financial, political or social turmoil in any emerging market country can disrupt the local securities markets.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.\nBecause our business is conducted in multiple countries, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and can have a material impact on our financial statements. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries include the Russian ruble, the Euro, Great British Pounds, Ukrainian hryvnia, Uzbekistan som, Kazakhstan tenge, Kyrgyzstan som, Azerbaijan manat, Armenian dram, and the United Arab Emirates dirham. For financial reporting purposes, those currencies are translated into U.S. dollars as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. As the value of the functional currencies of our subsidiaries weakens against the U.S. dollar, we may realize losses arising as a result of translating such foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Conversely, as the value of the U.S. dollar weakens against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we may realize gains arising as a result of currency translation.\nWe conduct operations in several different currencies. This subjects us to currency exchange rate risk. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. For example, the countrywide unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 and again following the onset of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict the government of Kazakhstan and the CBR, respectively, imposed rules, that included strict restrictions on currency operations between residents and non-residents, Such rules may be imposed when the applicable regulator believes there exists a serious threat to the stability of payment balances, the foreign currency market or economic security and can have a significant impact on currency rate fluctuation.\nIn February and March 2022, the Kazakhstan tenge and Russian ruble depreciated significantly against major foreign currencies amid the geopolitical situation. However, in April and May 2022, Kazakhstan and Russia have been able to strengthen the tenge and ruble, respectively, with capital controls and higher interest rates, bringing them much closer to pre-conflict levels. These fluctuations in our operating currencies resulted in losses on foreign exchange operations during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 fiscal year-end and subsequent improvement in our first fiscal quarter 2023 as those currencies recovered. We cannot assure that such currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the future. While we may employ strategies to hedge against currency fluctuations, the use of such strategies can also result in the loss of potential benefits that might result from favorable exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe face interest rate change risks.\nFluctuations in interest rates can impact our earnings. Declines in interest rates can have a detrimental effect on the interest we earn. A rise in interest rates could negatively impact us if we hold securities that have an inverse relationship with interest rates or where market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets.\nTo reduce the negative impact of sanctions and other actions related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict on the Kazakhstan and Russian economies, the NBK raised the base rate from 10.25% to 14% per annum and the CBR raised the base rate from 9.5% to 20% initially with subsequent decreases to the current rate of 14% per annum. The base rates were increased to ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks. This was needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of Kazakhstan and Russian citizens from depreciation. However, these rate raises contributed to a significant net loss on our trading securities, largely due to the revaluation of our bond positions. Further interest rate hikes in the future could have similar negative effects.\nThe economies of Kazakhstan and other countries in which we operate are vulnerable to external shocks and fluctuations in the global economy.\nShocks and fluctuations to the global economy may adversely impact Kazakhstan and the other countries in which we operate. For example, a significant amount of our operations are conducted in Kazakhstan, and our principal executive office is located in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's economy and finances have been affected adversely by global financial developments and political changes. Real GDP growth decreased from 4.2% in 2014 to 1.2% in 2015 and 1.1% in 2016 before increasing to 4.1% in 2017, 4.1% in 2018 and to 4.5% in 2019. In 2020, Kazakhstan's real GDP contracted by 2.6% (based on preliminary data) principally due to the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 it increased to 4.0%. The rapid decrease in the GDP growth rate after 2014 was principally attributable to a decrease in global demand for oil and gas and the resulting decrease in oil production and a fall in oil prices. In 2020, the Kazakhstan economy was significantly impacted by the sharp decline in oil prices following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. While in recent years Kazakhstan has sought to diversify its economy and, in particular, to increase export of manufacturing products, Kazakhstan continues to remain heavily reliant on the oil and gas industry and on hydrocarbon exports.\nChanges in both the global and domestic environment have resulted in, among other things, lower liquidity levels across the banking sector, tighter credit conditions for Kazakhstan companies generally and fluctuating global demand for, and instability in, the price of crude oil and other commodities and downward pressure on the tenge. For example, the tenge experienced a significant depreciation against the U.S. dollar in 2018 mainly due to significant deterioration of external factors, such as depreciation of the Russian ruble and the decrease in crude oil prices (starting from October 2018) due to increased oil reserves and oil production by principal exporters. The tenge depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar by 10.4% in 2020 primarily due to a sharp fall in oil prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The tenge also experienced significant initial depreciation as a result of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, but in the past few months since the Conflict began has returned to near pre-conflict levels.\nKazakhstan and other regional economies remain vulnerable to external shocks and the economic performance of their trading partners. A significant decline in economic growth in the EU or any of these countries' other major trading partners, including Russia (whether or not resulting from sanctions imposed by, among others, the U.S. and the EU), could have a material adverse effect on the balance of trade and adversely affect economic growth.\nWeaknesses in the global economy, or a future external economic crisis, may have a negative effect on economies or investors' confidence in the markets where we operate. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nKazakhstan's economy is vulnerable to internal social/political unrest.\nThe countrywide unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 resulted in major interruptions to Kazakhstan's financial market. As a result of internet shutdowns (or limited access to it) and the state of emergency declared by the president of Kazakhstan, our Kazakhstan subsidiaries, along with other financial institutions in Kazakhstan, were unable to conduct operations or operated with limited functionality during the unrest. We are currently exploring the possibility of obtaining alternative ways to access internet in such emergency situations and to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of losing access to the internet. This event also resulted in significant changes to the Kazakhstan government and reshuffling of government officials. This could result in future impacts to the financial markets in Kazakhstan, including possible amendments to legislation that may limit or make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations or make our services less attractive to our customers.\nEconomic and political instability in Russia could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we plan to divest our Russian subsidiaries, we have not yet done so and even after doing so, we will likely continue to do business with Russian companies and citizens. As a result, our business and results of operations may be significantly impacted by economic and political conditions in Russia. Over the last two decades, the Russian economy has experienced and may continue to experience at various times:\n\u2022significant volatility in its GDP;\n\u2022the impact of international sanctions;\n\u2022high levels of inflation;\n\u2022increases in, or high, interest rates;\n\u2022sudden price declines in oil and other natural resources;\n\u2022instability in the local currency market;\n\u2022lack of reform in the banking sector and a weak banking system providing limited liquidity to Russian enterprises;\n\u2022budget deficits;\n\u2022the continued operation of loss-making enterprises due to the lack of effective bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022capital flight; and\n\u2022significant increases in poverty rates, unemployment and underemployment.\nBeyond the risks associated with these economic conditions and the Russia/Ukraine Conflict risks discussed in \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Russia/Ukraine Conflict\" and elsewhere in this Item 1A, other notable risks related to the Russian political regime and our business activities in Russia, include: regulatory authorities could impose limitations on our operational flexibility; the implementation of government policies targeted at specific individuals or companies; laws restricting foreign investment; Russian anti-money laundering legislation may adversely impact our transaction volumes; mandatory U.S. and EU sanctions screening may be inhibited by Russian data privacy laws and constraints; and know-your-client requirements established by companies with which we do business. The actions of the Russian legislative, executive and judicial authorities can affect the Russian securities market as well as banks and other businesses operating in Russia. In particular, the events surrounding claims brought by the Russian authorities against several major Russian companies have led to questions being raised regarding the progress of market and political reforms in Russia and have resulted in significant fluctuations in the market price of Russian securities and a negative impact on foreign direct and portfolio investment in the Russian economy.\nTaxation Risks Related to our International Operations\nGlobal anti-offshore measures could adversely impact our business.\nIn 2013 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") and G20 countries accepted that existing international tax rules create opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting. Pursuing solutions for this problem, the OECD and G20 countries adopted a 15-point Action Plan to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\").\nThe BEPS package of measures represents a substantial renovation of the international tax rules. In light of the new measures, it is expected that profits will be reported where the economic activities that generate them are carried out and where value is created.\nThe Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters developed by the Council of Europe and the OECD in 1988 and amended by Protocol in 2010 is now signed by 141 jurisdictions (Russia, Cyprus, Kazakhstan are among the signatories). This Convention, requires competent authorities of jurisdictions-signatories to participate in the automatic exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant for the administration or enforcement of their domestic laws concerning the taxes. In addition the Convention requires competent authorities of jurisdictions-signatories to participate in the exchange of information on request and, by virtue of Article 7, stipulates that such competent authorities should participate in spontaneous exchange of information. In 2016 Russia (in 2018 Kazakhstan) joined the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (Common Reporting Standard, the \"CRS\").\nThe CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. Russia also adopted country-by-country reporting (\"CbCR\") requirements which assume an automatic exchange of county-by-country reports.\nThe above developments in terms of global information exchange could complicate tax planning as well as related business decisions and could possibly expose us to significant fines and penalties and to enforcement measures, despite our best efforts at compliance, and could result in a greater than expected tax burden.\nOn November 24, 2016, the OECD published the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (\"MLI\") which introduces new provisions to existing double tax treaties limiting the use of tax benefits provided thereby. As a minimum standard MLI implements principle purposes test, under which treaty benefits are disallowed if one of the principle purposes of the transaction or the structure was to obtain a tax benefit.\nThe MLI was ratified by Russia on May 1, 2019, by Cyprus on January 22, 2020 and by Kazakhstan on February 20, 2020. Application of the MLI could potentially limit tax benefits granted by double tax treaties of Russia, Cyprus and Kazakhstan.\nFrequent tax law changes in regions where we conduct operations could adversely affect our business and the value of investments.\nWe are subject to a broad range of taxes and other compulsory payments imposed at federal, regional and local levels (pertinent to the Russian tax system), including, but not limited to, profits tax, VAT and social contributions. Tax laws, namely the Kazakhstan and Russian tax codes, have been in force for a short period relative to tax laws in more developed market economies, and the implementation of these tax laws is still unclear or inconsistent. The tax laws and regulations in our regions outside the U.S. are subject to frequent changes, varying and contradicting interpretations, and inconsistent and selective enforcement. Notably, although the quality of Russian tax legislation has generally improved since the introduction of the first and second parts of the Russian Tax Code, there is a possibility that in the future Russia may impose arbitrary or burdensome taxes and penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Federal Law No. 340-FZ introducing CbCR requirements was published. The mandatory filing requirements or CbCR apply to financial years starting in 2017 (except for the provisions regarding the national documentation). Thus, if we reach the reporting threshold established for the consolidated revenue of the group (over RUB 50 billion if parent company for CbCR purposes is regarded as Russian tax resident or over the relevant threshold established in any other jurisdiction as applicable (e.g. EUR 750 million for Cyprus)) we may be required to submit relevant CbCR reports. It is unclear at the moment how the above measures will be applied in practice by the tax authorities and courts. Similar requirements are imposed by other jurisdictions in which we do business, including but not limited to, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\nRussian transfer pricing legislation may require pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities.\nThe existing Russian transfer pricing rules became effective on January 1, 2012. Under these rules the Russian tax authorities are allowed to make transfer-pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of certain types of transactions (\"controlled\" transactions). The list of the \"controlled\" transactions includes transactions with related parties (with several exceptions such as guarantees between Russian non-banking organizations and interest-free loans between Russian related parties) and certain types of cross-border transactions.\nThe burden of proving market prices, as well as keeping specific documentation, lies with the taxpayers. In certain circumstances, the Russian tax authorities may apply the transfer pricing rules and methods in cases where the rules are formally not applicable, claiming additional tax charges calculated using the transfer rules but based on other tax concepts (e.g., anti-avoidance rules, lack of economic justification of expenses, etc.). It is therefore possible that our Russian subsidiaries may become subject to transfer pricing tax audits by tax authorities in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Russian tax authorities may challenge the level of prices applied by us under the \"controlled\" transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) or challenge the methods used to prove prices applied by us, and as a result accrue additional tax liabilities. If additional taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRussian anti-offshore measures expose us to tax liability risks.\nRussia, like a number of other countries in the world, is actively involved in the implementation of measures against tax evasion tactics such as the use of low tax jurisdictions and aggressive tax planning structures. Starting from January 1, 2015, the Federal Law No. 376-FZ, introduced the concept of \"controlled foreign companies\" (the \"CFC Rules\"), the concept of \"corporate tax residency\" and the concept of \"beneficial ownership\" into Russian tax legislation, came into force. Certain provisions of the Russian CFC Rules are still ambiguous and may be subject to arbitrary interpretation by the Russian tax authorities.\nAnother tax risk is associated with the concept of \"corporate tax residency.\" Notably, when an entity is recognized as a Russian tax resident it is obligated to register with the Russian tax authorities, calculate and pay Russian tax on its worldwide income and comply with other tax-related rules established for Russian entities. There is still an uncertainty as to how these criteria will be applied by the Russian tax authorities in practice.\nAnother Russia-related issue that triggers tax risks for us is the implementation of the \"beneficial owner\" concept. To date, although the Russian Tax Authorities have issued clarification letters with guidance indicating the beneficial owner of income, including reference to information to justify nonresidents' beneficial owner status (financial statements, tax returns, lists of employees, etc.), there is still no officially approved format of such confirmation letter and the precise list of documents to be obtained from the recipient of income claiming the beneficial owner status.\nWe might be subject to additional or unforeseen tax liabilities because of these and other Russian tax law changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUncertainties and ongoing changes in Kazakhstan's tax regime may have an adverse impact on our business.\nKazakhstan's tax regime is subject to ongoing changes, resulting in uncertainties in the interpretation and application of its tax laws. For example, the Kazakhstan government has taken steps to promote investment in its financial markets, including providing a preferential tax regime within the AIFC established by the AIFC Constitutional Law. Among other tax benefits, there is an exemption from corporate income tax of commission income earned by the AIFC-registered member from rendering defined financial services in the AIFC. It is currently unclear whether an AIFC-registered member is eligible for the tax benefits if, for example, it renders services online through employees working outside the AIFC. As a result of these uncertainties, the availability of these new tax exemptions to us is currently unclear.\nMore generally, Kazakhstan tax legislation is subject to frequent changes, varying and potentially contradicting interpretations and inconsistencies. There can be no assurance that Kazakhstan tax legislation will be amended in the future in a manner that makes our tax planning more predictable. Further, the introduction of new taxes, amendments to current taxation rules, or new interpretations of existing tax law may have a substantial impact on the overall amount of our tax liabilities. As a result , there is no assurance that we will not be required to make substantially larger tax payments in the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in regulations related to taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions could reduce the volume of market transactions and impact our business.\nChanges to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on our business or profitability, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to us due to our corporate structure. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration has proposed tax policy ideas that if enacted would, among other things, increase the corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI).\nBecause of certain tax advantages, we realize in certain jurisdictions where we operate, the proposed changes in the GILTI tax rate by the current administration, which have not yet been adopted and may change significantly before being implemented, if at all, could result in significantly higher tax burdens on us in the U.S., which could offset some of the favorable tax advantages we realize in some of the jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Internal Operations\nWe are in process of divesting our interest in our Russian subsidiaries and undergoing a related corporate restructuring, and the approval, completion and consequences of these plans cannot be assured.\nWe are planning to divest our interests in our Russian subsidiaries, Freedom RU and Freedom Bank RU. In addition, we are planning to transfer the ownership of our Kazakhstan securities brokerage company, Freedom KZ (together with its wholly owned subsidiary Freedom Bank KZ) from Freedom RU to FRHC. These plans are subject to various contingencies and risks, and their completion and the success of their underlying business objectives cannot be guaranteed.\nThe completion of these restructuring plans will be subject to the potential effects of applicable U.S. sanctions and Russian countersanctions. These sanctions are evolving and the scope of activities that they curtail are subject to change. At present we do not expect the divestiture and restructuring will result in a violation of any currently applicable sanctions or countersanctions, but we cannot make any assurances that the interpretation of, or changes to, such sanctions regimes will not adversely affect our restructuring plans. We believe the planned divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries is not subject to approval from the CBR, however, given the evolving nature of the Russian countersactions and their implementation, we cannot assure that such approval will not be required. The transfer of Freedom KZ is subject to approval by the ARDFM. We can make no assurances that required approvals will be granted. We currently believe these are the only required or potentially required regulatory approvals to complete the restructuring, but given the evolving nature of sanctions, countersanctions and government regulation, it is possible that further approvals might be required, the receipt of which we cannot assure. If these transactions do not take place or subject us to unforeseen liabilities, it could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and branding, business, results of operations, and could expose us to continued known and unknown risks associated with our ownership of Russian entities.\nAs a diversified holding company with few operations of our own we are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund holding company operations.\nOur operations are conducted primarily through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of our subsidiaries for any reason, including the risks discussed herein as applicable or the occurrence of such events to any such subsidiary, could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions to us. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable laws or regulations or under the terms of financing arrangements or are otherwise unable to provide funds to the extent of our needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a \"controlled company\" under Nasdaq rules, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that may adversely affect our stock price.\nTimur Turlov controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by one individual is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements that:\n\u2022a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022its audit committee, nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u2022each committee have a written charter addressing such committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022an annual evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee be performed.\nWe currently utilize an exemption to allow Timur Turlov to sit on our nominating and corporate governance committee and our risk committee. The charters for each of our board committees provides for annual performance evaluations. Currently we have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors.\nOur status as a controlled company and resulting available exemptions from corporate governance standards could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nThe interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with those of other shareholders.\nTimur Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board, beneficially owns 71.2% of our outstanding common stock. He currently has voting control of FRHC and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval. In addition, Timur Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer, chairman of our board and his ability to control the election of our directors. As majority shareholder, Timur Turlov owes fiduciary duties to minority shareholders under Nevada law. Timur Turlov also owes fiduciary duties to the Company as a board member and officer. However, Nevada corporate law can be viewed as more protective of officers and directors than the corporate laws of other U.S. state jurisdictions, and therefore may not provide the same level of redress as other U.S. state corporate laws. Timur Turlov is prohibited from membership on the audit committee and the compensation committee of our board under the terms of their respective committee charters.\nCivil liability may be difficult or impossible to enforce against us.\nCertain of our directors, substantially all of our officers, and our controlling shareholder reside outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the U.S. in jurisdictions that are not parties to treaties or other agreements with the U.S. for the mutual enforcement of U.S. court judgments. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to enforce against us or such persons judgments of U.S. courts.\nFor example, the Civil Procedure Code of Kazakhstan, which became effective on January 1, 2016, provides that Kazakhstan courts should recognize and enforce foreign court judgments only if provided for by Kazakhstan law or an international treaty to which Kazakhstan is a party (based on reciprocity). Kazakhstan is not a party to any multilateral or bilateral treaties with the UK or the U.S. (or most other western jurisdictions) for the mutual enforcement of court judgments, and, accordingly, there is a risk that a judgment obtained from a court in England or New York would not be enforceable in Kazakhstan courts. Each of Kazakhstan, the UK and the U.S. are, however, parties to the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (the \"Convention\"), and, accordingly, an arbitral award under the Convention should generally be recognized and enforceable in Kazakhstan provided the conditions to enforcement set out in the Convention and applicable Kazakhstan laws are met. The Civil Procedure Code of Kazakhstan establishes the procedure for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\nWe are dependent on our executive management team, particularly Timur Turlov, and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our executive management team, in particular Timur Turlov, and the management teams of our subsidiaries. These individuals have made significant contributions to our success and we believe our success moving forward depends, to a significant extent, on the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. If certain individuals leave or are otherwise no longer available to us for any reason, including because of the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries, the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, or social unrest, we may not be able to replace them with comparable capable personnel.\nThe pool of experienced and qualified employee candidates is limited in some of the geographical areas where we conduct business, and competition for skilled employees can be significant. We are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, adequately train and retain skilled employees. Additionally, we rely on experienced managerial, marketing and support personnel to effectively manage and operate our business. If we do not succeed in engaging and retaining skilled employees and other personnel or if we experience a loss of such personnel, we may be unable to meet our objectives and, as a result, our business may suffer.\nWe may not be able to properly manage our growth.\nWe have experienced recent rapid growth in our business over a short period. Our number of total customer accounts increased from approximately 140,000 as of March 31, 2020 to approximately 410,000 as of March 31, 2022.\nOur total number of employees increased from 1,493 employees as of March 31, 2020 to 3,421 employees as of March 31, 2022. Our total assets increased by 544% to US $2.9 billion as of March 31, 2022 from US $453.5 million as of March 31, 2020. In addition, we have made a number of recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of JSC Investment Company Zerich Capital (\"Zerich\") in July 2020, Freedom Bank KZ and PrimeEx in December 2020, and Freedom Life and Freedom Insurance in May 2022.\nWe are currently in process of acquiring three additional Kazakhstan companies with technologies we plan to integrate into our fintech platform in Kazakhstan, including an online payment processing platform, an online ticketing service and a web-based PCI reader. Acquisitions can divert time and attention of management and key employees from other tasks important to the success of our business. There can be no assurance that our management and key employees will successfully manage these additional responsibilities, particularly at the current time, against the backdrop of the divestiture of our Russian subsidiaries. Similarly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to properly manage our growth or achieve positive returns on investments that we make in the development of our business. As we grow, our business requires the effective expansion and maintenance of our financial, IT and information management control systems, the continued training of our personnel, continued efforts to maintain or enhance the quality of our customer service operations and the recruitment of additional employees. Should we fail to properly manage our growth, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe anticipate that acquisitions will continue to play a key role in our growth strategy, but we may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nAcquisitions have been, and continue to be, a significant component of our growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions as we have done historically, that businesses acquired will perform in accordance with our expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. For example, we recently agreed to mutually terminate our acquisition of a U.S.-based institutional equity research, sales and trading firm due to business and market conditions arising from recent international geopolitical conditions. However, we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, expand our customer base or enhance our existing service offerings. There is no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor is there assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful.\nIn addition, there are substantial risks associated with acquisitions and expansion into new business areas, including risks that (i) our unfamiliarity with new lines of business may adversely affect the success of such acquisitions, (ii) revenue from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, regulatory and other implementation costs, (iii) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, and (iv) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. There is also substantial cost and time expended to complete post-closing integration of acquisitions, including human resource training, data and technology systems and operational processes. We may also incur potential dilution of our brand, assumption of known and unknown liabilities, indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. Any such difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and/or synergies of any such acquisition or investment.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security\nOur broker-dealer, financial services, and banking operations are highly dependent on the continued and proper functioning of our information technology systems.\nOur broker-dealer, financial services and banking businesses are highly dependent on processing, on a daily basis, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in various languages. These communications and transactions are accomplished primarily through electronic information technology systems (\"IT\") that are comprised of a wide array of computer systems, software, server and network hardware, internet connectivity and underlying infrastructure that enable them to function. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems we or the firms that clear transactions on behalf of our customers use may fail to operate properly, become disabled, or otherwise become unavailable, as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control.\nThese events may include a disruption of electrical, communications, internet or other infrastructure, or related services, or our inability to access or use one or more of our facilities, as a result of any number of occurrences, including, but not limited to, the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, social unrest such as occurred in Kazakhstan in January 2022, or armed conflict such as the Russia/Ukraine Conflict.\nThe inability of these systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our business operations.\nIf any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or otherwise unavailable, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, personnel, or systems related to the electronic communications and functionality our operations depend on, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of business, liability to customers, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage.\nIn particular, our \"Tradernet\" electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that plays a key role in both our customers' use of our services and for other important aspects of our business. Errors, failures, delays, interruptions, disruptions, vulnerabilities, bugs, incompatibility, obsolescence, or similar issues with Tradernet, or the software or systems upon which Tradernet relies for its functionality, however caused, could result in business disruptions, financial loss, reputational damage, and other adverse impacts on our business.\nWe interact with large volumes of sensitive data that exposes us to IT breach and other data security risks and liabilities.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, personal, financial and other information in our computer systems and networks. In particular, our ability to operate our business, and specifically our proprietary electronic trading platform, Tradernet, depends on our ability to protect the computer systems, networks and databases that we operate and use from unauthorized intrusions of third parties, including cyber attacks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, spyware or other malicious code, and other evolving cyber security threats.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could: (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of our customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business; or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties with whom we conduct business. In addition, new and expanding data privacy laws and regulations (such as the GDPR, as discussed above in this Item 1A at \"We operate in highly regulated industries\") are, or soon will be, in effect in many of the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and compliance failures could result in significant fines, penalties and liability.\nWe have previously encountered cyber security incidents which breached our information systems, but these were contained by our response teams and generated negligible impacts. There is also a possibility that we are not currently aware of certain undisclosed vulnerabilities in our IT systems and other assets. There is an increased likelihood that escalation of tensions from the Russia/Ukraine Conflict could result in cyber attacks that could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Although our subsidiaries have implemented cyber security strategies for mitigating these risks, we cannot be sure that our network and information technology systems will not be subject to such issues, or, if they are, that we will be able to maintain the integrity of our customers' and employees' data or that malware or other technical or operational issues will not disrupt our network or systems and cause significant harm to our operations. If our services are affected by attacks or malware and this degrades our services, our products and services may be perceived as being vulnerable to cyber risk and the integrity of our data protection systems may be questioned. As a result, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we might incur reputational damage, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, reimbursement or other compensatory costs.\nAs of the date of this report, most of our employees have returned to working on site rather than remotely, which we believe lessens the overall IT risks associated with widespread remote work. However, possible outbreaks or other events occur in the future, we may again be required to move a significant portion of our workforce to working remotely. We continue use risk management and contingency plans and other precautions designed to address the heightened risk of cyber security breaches resulting from a significant remote work force. However, we cannot assure that such measures will continue to adequately protect our business in the event of future transitions of our workforce to remote working, as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to cyber security threats.\nWe do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses.\nThe infrastructure on which our IT systems depend is subject to events that could interrupt our ability to operate.\nThe infrastructure upon which our operations and IT systems depend, including electrical communications and internet, and transportation and other services, are vulnerable to damage or disruptions from events outside our control, including natural disasters, military conflicts, power, telecommunications and internet unavailability or outages, terrorist acts, riots, government shutdown orders, changes in government regulation, equipment or system failures or an inability to access or operate such equipment or systems, human error or intentional wrongdoings, cyber-attacks or any other types of information technology security threats.\nIn addition, as we operate in emerging markets which may have an increased threat of terrorism, military conflict, social unrest or governmental interference with infrastructure, which could result in property damage, business interruption and damage to our brand or reputation. The local authorities may order our subsidiaries to temporarily shut down their entire network or part or all of our networks may be shut down due to actions relating to military conflicts, social unrest or a nationwide strike. For example, during the social unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022, the Kazakhstan government temporarily shut down access to the internet with resulted in severance of internal communications within our Kazakhstan subsidiaries and potentially put us at a greater security risk. At this time, however, we are unaware of any security breaches resulting from such events.\nBecause we have employees in a number of cities in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Germany, Spain, Greece, France. the UAE, the UK, the U.S. and Cyprus, all of whom need to work and communicate as an integrated team, the functionality of the infrastructure affects our ability to conduct business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers may suffer. While we have contingency plans in place to address such issues, these plans may not always be deployed successfully or be sufficiently adequate to fully offset the impacts of such disruptions. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses.\nIn addition, the computers and data centers that process trades and payments are located in the same locale. If a catastrophic event were to occur at that locale it may result in permanent data loss. More generally, substantial property and equipment loss, and disruption in operations as well as any defects in our systems or those of third parties or other difficulties could expose us to liability and materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any outage or disruptive efforts could adversely impact our reputation and other aspects of our business.\nFailure of third-party systems and operations on which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including clearing systems, other broker-dealers, exchange systems, banking systems, internet service, co-location facilities, communications facilities and other facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in their performance, could be disruptive to our business. If our arrangement with any third-party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, funds invested by our customers in securities of U.S. companies are transmitted by us to U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. Funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. We do not have any control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair our customer relationships. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with these U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms could also impair our ability to continue to offer such services to our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Securities and Banking Business Activities - We are dependent upon our relationships with third party U.S.-registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit securities and funds internationally.\"\nOur success also depends on the continued availability, development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure globally and particularly in the countries in which we operate. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services. Any disruption in network access provided by third parties or any failure by them to handle current or higher future volumes of use may significantly harm our business. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service from time to time. Furthermore, we depend on hardware and software suppliers for prompt delivery, installation and service of servers and other equipment to deliver our services.\nIn connection with the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, the Russian authorities have placed increased restrictions on access to the internet, including limiting global internet connections for Russian users, restricting access to certain internet sites and imposing regulations governing various information technology service providers.\nThese restrictions increase the risks that we will not be able to adequately or timely communicate with customers and vendors in Russia in order to provide our services, and could result in the loss of such business.\nTo remain competitive, we must keep pace with rapid technological change.\nThe global securities industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, shifting industry standards and evolving trading systems, practices and techniques. Our customers' needs and demands fluctuate with these changes. We are focused on anticipating and developing technologies to meet the constantly changing demands of the market through ongoing enhancement of our products, services and platforms. If our platforms and systems do not operate properly, are slow to market, provide customers with a poor user experience, or are non-competitive with the offering of our competitors, we could experience a loss in business that could reduce our earnings or cause a loss of revenue.\nIn particular, our \"Tradernet\" electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that has taken substantial resources and time to build and requires continued development to remain competitive with other trading platforms. Adoption or development of superior platforms or technologies by our competitors may require us to devote substantial resources to the further development of Tradernet, or other platforms, to remain competitive. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop, adapt or acquire up-to-date technology that meets ever evolving industry standards. We may not always be correct or timely in our assessment of how technological changes may impact our business. If we are unable to develop, adapt to, access or acquire technology that meets or exceeds industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor instance, in Kazakhstan we have developed an online-based platform that integrates Kazakhstan government databases with our services, making our service offerings faster and more convenient than services without this integration. We do not control these government databases and cannot guarantee that we will always have access to these databases or proper functionality with these databases. For us to expand this sort of integrated product outside of Kazakhstan, we are also reliant on similar databases being available and able to integrate with our systems in the jurisdictions to which we expand, the availability of which will likely vary greatly between jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, many of our competitors are larger, more experienced and have greater resources to devote to the development of new technologies and services. If we are unable to keep pace with their development efforts our customers may find our platforms and services less compelling, which could lead to customer losses or a reduction in the revenue we generate from our product and service offerings.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022the Russia/Ukraine Conflict and related sanctions;\n\u2022geopolitical and civil unrest in any of the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022pandemic and epidemic disease;\n\u2022our planned disposition of our Russian subsidiaries;\n\u2022new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022material breaches of our regulatory compliance by our employees;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022investigations, lawsuits, enforcement actions, and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022announcements by us of significant impairment charges;\n\u2022investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships; and\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community.\nStock markets can experience extreme volatility unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture offerings of securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to fix the relative rights and preferences of our 20,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, without approval from our stockholders. This could affect the rights of our common stockholders regarding, among other things, voting, distributions, dividends and liquidation. We could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control of the Company that may be opposed by our management, even if the transaction might be favorable to our common stockholders.\nIf, in the future, we issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is possible that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that future offerings might reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute the value of their stock holdings in the Company.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to use our future earnings to repay debt, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. We are not likely to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in the value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its current value.\nPayments of dividends, if any, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of such dividends. Further, Nevada law imposes additional requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe are subject to risks of litigation, and administrative and regulatory action arising from our operating activities.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries and are exposed to significant legal risks. We may be subject to legal claims from our customers and counterparties, as well as regulatory actions brought against us by the regulators and self-regulatory agencies that oversee and regulate the industries in which we operate. From time to time, we have been, and in the future may be subject to investigations, regulatory proceedings, fines and penalties brought by regulators. We may be subject to employment-related claims and disputes with taxing authorities and other claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and economic sanctions. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations could result in significant monetary penalties, restrictions on our activities, loss of licenses, criminal charges, officer and director bans, and other adverse actions. We could experience negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of investigations, lawsuits, claims or regulatory actions, in addition to potential significant costs incurred to defend ourselves or settle claims, fines, penalties and judgments. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExtraordinary events beyond our control could negatively impact our business.\nOur business and operations could be seriously disrupted and our reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond our control. The occurrence of such extraordinary events, including the emergence of pandemics or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency); persistent or recurring endemics; political discord and civil unrest; terrorist attacks; cyber attacks; war and armed conflict (including but not limited to the Conflict); extreme weather events or other natural disasters; failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data; power, telecommunications or internet outages; or shutdowns of mass transit, could create, and in the case of COVID-19, civil unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022, and the Russia/Ukraine Conflict, have created, and may continue to create, economic, governmental and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including shutdowns of our offices, quarantine, shelter in place and travel limitations) that could impair our ability to operate our business.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and the ongoing endemic might continue to impact the global economy, global financial markets and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created financial disruption and impacted the economies of every country in which we operate. Although financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak signs of underlying economic weakness persist, including elevated levels of market volatility, high unemployment, lack of consumer confidence, depressed levels of business activity in certain sectors, and increased cyber security, information security and operational risks resulting from expansion of remote work. While the health and safety measures initially implemented to address the spread of the pandemic impacted our business, as of the date of this report, we are operating with few COVID-19 related restrictions and the pandemic has become less severe such that we view it as a global endemic to be managed.
