Risk Factors\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by us, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our future operations and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe have in the past incurred significant operating losses and may not sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have in the past experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations. If our revenues decline, our results of operations and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. If we experience slower than anticipated revenue growth or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, we may not be profitable. We may not remain profitable in future periods.\nFluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline.\nGiven the nature of the markets in which we operate, we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results. Factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf demand for and market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;\n\u25cf adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business;\n\u25cf adverse changes in the oil and gas industry on which we are particularly dependent;\n\u25cf changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers;\n\u25cf delays or problems in the introduction of new products;\n\u25cf the announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors;\n\u25cf variations in our product mix;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\u25cf increased costs of raw materials or supplies;\n\u25cf changes in the volume or timing of product orders; and\n\u25cf availability of raw material in a timely manner in periods of disruption such as, but not limited to, COVID-19.\nOur operations are subject to seasonal fluctuation.\nOur TPA business is the least seasonal, however there is a small increase in the spring related to inventory building for the crop season in the United States and a small slowdown in December as oilfield customers run down stock in advance of year end, but otherwise, there is little seasonal variation. We believe we are able to adequately respond to these seasonal fluctuations by reducing or increasing production as needed. The foregoing is equally true of our nitrogen conservation products. The use of our swimming pool products increases in summer months in most markets and results in our sales from January to June being greater than in July through December. Markets for our WATERSAVR\u00ae product are also seasonal, depending on the wet versus dry seasons in particular countries. We attempt to sell into a variety of countries with different seasons on both sides of the equator in order to minimize seasonality.\nInterruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe purchase certain raw materials and components from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time. Because we do not have guaranteed long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers, any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur WATERSAVR\u00ae product has not proven to be a revenue producing product and we may never recoup the cost associated with its development.\nThe marketing efforts of our WATERSAVR\u00ae product may result in continued losses. We introduced our WATERSAVR\u00ae product in June 2002 and, to date, we have delivered quantities for testing by potential customers, but only a few customers have ordered the product for commercial use. This product can achieve success only if it is ordered in substantial quantities by commercial customers who have determined that the water saving benefits of the product exceed the costs of purchase and deployment of the product. We can offer no assurance that we will receive sufficient orders of this product to achieve profits or cover the expenses incurred to manufacture and market this product. We have received National Sanitation Foundation approval for the use WATERSAVR\u00ae in drinking water in the United States. Nevertheless, we may require county or state approval on a case by case basis. We expect to spend $50,000 on the marketing and production of our WATERSAVR\u00ae product in fiscal 2021.\nIf we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer.\nWithout the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf accurately anticipate customer needs;\n\u25cf innovate and develop new products and applications;\n\u25cf successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u25cf price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and\n\u25cf differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products.\nIn developing any new product, we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers\u2019 needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues.\nWe are dependent upon certain customers.\nAmong our current customers, we have identified three that are sizable enough that the loss of any one would be significant. Any loss of one or more of these customers could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales.\nRevenues from shipments made outside of the United States accounted for approximately 32% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020, 45% in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 46% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Since we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a sizable portion of our total revenue. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf differing tax laws and changes in those laws;\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u25cf differing laws regarding protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements; and\n\u25cf impact of the COVID-19 virus\nWe are subject to credit risk and may be subject to substantial write-offs if one or more of our significant customers default on their payment obligations to us.\nWe currently allow our major customers between 30 and 90 days to pay for each sale. This practice, while customary, presents an accounts receivable write-off risk if one or more of our significant customers defaulted on their payment obligations to us. Any such write-off, if substantial, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur products can be hazardous if not handled, stored and used properly; litigation related to the handling, storage and safety of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSome of our products are flammable and must be stored properly to avoid fire risk. Additionally, some of our products may cause irritation to a person\u2019s eyes if they are exposed to the concentrated product. Although we label our products to warn of such risks, our sales could be reduced if our products were considered dangerous to use or if they are implicated in causing personal injury or property damage. We are not currently aware of any circumstances in which our products have caused harm or property damage to consumers. Nevertheless, litigation regarding the handling, storage and safety of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force us to modify our manufacturing processes.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of chemicals. Under such laws, we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of these substances that have been used by our consumers or in our operations. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our competitive position.\nWhile we own certain patents and trademarks, some aspects of our business cannot be protected by patents or trademarks. Accordingly, in these areas there are few legal barriers that prevent potential competitors from copying certain of our products, processes and technologies or from otherwise entering into operations in direct competition with us. In particular, we have been informed that our former exclusive agent for the sale of our products in North America is now competing with us in the swimming pool and personal spa markets. As a former distributor, they were given access to many of our sales, marketing and manufacturing techniques.\nOur products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and resulting claims against us could be costly and prevent us from making or selling certain products.\nThird parties may seek to claim that our products and operations infringe on their patents or other intellectual property rights. We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making, using or selling our products in the United States or internationally.\nA product liability claim for damages could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks. There are many factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, including the failure of our products to work properly and the chance that consumers will use our products incorrectly or for purposes for which they were not intended. There can be no assurance that the amount of product liability insurance that we carry will be sufficient to protect us from product liability claims. A product liability claim in excess of the amount of insurance we carry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees.\nOur business would be adversely affected if the services of Daniel B. O\u2019Brien ceased to be available to us since we currently do not have any other employee with an equivalent level of expertise in and knowledge of our industry. If Mr. O\u2019Brien no longer served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, we would have to recruit one or more new executives, with no real assurance that we would be able to engage a replacement executive with the required skills on satisfactory terms. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in the fields in which we operate. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain qualified employees, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain the services of all our key employees or a sufficient number to execute our plans, nor can there be any assurances that we will be able to continue to attract new employees as required.", "PERMNO": 89597, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "FSI"}
