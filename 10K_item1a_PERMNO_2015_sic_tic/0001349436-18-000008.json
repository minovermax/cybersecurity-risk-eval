Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors that are beyond our control. Declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flow are highly dependent upon the prices we realize from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, the markets for these commodities are very volatile. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs can move quickly and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in regional, domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as perceptions of supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and NGLs generally;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nthe ability of other companies to complete and commission liquefied natural gas export facilities in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nU.S. and worldwide political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe level of global and U.S. inventories;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u2022\nanticipated future prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs, alternative fuels and other commodities;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipeline infrastructure, treating, transportation and refining capacity;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and other extraordinary events;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation and environmental measures; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets, which we expect will continue, make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements with any certainty. For oil, from January 2013 through December 2017, the highest month end NYMEX settled price was $107.65 per Bbl and the lowest was $33.62 per Bbl. For natural gas, from January 2013 through December 2017, the highest month end NYMEX settled price was $5.56 per MMBtu and the lowest was $1.71 per MMBtu. In addition, the market price of natural gas is generally higher in the winter months than during other months of the year due to increased demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the winter season.\nAlthough oil, natural gas and NGL prices rose during 2017, a buildup in inventories, lower global demand, or other factors could cause prices for U.S. oil, natural gas and NGLs to weaken, which could negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations. Under such conditions, revenues may be negatively affected, and the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce economically may be reduced, causing us to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we replace our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current estimated proved reserves and finding or acquiring additional economically recoverable reserves. Declining cash flows from operations, as a result of lower commodity prices, could require us to reduce expenditures to develop and acquire additional reserves. Further, we may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable if dry wells are drilled and if productive wells do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. Furthermore, even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting\nin a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. Decisions to develop properties depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. The estimated cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering or midstream facilities or delays in construction of gathering or midstream facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate electrical infrastructure and water disposal capacity;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events and drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses;\n\u2022\npressures, fires, blowouts and explosions;\n\u2022\nlost or damaged drilling and service tools;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, water or drilling fluids;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as oil spills and natural gas leaks, pipeline or tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nhigh costs, shortages or delivery delays of equipment, labor or other services, or water used in hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions such as extreme cold, fires caused by extreme heat or lack of rain, and severe storms, tornadoes or hurricanes;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas property title problems; and\n\u2022\nmarket and midstream limitations for oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nCertain of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and NGL markets or delay production of oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nMarket conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and NGL markets or delay production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The availability of a ready market for our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and treating facilities for oil, natural gas and NGLs as well as gathering systems, treating facilities and disposal wells for water produced alongside the hydrocarbons. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms in the future or to expand our midstream assets could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to natural gas pipelines, gathering system capacity, treating facilities or disposal wells may be limited or unavailable. We would be unable to realize revenue from any shut-in wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market.\nOur North Park Basin acreage may require the construction of significant gathering systems and pipelines as we increase drilling and development activity. Obtaining these services or expanding our midstream assets with acceptable commercial terms could adversely affect our ability to develop this acreage in a timely manner.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital necessary to drill such locations or construct the midstream infrastructure required to make such development profitable.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering and midstream system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential locations. For example, our North Park Basin assets are in the delineation phase of the development cycle and may require significant investment over the next several years, including the construction of midstream and pipeline takeaway infrastructure, as we progress toward full field development with more activity and an expanded development footprint. We may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital necessary to fully realize our North Park Basin assets.\nIn addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nOur acreage not contained within federal units must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production, and our acreage committed to federal units must be drilled pursuant to the federal unit timelines provided within the unit agreements. In a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nLeases on our oil and natural gas properties that are not federal units typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres, or the leases are renewed. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Acreage committed to federal units must be drilled pursuant to the federal unit timelines provided within the unit agreements, typically requiring two unit wells within the first 5 years and two more wells within the next five years. At the end of the second five-year term the unit begins to reduce in size to designated participating areas within the Federal Units. Unless we increase our current drilling program, we could lose undeveloped acreage through lease expirations. Our reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage and the loss of any leases could materially and adversely affect our ability to so develop such acreage.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Historically, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from asset sales and from the sale of equity and debt securities and cash generated by operations. In particular, cash flow from operations was $181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flow from operations was $65.6 million for the Successor 2016 Period, cash used in operations was $112.1 million for the Predecessor 2016 Period, and cash flow from operations was $373.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The capital markets that we have historically accessed have recently been and may continue to be constrained to such an extent that debt or equity capital raises are practically unfeasible. If the debt and equity capital markets are not accessible, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plans or otherwise carry out our business strategy as expected. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe prices at which oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022\nour capital and operating costs.\nGiven our reduced capital budget for 2018, we are currently estimating a decline in production from approximately 41 MBoe per day to approximately 32 MBoe per day. This decline in production as well as other factors such as lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, declines in reserves, or for any other reason may lead to reductions in our revenues and cash flow from operations and may limit our ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at desired levels. In order to fund capital expenditures, we may seek additional financing.\nDisruptions in the global financial and capital markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of its prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nFuture price declines may result in reductions of the asset carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this accounting method, all costs for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit-of-production method. However, the amount of these costs that can be carried as capitalized assets is subject to a ceiling, which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to proved properties, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or market value of unevaluated properties. The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the most recent 12-month average prices for oil and natural gas, adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Successor Company did not incur any full cost ceiling impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the Successor 2016 Period, the Predecessor 2016 Period and the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred full cost ceiling impairment charges of $319.1 million, $657.4 million and $4.5 billion, respectively. Cumulative full cost ceiling impairment from the Emergence date through December 31, 2016 and 2017 totaled $319.1 million, respectively. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline further in the near term, and without other mitigating circumstances, we may experience additional losses of future net revenues, including losses attributable to quantities that cannot be economically produced at lower prices, which would likely cause us to record additional write-downs of capitalized costs of its oil and natural gas properties and non-cash charges against future earnings. The amount of such future write-downs and non-cash charges could be substantial. Further, the borrowing base under our credit facility is calculated by reference to the value of our oil and natural gas reserves, as determined by the lenders under the credit facility, and declines in the value of such reserves as a result of sustained low commodity prices could reduce the amount available to be borrowed under our credit facility if prices decline from current levels.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. Our current estimates of reserves could change, potentially in material amounts, in the future.\nThe process of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, requiring interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to production rates and economic factors such as historic oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, the assumed effect of governmental regulation and availability of funds for development expenditures. Inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. See \u201cBusiness-Primary Business Operations\u201d in Item 1 of this report for information about our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves will vary and could vary significantly from our estimates shown in this report, which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our assets. In addition, from time to time in the future, we will adjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business and operations could be negatively impacted by shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our board of directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and\nother expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and the loss of senior management or technical personnel or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel, including our director William M. Griffin, Jr., who is serving as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and our Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer Michael A. Johnson, who will be serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. The market for qualified personnel has historically been, and we expect that it will continue to be, intensely competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nThe agreements governing our credit facility have restrictions, financial covenants and borrowing base redeterminations, which could adversely affect our operations.\nThe agreements governing our senior credit facility dated February 10, 2017, (the \u201ccredit facility\u201d) restrict our ability to, among other things, obtain additional financing, incur liens, enter into sale and lease back transactions, make certain investments, lease equipment, merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate with another entity, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock, enter into transactions with our affiliates, create additional subsidiaries, amend or modify certain provisions of our organizational documents, enter into new transactions with our affiliates, sell assets and engage in business combinations. The credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. See additional discussion of the credit facility under \u201cIndebtedness-Credit Facilities.\u201d Persistent depressed oil or natural gas prices or further decline in such prices, without other mitigating circumstances, could prevent us from complying with the financial covenants under the credit facility. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the credit facility or other debt financings could result in a default under those instruments, which, if left uncured, could lead to an event of default. Such an event of default could, among other things, result in all of our existing indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable. Additionally, an event of default under one of our financing instruments could trigger cross-default provisions under our other financing instruments. The application of the remedies under the financing instruments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount. The borrowing base is subject to review semi-annually; however, the lenders reserve the right to have one additional redetermination of the borrowing base per calendar year. Unscheduled redeterminations may be made at our request, but are limited to two requests per year. Borrowing base determinations are based upon proved developed producing reserves, proved developed non-producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. Outstanding borrowings exceeding the borrowing base must be repaid promptly, or we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. The borrowing base is also subject to reductions upon the incurrence of junior debt, hedge terminations, dispositions of assets and casualty events which may require us to repay any deficiencies or pledge additional collateral. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments under the credit facility, which are required, for example, when the committed line of credit is exceeded, proceeds of asset sales in new oil and natural gas properties are not reinvested, or indebtedness that is not permitted by the terms of the credit facility is incurred. If any future indebtedness under our credit facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock in the near future.\nConsideration is continually given to returning capital to our shareholders through dividends or repurchases of our common stock. Points of consideration include our cash balance, projected cash requirements, financial liquidity, trading levels of our common stock, appropriate levels of development activities and other available opportunities. As the oil and gas business is very capital intensive, we have not paid dividends or other distributions on our common stock historically. With the expected significant capital needs in developing our North Park Basin and NW STACK assets, we do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock and do not anticipate we will repurchase shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines are not the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nWe base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on 12-month average index prices and costs, as is required by SEC rules and regulations. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by actual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as other factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of our reserve estimates;\n\u2022\nthe actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, we use a 10% discount factor when calculating discounted future net cash flows, which may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nWe will not know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically producible.\nThe cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive or may suffer from declining production faster than anticipated. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area do not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. During 2017, we completed a total of 23 gross wells, none of which were identified as dry wells. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry wells in our current and future prospects, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business.\nProduction of oil, natural gas and NGLs could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe weather.\nProduction of oil, natural gas and NGLs could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe weather. Repercussions of natural disasters or severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\nevacuation of personnel and curtailment of operations;\n\u2022\ndamage to drilling rigs or other facilities, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver materials to worksites; and\n\u2022\ndamage to, or shutting in of, pipelines and other transportation facilities.\nIn addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water. Regions in which we operate have recently experienced drought conditions. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs.\nThe capital markets could be volatile, and such volatility could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital, cause us to incur additional financing expense or affect the value of certain assets.\nDuring and following the 2008 global financial crisis, financial and capital markets were volatile due to multiple factors, including significant losses in the financial services sector and uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions both in the U.S. and globally. In some cases, financial markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial and/or operating strength. Volatility in the capital markets can significantly increase the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets. Future market volatility, generally, and persistent weakness in commodity prices may adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations or liquidity.\nThese factors may also adversely affect the value of certain of our assets and ability to draw on our credit facility. Adverse credit and capital market conditions may require us to reduce the carrying value of assets associated with derivative contracts to account for non-performance by, or increased credit risk from, counterparties to those contracts. If financial institutions that extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by volatile conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them.\nOur initial technical reviews of properties we acquire are necessarily limited because an in-depth review of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems, such as soil or ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties, and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 30.3% of our total reserves were proved undeveloped reserves. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, recoveries from these fields may not match current expectations. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in the Mid-Continent region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of major geographic areas.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 73.5% of our proved reserves and approximately 92.1% of our annual production was located in the Mid-Continent. This concentration could disproportionately expose us to operational and regulatory risk in these areas. This relative lack of diversification in location of our key operations could expose us to adverse developments in the Mid-Continent or the oil and natural gas markets, including, for example, transportation or treatment capacity constraints, curtailment of production due to weather, electrical outages, treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance, changes in the regulatory environment or other factors. These factors could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows than if our properties were more diversified.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses and reduce earnings.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently have entered, and may in the future enter, into derivative contracts for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production, including fixed price swaps, collars and basis swaps. We have not designated and do not plan to designate any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, record all derivative contracts on our balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts. Derivative contracts also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations; or\n\u2022\nthe actual differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received is materially different from that expected.\nIn addition, these types of derivative contracts can limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.\nOil and natural gas wells are subject to operational hazards that can cause substantial losses for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are a variety of operating risks inherent in oil, natural gas and NGL production and associated activities, such as fires, leaks, explosions, mechanical problems, major equipment failures, blowouts, uncontrollable flow of oil, natural gas and NGLs, water or drilling fluids, casing collapses, abnormally pressurized formations and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these or similar accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs at any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if any of such risks or similar accidents occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life, severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, regulatory investigation and penalties and environmental damage and clean-up responsibility. If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected. While we maintain insurance coverage that we deem appropriate for these risks, our operations may result in liabilities exceeding such insurance coverage or liabilities not covered by insurance.\nShortages or increases in costs of equipment, services and qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Additionally, higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages of field personnel and equipment or price increases could significantly affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans as projected.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also conduct refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas. In addition, the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nA significant aspect of our exploration and development plan involves seismic data. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are present in those structures. Other geologists and petroleum professionals, when studying the same seismic data, may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals. Our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve as a result of using 2-D and 3-D seismic data.\nThe use of 2-D and 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses due to such expenditures. In addition, we may often gather 2-D and 3-D seismic data over large areas in order to help us delineate those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling. Therefore, we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data, and in many cases, we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in such location. If we are not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms, we will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze 2-D and 3-D seismic data without having an opportunity to benefit from those expenditures.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation and treatment operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. As a result of recent incidents involving\nthe release of oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the United States, there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels to restrict oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations. Any increased regulation or suspension of oil and natural gas exploration and production, or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, that arises out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs. Such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the extent we are a shipper on interstate pipelines, we must comply with the FERC-approved tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity.\nLaws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production may also affect production levels. We are required to comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions related to the unitization or pooling of our oil and natural gas properties; the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells; the spacing of wells; and the plugging and abandonment of wells. These and other laws and regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells, limit the number of wells we can drill, or limit the locations at which we can conduct drilling operations.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, may unfavorably impact us, could result in increased operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and rules promulgated thereunder could reduce trading positions in the energy futures or swaps markets and materially reduce hedging opportunities for us, which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows during periods of low commodity prices, and which could adversely affect our ability to restructure hedges when it might be desirable to do so.\nAdditionally, state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may increase capital costs for us and third-party downstream oil and natural gas transporters. These and other potential regulations could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations, increase direct and third-party post production costs or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and which could reduce cash received by or available for distribution, including any amounts paid for transportation on downstream interstate pipelines.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the FERC, the CFTC, or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EPAct 2005 and implementing regulations, the FERC prohibits market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. The CFTC has similar authority under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations it has promulgated thereunder with respect to certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. The FTC also prohibits manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market with respect to sales of commodities, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. These agencies have substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to impose penalties for current violations in excess of $1 million per day for each violation. The FERC has also imposed requirements related to reporting of natural gas sales volumes that may impact the formation of prices indices. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted from time to time. Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations administered by these agencies could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, as described in Item 1. \u201cBusiness- Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\u201d\nOur operations are subject to environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting operations or result in significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge and disposal of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in litigation; the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations; the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects; and the issuance of orders and injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations in affected areas.\nUnder certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, and/or joint and several liability for the investigation, removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled or facilities where\nour petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, to seek damages for contamination, for personal injury, natural resources damage or property damage.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management, or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation or disposal, emission or discharge requirements could require significant expenditures by us to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in the majority of our drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations: issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and additional CAA regulations in June 2016 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; and in June 2016 issued final effluent limitations guidelines under the CWA that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a publicly-owned treatment plant. The EPA also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under TSCA in 2014 regarding reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing, but, to date, has taken no further action. Separately, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016. The June 2016 decision was appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. However, following issuance of a presidential executive order to review rules related to the energy industry, in July 2017, the BLM published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 final rule. In September 2017, the Tenth Circuit issued a ruling to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in light of the BLM\u2019s proposed rulemaking. The BLM issued a final rule repealing the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule in December 2017.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but, at this time, federal legislation related to hydraulic fracturing appears unlikely. In addition, certain states, including Oklahoma and Colorado, have adopted regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or regulate hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the local, state or federal level, fracturing activities with respect to our properties could become subject to additional permit requirements, reporting requirements or operational restrictions, which may result in permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These delays or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas or NGLs that are ultimately produced in commercial quantities from our properties.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity are restricting and could restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater produced alongside our hydrocarbons, which could limit our ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLarge volumes of saltwater produced alongside our oil, natural gas and NGLs in connection with drilling and production operations are disposed of pursuant to permits issued by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities.\nEvaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of saltwater into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where salt water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities, whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, which could negatively affect the economic lives of our properties.\nRefer to \u201c-Environmental Regulations- Subsurface Injections\u201d included in Item 1 of this report for additional discussion of the current and potential impacts of legislation or regulatory initiatives related to seismic activity on the Company.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that the Company produces.\nThe EPA has published its findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment because such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted various rules to address GHG emissions under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from various oil and natural gas operations on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector, including implementation of an LDAR program to minimize methane emissions, under the CAA\u2019s New Source Performance Standards Quad Oa. However, over the past year the EPA has taken several steps to delay implementation of the Quad Oa standards, and the agency proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to stay the requirements for a period of two years and revisit implementation of Quad Oa in its entirety. The EPA has not yet published a final rule but, as a result of these developments, future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time.\nIn addition, in November 2016, the BLM issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands that are substantially similar to the EPA Quad Oa requirements. However, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. While, as a result of these developments, future implementation of the EPA and BLM methane rules is uncertain, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. Moreover, several states, including Colorado, where we operate, have already adopted rules requiring operators of both new and existing sources to develop and implement LDAR program and install devices on certain equipment to capture 95% of methane emissions.\nCompliance with these rules could require us to purchase pollution control equipment, optical gas imaging equipment for LDAR inspections, and to hire additional personnel to assist with inspection and reporting requirements.\nIn addition, there are a number of state and regional efforts that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States was one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to the Paris Agreement. However, the Paris Agreement did not impose any binding obligations on the United States. Moreover, in June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nThe adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to monitor, report and potentially reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, and thus possibly have a material adverse effect on our revenues, as well as having the potential effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, to the extent increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events, such events could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations, and potentially subject us to greater regulation.\nRepercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the United States or its interests abroad may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If events of this nature occur and persist, the attendant political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on prevailing oil and natural gas prices and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas production facilities, transportation systems and storage facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and/or operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our operations is destroyed by such an\nattack. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nOur failure to maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our results.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in our internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and deter and detect any material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent material fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, as further described in Part II \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls and to remediate material weaknesses in our controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, including future compliance with the obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, including those related to acquired businesses, or other effective improvement of our internal controls could harm our operating results. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nNew derivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulatory framework for oversight of derivatives transactions by the CFTC and the SEC. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act subjects certain swap participants to new capital, margin and business conduct standards. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contemplates that where appropriate in light of outstanding exposures, trading liquidity and other factors, swaps (broadly defined to include most hedging instruments other than futures) will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, unless the \u201cend-user\u201d exception from clearing applies. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a new Energy and Environmental Markets Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the CFTC regarding matters of concern to exchanges, firms, end users and regulators with respect to energy and environmental markets and also expands the CFTC\u2019s power to impose position limits on specific categories of swaps (excluding swaps entered into for bona fide hedging purposes).\nThere are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. However, although we may qualify for exceptions, our derivatives counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nThe future of the CFTC's rulemaking remains uncertain under the new presidential administration. Recent rule proposals by the CFTC suggest that final consideration of major proposed rules will be made by the new administration. During the last quarter of 2016, the CFTC decided to re-propose, rather than finalize, certain regulations, including (a) limitations on speculative futures and swap positions, (b) regulations on automated trading algorithms and (c) limitations on swap capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants. In December 2016, the Chairman of the CFTC stated that the CFTC decided to re-propose, rather than finalize, the above regulations, in part based on the uncertainty over the next presidential administration. It\nis also uncertain whether the current Chairman of the CFTC and other CFTC staff will remain with the CFTC under the new presidential administration. The current Chairman's term expires in April 2017, and two seats are currently open for new appointees, leaving the CFTC's future rulemaking unclear.\nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or IT systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations.\nIn recent years, we have increasingly relied on information technology systems and networks in connection with our business activities, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We rely on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to, among other things, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, analyze seismic and drilling information, process and record financial and operating data and communicate with employees and third parties. As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the physical security of our employees and assets. We have experienced, and expect to continue to confront, attempts from hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. Although prior cyber-attacks have not had a material adverse impact on our operations or financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effect. Any cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. Cyber-attacks or security breaches also could result in litigation or regulatory action, as well as significant additional expense to implement further data protection measures.\nIn addition to the risks presented to our systems and networks, cyber-attacks affecting oil and natural gas distribution systems maintained by third parties, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could delay or prevent delivery of our production to markets. A cyber-attack of this nature would be outside our control, but could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Relating to Our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial performance.\nOur capital structure was significantly impacted by the Plan of Reorganization (as defined below). Under fresh-start reporting rules that applied to us upon the Emergence Date, assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero. Accordingly, because fresh-start reporting rules applied, our financial condition and results of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our common stock.\nAs of the date of filing this report, we have outstanding Warrants (as defined in Part IV. Note 1 - Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings) to purchase approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock at average exercise prices of either $41.34 and $42.03 per share. In addition, we have as of the date of this report, 3.0 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the SandRidge Energy, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the, \u201cOmnibus Incentive Plan\u201d). The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, the Warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such options or the Warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of the Warrants and any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan in the future.", "PERMNO": 92421, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SD"}
