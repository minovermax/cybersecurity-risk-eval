These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The risks that are discussed below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions\nOur sales, profitability, operating results and cash flows are sensitive to global, regional, or industry economic conditions, financial markets and cyclicality, and could be adversely affected during economic downturns or financial market instability.\nThe business of our customers can be cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general, regional, or industry economic conditions. Deterioration in our customers\u2019 financial position can adversely affect our sales and profitability. Historically, downturns in general, regional, or industry economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, either generally or within a certain region or industry, as the case may be, and we may experience similar problems in the future. Recent global economic conditions have caused, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit, substantial reductions and fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, and concerns that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary or slow growth period, each of which may materially adversely affect our customers\u2019 access to capital. Turbulent global economic conditions or significant changes in conditions pertaining to a certain region or industry, even without a sustained downturn, may limit our customers\u2019 access to capital or otherwise impair their creditworthiness, which could inhibit their ability to purchase our products or affect their ability to pay for products that they have already purchased from us. Such challenges can affect our ability to collect customer receivables on the intended terms and amounts. In addition, downturns in our customers\u2019 industries, such as the oil and gas industry, even during periods of generally strong general economic conditions, could adversely affect our sales, profitability, operating results and cash flows.\nAlthough no one customer currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales, we are exposed to certain industries such as mobility, oil and gas, appliances and construction. Economic challenges which more significantly affect such particular industries may directly reduce demand for our products by customers within such industries. Financial difficulties or significant production slowdowns by major original equipment manufacturers (\"OEM\") could have a cascading effect on a group of our customers who supply to OEMs, directly affecting their ability to pay. Similarly, financial difficulties or significant production slowdowns by\nmajor upstream producers who use our products or have customers that use their products, could directly affect their ability to pay and have a cascading effect on the Company.\nSimilar to our customers\u2019 situation, turbulent global economic conditions, even without a sustained downturn, may materially adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and liquidity with which they maintain their inventories, production levels and product quality, causing them to raise prices or lower production levels. An increase in prices could adversely affect our profitability, operating results and cash flows.\nThe future of the global economic and financial condition is difficult to forecast and mitigate, and therefore the impact on our operating results for a particular period is difficult to predict. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative global financial or credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nUnstable conditions in the financial or credit markets or sustained poor financial performance may adversely impact our ability to access credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. A volatile credit market may limit our ability to replace maturing credit facilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business. Accordingly, we may be required to enter into credit agreements that have terms that we do not prefer, which could require us to pay unattractive interest rates. This could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nThere can be no assurances that government responses to disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit. Long term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding sources can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring, eliminating or reducing capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nShortages or changes in the price of raw materials and energy costs could adversely affect operating results and financial condition.\nWe purchase various plastic resins to produce our proprietary plastic formulations. These resins, derived from petroleum or natural gas, have on occasion been subject to periods of short supply as well as rapid and significant movements in price. These fluctuations in supply and price may be caused or intensified by a number of factors, including inclement weather, political instability or hostilities in oil-producing countries, other force majeure events affecting the production facilities of our suppliers, and more general supply and demand changes. We may not be able to obtain sufficient raw materials or pass on increases in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers. Such shortages or higher petroleum or natural gas costs could lead to declining margins, operating results and financial conditions.\nAn unanticipated increase in demand may result in the inability to meet customer needs and loss of sales.\nIf we experience an unforeseen increase in demand, we may have difficulty meeting our supply obligations to our customers due to limited capacity or delays from our suppliers. We may lose sales as a result of not meeting the demands of our customers in the timeline required and our results of operations may be adversely affected. We may be required to change suppliers or may need to outsource our operations where possible and, if so, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with our high quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines.\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters, contagious diseases, political disruptions, domestic and international terrorist attacks and acts of war, could disrupt commerce and significantly decrease demand for our products.\nExtraordinary events, including natural disasters, contagious diseases, political disruptions, domestic and international terrorist attacks and acts of war could adversely affect the economy generally, our business and operations specifically, and the demand for our products. The occurrence of extraordinary events cannot be predicted and their occurrence could adversely affect our results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business outside of the United States. We expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and profitability due to volatility in U.S. dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency;\n\u2022\npotential disruption that could be caused with the partial or complete reconfiguration of the European Union;\n\u2022\nintellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;\n\u2022\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur;\n\u2022\nagreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes may occur in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries and economic downturns in any particular country or region may have cascading adverse impacts on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in other countries or regions;\n\u2022\nforeign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may nationalize private enterprises;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may enact tax law changes to increase revenue;\n\u2022\nour business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic, country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities, such as the imposition of economic sanctions or other measures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated geopolitical and other events, such as economic sanctions, could adversely impact our business and profitability in the country being sanctioned and retaliatory actions by such countries may also adversely impact the countries imposing the sanctions which could result in a write-down of some of our international investments.\nOur continued success as a global supplier will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business.\nAlthough the majority of our international business operations are currently in regions where the risk level and established legal systems are considered reasonable, our international business also includes projects in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist. We emphasize compliance with the law and have policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of employees with regard to business ethics and key legal requirements such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which we refer to as the FCPA; however, there can be no certain assurances that our employees or outside agents will adhere to our code of business conduct, other internal policies or the FCPA. Additionally, in such high risk regions, our competitors who may not be subject to U.S. laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards, licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain internal accounting practices to accurately record our international transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of these laws could result in significant monetary or criminal penalties for\npotential violations of the FCPA or other laws or regulations which, in turn, could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to hazards and other risks associated with polymer processing production and the related storage and transportation of inventories, products and wastes.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to the potential hazards and risks associated with polymer production and the related storage and transportation of inventories and wastes, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. These hazards, and their consequences, could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties.\nWe face competition from other polymer companies, which could adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, competing against a number of domestic and foreign polymer producers on a variety of key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, pricing strategies, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors\u2019 pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors.\nWe expect that our competitors will continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of our products. In addition, our competitors could lower prices which would cause a reduction in the selling prices of some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers. An inability to compete successfully could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may also experience increased competition from companies that offer products based on alternative technologies and processes that may be more competitive or better in price or performance, causing us to lose customers which would result in a decline in our sales volume and earnings.\nWe are dependent upon good relationships with our various suppliers, vendors and distributors.\nWe rely upon good relationships with a number of different suppliers, vendors and distributors. If our relationships with these parties were to deteriorate or if a number of these parties should elect to discontinue doing business with us, our business operations could be adversely affected. Failure of counterparties to perform under the terms and conditions of contractual arrangements may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize new products, our business operations would be adversely affected.\nSuccessful development and commercialization of new products is a key driver in our anticipated growth plans. Also, on an ongoing basis a certain portion of our products slowly become obsolete or commoditized and, therefore, new products are necessary to maintain current volumes. The development and commercialization of new products requires significant investments in research and development, production, and marketing. The successful production and commercialization of these products is uncertain as is the acceptance of the new products in the marketplace. If we fail to successfully develop and commercialize new products, or if customers decline to purchase the new products, we will not be able to recover our development investment, which can be substantial in our Engineered Composites and Engineered Plastics businesses, and the growth prospects and overall demand for our products will be adversely affected.\nAn impairment of goodwill and other assets would negatively impact our financial results.\nAt least annually, we perform an impairment test for goodwill. Under current accounting guidance, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value with a charge against earnings. As of August 31, 2016, our goodwill balance was $257.8 million after recognition of an impairment charge of $360.7 million during fiscal 2016. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAdditionally, we review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized an impairment charge of $41.0 million related to our long-lived assets. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition, and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of long-lived assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team or employee base could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel.\nOur business depends upon good relations with our employees.\nWe may experience difficulties in maintaining appropriate relations with unions and employees in certain locations. About 30% of our employees are represented by labor unions primarily outside of the United States. In addition, problems or changes affecting employees in certain locations may affect relations with our employees at other locations. The risk of labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production could adversely affect us. If we cannot successfully negotiate or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, or if negotiations take an excessive amount of time, there may be a heightened risk of a prolonged work stoppage. Work stoppages may be caused by the inability of national unions and the governments of countries that the Company operates in from reaching agreement, and are outside the control of the Company. Any work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a manufacturing facility or on our operations as a whole.\nA major failure or breach of our information systems could harm our business.\nWe currently depend upon numerous local and several regionally integrated information systems to process orders, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, maintain cost-efficient operations, prepare financial information and reports, and operate our website. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary. We continually review our global information system options to help strengthen common business practices, improve operational efficiency, reduce risk and drive cost savings.\nWhile we have a comprehensive security program that is continuously reviewed and upgraded, we may experience operating problems with our information systems as a result of system security failures such as viruses, cyber-attacks, breaches or other causes. Any system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. Theft of sensitive data and our inability to protect trade secrets and personal identifiable information of our employees, customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, customers, suppliers and employees. Additionally, any significant disruption or slowdown of our current or future information systems as a result of a system security failure could disrupt the flow of operational information, cause orders to be lost or delayed and could damage our reputation with our customers or cause our customers to cancel orders, any of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOther increases in operating costs could affect our profitability.\nScheduled or unscheduled maintenance programs could cause significant production outages, higher costs and/or reduced production capacity at our suppliers due to the industry in which they operate. These events could also affect our future profitability.\nAlthough our pension and postretirement plans currently meet all applicable minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business.\nWe have several defined benefit pension and postretirement plans around the world in which a portion of our employees participate in. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries\u2019 benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by our outside actuaries and as required by law. The amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. Specifically, if year-end accumulated obligations exceed assets, we may elect to make a voluntary contribution, over and above the minimum required. These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business.\nIncreasing cost of employee healthcare may decrease our profitability.\nThe cost of providing healthcare coverage for our employees is a significant operating cost for the Company. If healthcare costs increase at a rapid pace, we may not be able to or willing to pass on those costs to employees. Therefore, if we are unable to offset rising healthcare costs through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, the increased costs of employee healthcare may result in declining margins and operating results.\nRisks Associated With Restructuring Initiatives\nThe inability to achieve, delays in achieving or achievement of less than the anticipated financial benefit from initiatives related to cost reductions and improving efficiencies could adversely affect our profitability.\nFrom time to time, we undertake plans and initiatives that are expected to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. We could be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, some or all of the benefits from such initiatives because of limited resources or uncontrollable economic conditions. If these initiatives are not as successful as planned, the result could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, even if we achieve these goals, we may not receive the expected benefits of the initiatives, or the costs of implementing these initiatives could exceed the related benefits.\nWe may incur significant charges in the event we close or relocate all or part of a manufacturing facility.\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one facility to another facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing facility. The closure or relocation of all or part of a manufacturing facility could create unintended challenges with production quality and result in future charges which could be significant.\nRisks Associated With Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nDuring the past several fiscal years, we have acquired multiple businesses, including most recently Citadel, and we may continue to acquire other businesses, intended to complement or expand our business. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both the Company and the acquisitions. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily exit the Company because of the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour management team may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired operations into our operations and management and achieving intended levels of manufacturing quality;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nthe ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nintegration may be more costly or more time consuming and complex or simply less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud; and\n\u2022\nthe acquired operations may not otherwise perform as expected or provide expected results.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results after the acquisition.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures, which could reduce our anticipated profitability.\nWe expect that our acquisitions will result in certain synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects, although we may not realize these expected synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects. We may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities including successfully developing new geographic or product markets or retaining acquired current customers. Our assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for acquired businesses may be different from the strategies that the acquired companies pursued. If these factors limit our ability to integrate or operate the acquired companies successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies expected to result from acquisitions, may not be met.\nFrom time to time, we may divest certain businesses, product lines or assets, both acquired or otherwise, that are no longer strategically important, or we may exit minority investments, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. If we decide to divest a business, product line or assets, we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the business, product line or assets that we want to dispose of, or we may dispose of the business, product line or assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated.\nWe may experience difficulties in completing intended acquisitions, divestitures, and new ventures, particularly those in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe may acquire other businesses, divest certain businesses, or form new ventures intended to complement or expand our business, both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, although, we may experience delays and other challenges in completing such acquisitions, divestitures and ventures within our anticipated time frames which are difficult to predict, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. If such acquisitions, divestitures or ventures are not completed within anticipated time frames, or are not completed successfully, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nExtensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations impact our operations and assets, and compliance, or lack of compliance, with these regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations on and ownership of real property are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at the national, state and local governmental levels. The nature of our business exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, transportation, recycling or disposal and/or sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if they are released into the environment or workplace. Environmental laws may have a significant effect on the costs of these activities involving inventory and wastes. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations of these laws.\nAlso, national and state environmental statutes impose strict, and under some circumstances, joint and several liability for the cost of investigations and remedial actions on any company that generated the waste, arranged for disposal of the waste, transported the waste to the disposal site or selected the disposal site, as well as on the owners and operators of these sites. Any or all of the responsible parties may be required to bear all of the costs of clean up, regardless of fault or legality of the waste disposal or ownership of the site, and may also be subject to liability for natural resource damages. It is possible that we could be identified as a potentially responsible party at various sites in the future, which could result in being assessed substantial investigation or clean-up costs.\nAccruals for estimated costs, including, among other things, the ranges associated with our accruals for future environmental compliance and remediation may be too low or we may not be able to quantify the potential costs. We may be subject to additional environmental liabilities or potential liabilities that have not yet been identified. We expect that we will continue to be subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations may, but does not currently, require significant capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary information.\nWe have numerous patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and tradenames, which are discussed under ITEM 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Despite our efforts to protect our trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, other parties, including our former employees or consultants, may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our proprietary information or marks without our authorization. Unauthorized use of our trademarks or tradenames, or unauthorized use or disclosure of our other intellectual property, could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nChanges to tax laws, rules and regulations, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or other domestic or foreign governmental bodies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional compliance costs and tax liabilities which could have an adverse impact on our earnings. For example, recent broad proposals for reform of longstanding corporate tax principles, including proposals included in the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, if finalized and adopted, could materially affect our global tax rate and result in increased compliance.\nLitigation from customers, employees or others could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if these claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect market perception of the Company and our products. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also incur costs in connection with defending these possible claims and legal actions.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that, if not properly corrected, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\", we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of August 31, 2016 because material weaknesses existed in our information technology applications at certain of our acquired Citadel locations and our European shared service center, specifically related to segregation of duties and certain controls not operating effectively within the procure to pay and revenue processes. If we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor, supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information and/or the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may be required to adopt accounting or financial reporting standards and the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe will be required to adopt new or modified accounting or financial reporting standards that are different than current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The impact and cost of implementation of new standards could impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nOur current debt position could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAfter completing the Citadel acquisition in fiscal 2015, the Company has significant debt service obligations. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has outstanding debt of $955.0 million. Our current debt position could have significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the product categories in which we participate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe expect to pay current operating expenses and to pay principal and interest on current and future debt obligations from cash provided by operating activities. Therefore, our ability to meet these payment obligations will depend on future financial performance and regional cash availability, which is subject in part to numerous economic, business and financial factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, limit payment of dividends of both common and convertible special stock, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt.\nDespite our intentions to reduce debt, we may still be required to incur additional debt. Incurring more debt could increase the risks associated with our current financial position.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future if a financing need arises and other forms of funding, such as equity, are not available to the Company. The terms of the indenture and the credit agreement will restrict, but will not completely prohibit, us from doing so. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has $279.1 million of undrawn availability under the revolving credit facility, all of which would be secured debt. In addition, the indenture will allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances, which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors. The indenture will also allow us to incur certain other additional secured debt. The indenture will allow our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which will include our foreign subsidiaries, to incur additional debt, which debt (as well as other liabilities at any such subsidiary) would be structurally senior to the notes. In addition, the indenture will not prevent us from incurring certain other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness (as defined in the indenture). If debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nIf we default under the senior secured credit facility or the senior notes, we may not be able to service our debt obligations.\nIn the event of a default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, thereby permitting an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the notes, we may not be able to repay the amounts due under the senior secured credit facility, or the notes. This could have serious consequences to the holders of the notes and to our financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nAs of August 31, 2016, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of $35.3 million. In addition, we have access to a revolving credit facility of $300.0 million, with $279.1 million available as of August 31, 2016. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the notes, and to fund working capital, planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds sought from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, the agreements governing the term loans, the revolving credit facility and the indenture will limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe could incur additional interest expense if we are not able to register our $375 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 in a timely manner.\nOn May 26, 2015, the Company issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes were sold on May 26, 2015 in a private transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") for 540 days from issuance. If the Notes have not been registered by the 540th day, the Company will incur additional interest expense in the amount of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any Registration Default. Additional interest expense shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period, but in no event shall the aggregate increase in such annual interest rate exceed 1.00%. As of August 31, 2016, the Notes had not been registered under the Securities Act. The Company expects to file for registration shortly after the filing of the 10-K.", "PERMNO": 69199, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "SHLM"}
