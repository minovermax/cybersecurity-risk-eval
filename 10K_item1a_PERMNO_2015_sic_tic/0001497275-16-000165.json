{"cik": "1497275", "company": "STATE BANK FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to certain risks, including those described below. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. More detailed information concerning these risks is contained in other sections of this report, including \"Business\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in an increase to our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic recession or other economic problems, including those affecting our Georgia markets, but also those affecting the U.S. or world economies, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services. Since the conclusion of the last recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain above pre-recession levels. In addition, while real estate values have rebounded somewhat following the recession the collateral values of the real estate supporting many commercial and home mortgages are less than the value at loan origination and could decline further.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, or if there are negative developments affecting the domestic and international credit markets, the value of our loans and investments may be harmed, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nAn adverse change in real estate market values may result in losses and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 86.6% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each loan provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. At December 31, 2015, approximately 59.8% of our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by commercial real estate, comprising $1.3 billion of total loans.\nA decline in real estate values could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts we receive on the sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. As a result, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. There are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. There is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our historical growth has been a result of acquisitions of other financial institutions and we intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our strategy may be lost. If we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we must generally satisfy a number of conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including certain bank regulatory approvals, which have become substantially more difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable as a result of the recent financial crisis. Additionally, any future acquisitions may not produce the revenue, earnings or synergies that we anticipated. As our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio, which produces substantially higher yields than our organic and purchased non-credit impaired loan portfolios, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $49.8 million of accretion income, or 31.4% of our total interest income for the year, from the realization of accretable discounts on our purchased credit impaired loans, partially offset by $16.5 million of amortization expense on the FDIC receivable (which receivable was eliminated following the termination of our loss share agreements). If we are unable to replace our purchased credit impaired loans and the related accretion with a significantly higher level of new performing loans and other earning assets due to our inability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, a decline in loan demand, competition from other financial institutions in our markets, stagnation or continued deterioration of economic conditions, or other conditions, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic growth plan contemplates additional acquisitions, which could expose us to additional risks.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity.\nOur acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management's attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations; and\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nWe may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired institutions into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our acquisition activities.\nWe may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our acquisition activities. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired institution. In addition, the markets in which we and our potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. We may lose existing customers, or the customers of an acquired institution, as a result of an acquisition. We also may lose key personnel from the acquired institution as a result of an acquisition. We may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining an institution for acquisition during the due diligence period. These factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences. Undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition could bring civil, criminal and financial liabilities against us, our management and the management of the institutions we acquire. In addition, if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process, the economic benefits expected to result from acquisitions might not occur. Failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, or our ability to implement our strategy, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all.\nLack of seasoning of our organic loan portfolio may increase the risk of credit defaults in the future.\nWe have significantly grown our organic loan portfolio over the past several years. Due to this rapid growth, a large portion of our organic loan portfolio and of our lending relationships are of relatively recent origin. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process we refer to as \u201cseasoning.\u201d As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because a significant majority of our organic loan portfolio is relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults in our organic loan portfolio may not be representative of the level that will prevail when the portfolio becomes more seasoned, which may be higher than current levels. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, as a result, we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our earnings depend significantly on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience \"gaps\" in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates move contrary to our position, this \"gap\" may work against us, and our earnings may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect our current borrowers' ability to repay variable rate loans, the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in the general level of market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Adverse changes in the U.S. monetary policy or in economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect our business. We also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nAny expansion into new lines of business might not be successful\nAs part of our ongoing strategic plan, we will continue to consider expansion into new lines of business through the acquisition of third parties, including our acquisition of the equipment finance origination platform of Patriot Capital Corporation in October 2015, or through organic growth and development. There are substantial risks associated with such efforts, including risks that (a) revenues from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, compliance, and other implementation costs, (b) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, and (c) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. Furthermore, it is possible that our unfamiliarity with new lines of business might adversely affect the success of such actions. If any such expansions into new product markets are not successful, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our management team, and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees could impair our relationship with customers and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service and skills of our existing senior executive management team, as well as other key employees with long-term customer relationships. Our growth strategy is built primarily on our ability to retain employees with experience and business relationships within their respective segments. The loss of one or more of these key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, among others. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. Our failure to comply with these requirements can lead to, among other remedies, administrative enforcement actions, termination or suspension of our licenses, rights of rescission for borrowers, and class action lawsuits. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public and the FDIC rather than our shareholders. The burden of regulatory compliance has increased under current legislation and banking regulations and is likely to continue to have or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry. Recent legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes in regulatory enforcement policies and capital adequacy guidelines, are increasing our costs of doing business and, as a result, may create an advantage for our competitors who may not be subject to similar legislative and regulatory requirements. In addition, future regulatory changes, including changes to regulatory capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on our future results. Furthermore, the federal and state bank regulatory authorities who supervise us have broad discretionary powers to take enforcement actions against banks for failure to comply with applicable regulations and laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions that have a material adverse effect on our future results.\nThis and other potential changes in government regulation or policies could increase our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our operations and the manner in which we conduct our business.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may have a material effect on our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. Although the full impact of the new requirements on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities. The Dodd-Frank Act has required that we develop new and more extensive compliance policies and practices, and maintain higher capital and liquidity levels. These and other changes may adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make changes necessary to comply with these requirements at the expense of normal business operations. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new regulatory capital rules based on the international standards, known as Basel III, that had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The new rules raised the risk-based capital requirements and revised the methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, usually resulting in higher risk weights. The new rules became effective as applied to the Company and State Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III-based rules increase capital requirements and include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out of CET1 over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nBeginning on January 1, 2015, our Basel III-based minimum risk-based capital requirements were (i) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. As of January 1, 2016, our capital conservation buffer is 0.625%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the final rules results in higher regulatory capital standards, it is not expected to significantly impact the Company and State Bank as our current capital levels far exceed those required under the new rules.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increased the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the former requirement of 100%. We will also be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. All changes to the risk weights took effect in full in 2015.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The Company and State Bank entered into a Capital Maintenance Agreement with the FDIC, which requires State Bank to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 10% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12% through July 2016.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nThe federal banking agencies have proposed new liquidity standards that could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business lines by forcing us to seek new sources of liquidity for them, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nAs part of the Basel III capital process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a new liquidity standard, a liquidity coverage ratio, which requires a banking organization to hold sufficient \u201chigh quality liquid assets\u201d to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario, as well as a net stable funding ratio, which imposes a similar requirement over a one-year period. The U.S. banking regulators have proposed a liquidity coverage ratio for systemically important banks. Although the proposal would not apply directly to us, the substance of the proposal may inform the regulators\u2019 assessment of our liquidity. We could be required to reduce our holdings of illiquid assets which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. regulators have not yet proposed a net stable funding ratio requirement.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards and this continued investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses with respect to our loan portfolio, in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic conditions and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan and lease losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan and lease losses was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair values are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by construction and development, other commercial real estate, and commercial, financial and agricultural lending.\nConstruction and development, commercial real estate, and commercial, financial and agricultural lending usually involve higher credit risks than single-family residential lending. At December 31, 2015, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio: real estate construction and development - 23.9%, other commercial real estate - 35.9%, and commercial, financial and agricultural - 9.1%.\nRisk of loss on a construction and development loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder's ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nOther commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower's ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nCommercial, financial and agricultural loans are typically based on the borrowers' ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the assets securing the loans have the following characteristics: (a) they depreciate over time, (b) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (c) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nConstruction and development loans, other commercial real estate loans, and commercial, financial and agricultural loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, our outstanding commercial real estate loans were equal to 282.8% of the Bank's total risk-based capital. The banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for loan losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nDuring 2015, the banking regulators issued several warnings about higher credit risk in commercial lending, particularly in commercial real estate loans.\nWe face additional risks due to our increase in mortgage banking activities that could negatively impact our net income and profitability.\nWe acquired mortgage banking operations in our acquisitions of Bank of Atlanta and First Bank of Georgia, which in addition to our legacy mortgage banking operations expose us to risks that are different from our retail and commercial banking operations. During higher and rising interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity tends to decline, which can lead to reduced volumes of business and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. While we have been experiencing historically low interest rates, the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking operations also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. If our level of mortgage production\ndeclines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations. In addition, mortgages sold to third-party investors are typically subject to certain repurchase provisions related to borrower refinancing, defaults, fraud or other reasons stipulated in the applicable third-party investor agreements. If the fair value of a loan when repurchased is less than the fair value when sold, we may be required to charge such shortfall to earnings.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks.\nAs noted above, our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients' devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients' confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients' or other third parties' business operations. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, and other third parties could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to retain or develop a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong deposit base. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, our cost of funds will increase, adversely affecting the ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations, reducing net interest margin and negatively affecting results of operations. We derive liquidity through core deposit growth, maturity of money market investments, and maturity and sale of investment securities and loans. Additionally, we have access to financial market borrowing sources on an unsecured and a collateralized basis for both short-term and long-term purposes including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks, of which we are a member. If these funding sources are not sufficient or available, we may have to acquire funds through higher-cost sources.\nChanges in local economic conditions where we operate could have a negative effect.\nOur success depends significantly on growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets in Georgia. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant effect on our loans, the ability of borrowers to repay our loans, and the value of the collateral securing our loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the Southeastern United States in general or any one or more of our local markets could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and our profitability. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans that we make, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nWe face strong competition for customers, which could prevent us from obtaining customers or may cause us to pay higher interest rates to attract customer deposits.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor's new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, this competitive industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions, such as SunTrust Bank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and BB&T. We also compete with regional and local community banks in our market. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our market, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us.\nFuture growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations and any future growth.\nOur ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control and largely do not depend on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to operate or further expand our operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches. These restrictions may also result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as State Bank, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution's deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution's risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. As a result of recent FDIC assessment charges, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank's average consolidated total assets less the sum of its average tangible equity, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments, which increase or decrease a bank's overall assessment rate. This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than the recent levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nAny deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect us, including resulting in material misstatements in our financial statements, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our operating results could be harmed and it could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in the future. Inferior controls and procedures or the identification of additional accounting errors could cause our investors to lose confidence in our internal controls and question our reported financial information, which, among other things, could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a higher risk of shareholder litigation, which could result in significant additional expenses and require additional financial and management resources.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \"critical\" because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sanctions that the regulators have imposed on banks that have not complied with all requirements have been especially severe. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nWe will have to respond to future technological changes. Specifically, if our competitors introduce new banking products and services embodying new technologies, or if new banking industry standards and practices emerge, then our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may be impaired or become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, then we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nWe are subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical record-keeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of our Acquired Banks\nWe are subject to risks related to our acquisition transactions.\nThe ultimate success of our past acquisition transactions and any acquisitions (whether FDIC-assisted or unassisted transactions) in which we may participate in the future, will depend on a number of factors, including our ability:\n\u2022\nto fully integrate, and to integrate successfully, the branches acquired into our operations;\n\u2022\nto limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (loans) acquired;\n\u2022\nto retain existing deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired banks;\n\u2022\nto effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence;\n\u2022\nto control the incremental noninterest expense from the acquired operations in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nto retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired operations;\n\u2022\nto earn acceptable levels of interest and noninterest income, including fee income, from the acquired operations; and\n\u2022\nto reasonably estimate cash flows for acquired loans to mitigate exposure greater than estimated losses at the time of acquisition.\nAs with any acquisition involving a financial institution there may be higher than average levels of service disruptions that would cause inconveniences to our new or existing customers or potentially increase the effectiveness of competing financial institutions in attracting our customers. We anticipate challenges and opportunities because of the unique nature of each acquisition. Integration efforts will also likely divert our management's attention and resources. We may be unable to integrate acquired branches or their personnel successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition transactions. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, we may be unable to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, to compete effectively in the market areas previously served by the acquired branches or to manage effectively any growth resulting from our acquisition transactions.\nThe accounting for loans acquired in connection with our acquisitions is based on numerous subjective determinations that may prove to be inaccurate and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe loans we acquired in connection with our acquisitions have been recorded at their estimated fair value on the respective acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. In general, the determination of estimated fair value of acquired loans requires management to make subjective determinations regarding discount rate, estimates of losses on defaults, market conditions and other factors that are highly subjective in nature. Although we have recorded fair value adjustments based on our estimates at the date of acquisition, the loans we acquired may become impaired or may further deteriorate in value, resulting in additional losses and charge-offs to the loan portfolio. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio and consequently reduce our capital. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nLoans we acquired in connection with acquisitions that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, or ASC 310-30. These purchased credit impaired loans, like purchased non-credit impaired loans, acquired in connection with our acquisitions, have been recorded at their estimated fair value on the respective acquisition date, based on subjective determinations regarding risk ratings, expected future cash flows and fair value of the underlying collateral, without a carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. We evaluate these loans quarterly to assess expected cash flows. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of any previously-recorded provision for loan and lease losses and related allowance for loan and lease losses, and then as a prospective increase in the accretable discount on the purchased credit impaired loans. Because the accounting for these loans is based on subjective measures that can change frequently, we may experience fluctuations in our net interest income and provisions for loan losses attributable to these loans. These fluctuations could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, although we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC that provided that the FDIC would bear a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in connection with our FDIC-assisted failed bank transactions, as of December 31, 2015, all of our loss share agreements had been terminated. Therefore, any future losses on formerly covered loans are no longer eligible for reimbursement from the FDIC, and any such charge-offs would negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are subject to dilution.\nAt February 25, 2016, we had 37,052,008 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, warrants outstanding to purchase another 172,745 shares of our common stock, and options to purchase 28,918 shares of our common stock. Our outstanding shares of common stock include 980,186 shares of restricted stock. In addition, we have 1,968,525 unallocated shares under our 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended, that remain available for future grants. If we issue additional shares of common stock in the future and do not issue those shares to all then-existing common shareholders proportionately to their interests, the issuance will result in dilution to each shareholder by reducing the shareholder's percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\ndowngrades in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, shareholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and harm our business or results of operations.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our common shareholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which no preferred shares are issued or outstanding. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine:\n\u2022\nthe designation of, and the number of, shares constituting each series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nthe dividend rate for each series;\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of any voting, conversion and exchange rights for each series;\n\u2022\nthe amounts payable on each series on redemption or our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of any sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of any series; and\n\u2022\nthe preferences and the relative rights among the series of preferred stock.\nWe could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock and with preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nOur securities are not FDIC-insured.\nOur securities, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of the Bank, are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC or any other governmental agency and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.", "PERMNO": 12696, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STBZ"}
