{"cik": "57528", "company": "SNYDER'S-LANCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks related to our Merger with Campbell\nThe failure to complete or delays in completing the merger with Campbell could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nConsummation of the merger with Campbell is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by our shareholders. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfactorily met or validly waived, or that our Company and Campbell will be able to successfully consummate the Merger, on the anticipated terms or at all. We will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources and transaction-related expenses for which we will receive little or no benefit, if the Merger is not consummated. Additionally, we may be required, in certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $149 million, as provided in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the merger is not completed on or September 18, 2018. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for both us and Campbell. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity. Any of these events, individually or in combination, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe pending merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations, including our relationships with customers, vendors and employees.\nThe proposed merger with Campbell could cause material disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business. This could affect our relationships with customers, vendors and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. In particular, we could lose important personnel if some employees decide to leave in light of the proposed Merger. We could potentially lose customers or suppliers, or our customers or suppliers could modify their relationships with us in an adverse manner. In addition, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant management resources to complete the Merger. This may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nThe Merger Agreement also places restrictions on how we conduct our business before the merger is completed. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively, and in a timely manner, to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities. This could harm our business, financial results and operations.\nRisks related to our business\nOur performance may be impacted by general economic conditions or an economic downturn.\nAn overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending as consumers make decisions on what to include in their food budgets. This could also result in a shift in consumer preference toward private label products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers that may require us to increase promotional spending or reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could lower our revenue and profitability.\nInstability in financial markets may impact our ability, or increase the cost, to enter into new credit agreements in the future. Additionally, it may weaken the ability of our customers, suppliers, IBOs, third-party distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business partners to perform their obligations in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason, our business could be negatively impacted.\nVolatility in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on, including raw materials, packaging, energy and labor, could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and packaging. While we often obtain substantial commitments for future delivery of certain raw materials, continued long-term increases in the costs of raw materials and packaging, including but not limited to cost increases due to the tightening of supply, could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur transportation and logistics system is dependent upon gasoline and diesel fuel, and our manufacturing operations depend on natural gas. While we may enter into forward purchase contracts to reduce the volatility associated with some of these costs, continued long-term changes in the cost or availability of these energy sources could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur continued growth requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\nWe operate in the highly competitive food industry.\nPrice competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through promotional discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors, some of whom are significantly larger with greater resources. In addition, there is continuing consolidation in the snack food industry and in retail outlets for snack foods, either of which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers, lose existing product authorizations at customer locations, lose market share and/or shelf space, increase expenditures or reduce selling prices, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nPrice increases for our products that we initiate may negatively impact our financial results if not properly implemented or accepted by our customers. Future price increases, such as those made in order to offset increased input costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce our revenue and operating profit. We may be unable to implement price increases driven by higher input costs on a timely basis or at all, either of which may reduce our operating profit. Additionally, if market prices for certain inputs decline significantly below the prices we are required by contract to pay, customer pressure to reduce the prices for our products could lower our revenue and operating profit.\nChanges in our top retail customer relationships could impact our revenue and profitability.\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from several large retail customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 55% of our net revenue during 2017, excluding sales of our products made by third-party distributors who are outside of the DSD network, with our largest retail customer, Wal-Mart, representing approximately 13% of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 net revenue. The loss of one or more of our large retail customers could adversely affect our financial results. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, service, product quality, product offerings, consumer demand, as well as distribution capabilities and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant retail customers may change their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with customers\u2019 demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to maintain our profitability in the face of a consolidating retail environment.\nAs the retail grocery industry continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on products that hold either the number one or number two market position and private label products. If we fail to use our sales and marketing expertise to maintain our category leadership positions to respond to these trends, or if we lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products and are unable to increase the volume of our products sold, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.\nWe are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenue and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, or changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns. Any of these changes may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur continued success also is dependent on product innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products, and the effectiveness of advertising and promotional campaigns, marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal, there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products, or to effectively execute advertising and promotional campaigns and marketing programs.\nTax matters, including changes in tax laws and rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (\u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act implements many new US domestic and international tax provisions. Many aspects of the Tax Act are unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued in the future (by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the US Treasury Department or via a technical correction law change), it may not be clarified for some time. In addition, many US states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that Tax Act, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.\nIn addition, foreign jurisdictions may also enact tax legislation that could significantly affect our ongoing operations. For example, foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting. Aspects of the Tax Act may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us.\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the ability to realize our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the US or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision.\nWe are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision and our results of operations.\nThe decision by British voters to exit the European Union may further negatively impact our operations.\nThe June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) caused uncertainty in global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the US dollar and other currencies. As the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union, volatility in exchange rates and in U.K. interest rates may continue. In the near term, a weaker British pound compared to the US dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer US dollars; a weaker British pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations; and a higher U.K. interest rate may have a dampening effect on the U.K. economy. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. However, as a result of weakening demand, whether a function of Brexit or consumer preference, we recognized impairment charges of $46.3 million and $11.8 million against our European goodwill and KETTLE\u00ae Chips U.K. trademark, respectively during 2017. Further erosion of such operations, whether by consumer demand or the impact of Brexit could result in additional impairments related to our U.K. operations.\nOur results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully.\nOur ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures, we may incur significant costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain financing. Potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; potential assumption of unknown liabilities; the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the US may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory agencies.\nFuture acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our financial results. In the event we enter into strategic transactions or relationships, our financial results may differ from expectations. We may not be able to achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of potential acquisitions or divestitures.\nPotential risks for any future divestitures, if any, include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from our Company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. We are reliant on Diamond of California to supply walnuts under a Supply Agreement. Failure of Diamond of California to provide quality products under this arrangement could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.\nThe loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial results and growth prospects.\nThere are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment, it could negatively impact manufacturing, sales, marketing or development activities. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for key employees or offer employment to potential replacements on acceptable terms.\nFailure to effectively execute and accomplish our strategy could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe utilize several operating strategies to increase revenue and improve operating performance. If we are unsuccessful due to unplanned events, our ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients could cause consumers to avoid our products.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured or become sick.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the affected product for a period of time. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We may also lose customer confidence for our entire Branded portfolio as a result of any such recall or proceeding.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to manufacture and sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, pandemics or other events. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product or ingredient is sourced from a single supplier or\nlocation. In addition, in light of recent transportation industry legislation, the number of freight carriers could decrease and create carrier shortages and higher freight costs.\nWe may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems, they could obtain and exploit confidential business, customer, or employee information and harm our competitive position. In addition, these information systems may experience damage, failures, interruptions, errors, inefficiencies, attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated by our security measures and disaster recovery plans.\nFurthermore, with multiple information technology systems as a result of acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating data. In addition, we are currently in the process of consolidating systems which could provide additional security or business disruption risks which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nImproper use or misuse of social media may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nConsumers are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication, including social media. We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However, misuse of social networking by individuals, customers, competitors, or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could negatively affect our business. Further, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to market and advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment it could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe DSD network relies on a significant number of IBOs, and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market products, maintain existing markets and expand business into other geographic markets.\nThe DSD network relies on over 2,800 IBOs for the sale and distribution of Branded and Partner brand products. IBOs must make a commitment of capital and/or obtain financing to purchase a route business and other equipment to conduct their business. Certain financing arrangements, through third-party lending institutions, are made available to IBOs and require us to repurchase a route business if the IBO defaults on their loan and we then are required to collect any shortfall from the IBO, to the extent possible. The inability of IBOs, in the aggregate, to make timely payments could require write-offs of accounts receivable or increased provisions made against accounts receivable, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe ability to maintain a DSD network depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for the brands and products which are available in a particular distribution area; (ii) the ability to price products at levels competitive with those offered by competing producers; and (iii) the ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by IBOs and retail customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on our relationships with IBOs, thus limiting maintenance and expansion of the sales market, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying new IBOs can be time-consuming and any resulting delay may be disruptive and costly to the business. There also is no assurance that we will be able to maintain current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with IBOs in new geographic distribution areas. There is the possibility that we will have to incur significant expenses to attract and maintain IBOs in one or more geographic distribution areas. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in increased expense or a significant decrease in sales volume through the DSD network and harm our business and financial results.\nA disruption in the operation of the DSD network could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe believe that the DSD network is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the IBOs could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to operate and conduct our business. In addition, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies regarding the DSD network, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the IBOs, or an adverse judgment against us for actions taken by the IBOs could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to operate and conduct our business.\nContinued success depends on the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nWe maintain numerous trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow for the protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as in the US and other countries.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities, and the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, route intangibles and other acquired intangibles. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the US (\"GAAP\"), we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or at any time when events occur, which could impact the value of our reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangibles. These values depend on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, market conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. In addition, if we see the need to consolidate certain brands, we could experience impairment of our trademark intangible assets. During 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $46.3 million and $58.4 million for goodwill and trademarks, respectively. Significant and unanticipated changes in our business could require additional non-cash charges for impairment in a future period which may significantly affect our financial results in the period of such charge.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals, and their interests may conflict with those of other shareholders.\nAs of December 18, 2017, Patricia A. Warehime beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 14.5% of our outstanding common stock based upon a Schedule 13D/A filed on January 22, 2018 by Mrs. Warehime. Mrs. Warehime serves as one of our directors. As a result, Mrs. Warehime may be able to exercise significant influence over us and certain matters requiring approval of our shareholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This could limit the ability of our other shareholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of our Company. In addition, Mrs. Warehime may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of our other shareholders.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Warehime Holders entered into a voting agreement with Campbell, pursuant to which the Warehime Holders agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of Company common stock over which they have voting power in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. As of February 16, 2018, the record date for the special meeting of our shareholders, the Warehime Holders owned 12,851,757 shares, or approximately 13.1% of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nNew regulations or legislation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFood production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state and other governmental agencies. New or increased government regulation of the food industry, including but not limited to areas related to food safety, chemical composition, production processes, traceability, product quality, packaging, labeling, school lunch guidelines, promotions, marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children), product recalls, records, storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or societal factors, such as obesity, nutritional and environmental concerns and diet trends.\nWe are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.\nIncreasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former IBOs, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party\u2019s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving the independent contractor classification of the IBOs, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of the IBOs and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy,\ndata collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect from our employees, as well as information we collect when we provide products to customers, IBOs and retailers.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategies.\nWe plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels. Consumer demand, behavior, taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations.\nOur foreign operations pose additional risks to our business.\nWe operate our business and market our products internationally. Our foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable US laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our Transformation Plan.\nIn April 2017, we announced the Transformation Plan, our plan to significantly improve our financial performance by focusing on the following six areas: (i) reduce direct spending and accelerate zero-based budgeting to improve indirect costs, (ii) reduce manufacturing and distribution network complexity and improve productivity, (iii) reduce business complexity through SKU rationalization and ongoing portfolio maintenance, (iv) improve trade spend productivity and effectiveness and optimize brand assortment, (v) reset working/non-working ratios and increase investment in our core branded portfolio and (vi) elevate the performance of the existing IBOs and DSD network. As a part of the plan, on June 26, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the closure of our manufacturing facility in Perry, Florida and an incremental reduction in workforce across the organization. In 2017, we have eliminated approximately 300 jobs. The full scope of the Transformation Plan and specific actions to be taken are currently being developed by senior management and our Board of Directors.\nThe successful design and implementation of the Transformation Plan present significant challenges, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the Transformation Plan may not advance our business strategy as expected. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays, and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated financial performance of the Transformation Plan, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the Transformation Plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, the complexity of the Transformation Plan requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transformation Plan. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from existing core businesses, integrating financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely affected.\nRisks related to our substantial indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business, and make payments on our debt.\nAs of December 30, 2017 we had an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of outstanding debt. Our substantial debt could have important consequences to holders of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future\n\u2022\nA substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates\n\u2022\nIt may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions\n\u2022\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and they, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns\n\u2022\nOur ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase\n\u2022\nOur flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins or our business\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facilities contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\nDispose of assets\n\u2022\nIncur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness)\n\u2022\nPay dividends and make certain payments\n\u2022\nCreate liens on assets\n\u2022\nMake investments (including joint ventures)\n\u2022\nEngage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets\n\u2022\nEngage in certain transactions with affiliates\n\u2022\nChange the business conducted by us\n\u2022\nAmend specific debt agreements\nOur ability to comply with these provisions in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to comply with these provisions in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy.\nThe restrictions under the terms of our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit facilities may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our credit facilities that would permit the applicable lenders or note holders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our credit facilities. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our debt facilities and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance. This, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to the financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control, as described under \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business\u201d above.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe cannot be assured that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our anticipated high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our debt, as well as prevailing market conditions. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions. As a result, we cannot assure you we will be able to consummate those sales, or if we do, what the timing of the sales will be, or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet the debt service obligations when due.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility since the interest rates associated with portions of our debt are variable. While we mitigate a portion of this volatility by entering into interest rate swap agreements, those agreements could lock our interest rates above the market rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our creditworthiness, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 48531, "SIC": 2052, "TIC": "LNCE"}
