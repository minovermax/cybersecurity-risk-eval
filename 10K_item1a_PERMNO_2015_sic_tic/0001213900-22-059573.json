{"cik": "1631282", "company": "DATASEA INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is very speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any shares of our common stock.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information included herein as well as the information included in other reports and filings made with the SEC before investing in our common stock. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, should they materialize, and you may lose part or all of your investment. The order of the following risk factors is presented arbitrarily. You should not conclude the significance of a risk factor because of the order of presentation. Our business and operations could be seriously harmed as a result of any of these risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history as a developer of smart security solutions and education technologies. Our limited operating history may not provide an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history. The operating entity, Shuhai Beijing, was formed in February 2015 and has yet to generate material revenues and it may not generate material revenue or any profit for the foreseeable future. We are still in the process of developing, marketing and expansion of our business. We expect that our safe campus, scenic area and public community security systems supported by our smart security solutions will be our core business in the future. We have limited experience and operating history in developing and marketing our products and services. In addition, the market for our products and services is highly competitive. If we fail to successfully develop and offer our products and services in an increasingly competitive market, we may not be able to capture the potential growth opportunities associated with our products and services or recover our development and marketing costs, and our future results of operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected. Our limited history may not provide a meaningful basis for investors to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s auditors\u2019 report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are an early and development stage company and have limited financial resources. We had cash balances of $49,676 and $164,217 as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We generated revenues of $17,080,911 during the year ended June 30, 2022. We had a net cash inflow of $114,541 during fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. We had a deficit of approximately $18,583,566 as of June 30, 2022.\nOur resources and source of funds have primarily consisted of loans and capital contributions from shareholders and funds raised from equity financing. We believe these are sufficient to keep our business operations functioning for the next twelve months. We have generated revenue of approximately $17 million from our business during the year ended June 30, 2022. Our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s auditors\u2019 report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, although it is noted that such liquidity concern was mitigated by the Company\u2019s sale of shares of its 2,436,904 shares of common stock at $3.48 per share on July 20, 2021, raising approximately $7,636,796, after deducting offering costs. No assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain funds from our shareholders or others to continue our operations in the future. We may need to seek additional financing. The financing sought may be in the form of equity or debt financing or a combination of both from various sources as of yet unidentified. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or obtain the necessary financing to continue as a going concern and the failure to do so could cause us to cease our operations.\nSupply chain issues that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.\nCurrently, we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities, but rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our products, and expect that we will continue to rely on existing and new contractual manufacturers for the foreseeable future. The following reliance issues could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results:\n\u25cf Any financial problems of our contract manufacturers or component suppliers could limit supply or increase costs;\n\u25cf Reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could limit supply or increase costs; and\n\u25cf Industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets could limit supply or increase costs.\nIn addition, the following supply chain-related issues could adversely affect our customer relationships, operating results and financial condition:\n\u25cf a reduction or interruption in supply of one or more components;\n\u25cf a significant increase in the price of one or more components\uff1b\n\u25cf a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; and\n\u25cf a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs.\nOver the long term, we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources to key growth areas, such as smart security products and services. We are likely to recognize the costs and expenses associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nThe smart security system we provide is highly complex as the products incorporate both hardware and software technologies. Neither we nor our contract manufacturers have developed a sophisticated product testing program due to the limit of available technologies. There can be no assurance that the pre-shipment testing programs we develop in the future will be adequate to detect all defects, including defects in individual products or defects affecting numerous shipments. Such potential defects might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins. As an example, software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. From time to time, we will have to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in our products. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material adverse impact on our business. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, additional inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, margins and net income.\nWe will likely have to incur indebtedness or issue new equity securities to fund future growth. If we are not able to obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires significant levels of capital to finance the research and development of new products and service platforms that meet the constantly evolving industry standards and consumer demands. As such, we expect that we will need additional capital to fund our future growth. For the time being, we are primarily depending on contribution from shareholders, equity financing and cash income. If cash from such sources is insufficient or unavailable, or if cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf investors\u2019 perceptions of, and demand for, companies operating in China;\n\u25cf conditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds;\n\u25cf our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\n\u25cf governmental regulation of foreign investment in China;\n\u25cf economic, political and other conditions in the United States, China and other countries; and\n\u25cf governmental policies relating to foreign currency borrowings.\nThe sale of additional equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders. In addition, the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. It is highly uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not able to obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent on retaining key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends largely on the continued services of our key management and technical staff. In particular, our success depends on the continued efforts of Ms. Zhixin Liu, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, President and Corporate Secretary, and Mr. Fu Liu, one of our directors and Ms. Liu\u2019s father. Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu have been instrumental in developing our business model and are crucial to our business development. There can be no assurance that they will continue in their present capacities for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of Ms. Liu and/or Mr. Liu could materially and adversely affect our business development.\nThe various industries we are in are characterized by constant and rapid technological change and evolving standards. If we fail to anticipate and adapt to these changes and evolutions, our sales, gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected.\nTechnologies change rapidly in the security solution, new media advertising, micro marketing and data processing industries with frequent new products and service developments and evolving industry standards. Companies operating within these industries are continuously developing new products and services with heightened performance and functionality, putting pricing pressure on existing products. Accordingly, we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate technological changes and to offer additional product and service opportunities that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our failure to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies or adapt to fluctuations in the industry could lead to our having significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices and profit margins than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to develop planned new technologies, we may be unable to compete effectively due to our failure to offer products or services most demanded by the marketplace. Products and services that our competitors develop or introduce may also render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete. If any of these failures occur, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers, and our production and products could be harmed if they are unable to meet our volume and quality requirements and alternative sources are not available.\nWe rely on third party contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. If these services become unavailable, we would be required to identify and enter into new agreements with other contract manufacturer or take the manufacturing in-house. The loss of our contract manufacturers could significantly disrupt production as well as increase the cost of production. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges to existing regulations may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the provision of our products and services, which may significantly increase our costs and adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe smart security industry in China is highly regulated by the PRC Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The PRC Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology might change the regulatory framework or impose higher technical standards in the future. As a result of this significant regulation, we may be unable to comply with existing or new laws, rules and regulations, and may have to incur extra costs in connection with engaging new technical staff, improving our existing products, and renewing our licenses.\nWe have seen a substantial improvement and progress in our internal control over financial reporting. If no improvement measures are taken, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting with an assessment report as of June 30, 2022, and plans to shorten the cycle and increase the frequency concerning the testing cycle for the effectiveness of internal control measures. The annual risk control assessment reporting system will be improved to a quarterly risk control assessment system\nOur efforts in the building of internal control system is not limited to the formulation and implementation of financial management and control measures, but focuses on the combination of comprehensive and targeted control to build up an internal control system that best fits us. According to the management system imperfections concerning job responsibilities, departmental processes and so on that are identified through self-examination, the Company, by highlighting six elements of \u201cinternal environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and internal supervision\u201d and seven control measures of separate control of incompatible functions, authorization and approval control, accounting system control, property protection control, budget control, operation analysis control and performance appraisal control\u201d, is gradually establishing and improving an internal control system featuring organizational structure, development strategy, human resources, social responsibility, corporate culture, financial activities, procurement business sales business, research and development, financial reports, comprehensive budget, contract management, internal information transfer and information system and other contents, and it is formulating the internal control system applicable to the whole company and organizing related implementation in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and supporting measures..\nBy the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we have established a Risk Control Department led by the internal control director a to ensure the Company\u2019s compliance with relevant regulations and risk management requirements; we also formulated new policies or integrate a series of internal control policies, including but not limited to the process from procurement to payment, the process from payment to the sales, cash management, cost management, budget process, accounts receivable policy, policy to prevent and detect fraud assets and inventory management, internal audit policy and cost accounting, etc., we set up bookkeeping under USGAAP and we provided training for our employees, such as the Finance Department, Marketing Department, and senior executives; we set the International Affair Department to strengthen our compliance and financing management on the international capital market; and we also employed a new legal counsel in China to enhance the Company\u2019s operational compliance on the Chinese market.\nOur compliance with complicated U.S. regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses. Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management\u2019s relative inexperience with operating U.S. public companies.\nAs a public company, we are facing with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards of a U.S. public company are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, our executive officers have little experience in operating a U.S. public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations uncertain. Our failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price.\nFailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of other companies or government agencies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nWe have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China. Companies with operations in China have been accused and found guilty of sales practices that involve unlawful activity, including violations of the FCPA. We believe to date we have complied in all material respects with the provisions of the FCPA. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants and/or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nWe may be subject to liability if private information that we receive is not secure or if we violate privacy laws and regulations.\nBecause we store, process and use data, some of which contain personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to constant evolvement and change and uncertain interpretation. Any violation of these laws could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in user growth, retention or engagement, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn November 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress passed China\u2019s first cybersecurity law, or CSL, which took effect in June 2017. The CSL systematically lays out cybersecurity and data protection regulatory requirements and subjects many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace and data management to government scrutiny. Compliance costs and other burdens related to CSL as well as China\u2019s regulatory measures on the collection, storage, use and provision of network data may affect users\u2019 use and acceptance of our products and services, and may have a significant adverse impact on our business, directly affecting our market development channels and financial revenue capacity.\nThe European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Economic Area. The GDPR establishes new requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords new data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes penalties for serious data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. Although we do not conduct any business in the European Economic Area, in the event that residents of the European Economic Area access our website and input protected information, we may become subject to provisions of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will impose additional responsibilities and liabilities in relation to our processing of personal data. The GDPR may require us to change our policies and procedures and, if we are not compliant, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to laws restricting disclosure of information relating to our employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, data security, cybersecurity and data protection. However, given that the scope, interpretation, and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service-providers to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nOur corporate structure, in particular, the Variable Interest Entities (or VIE), and their Agreements (or VIE Agreements), are subject to significant risks, as set forth in the following risk factors.\nIf the PRC government deems that the VIE Agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries or other laws or regulations of the PRC, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations, which may therefore materially reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through the operating entities established in the People\u2019s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily the variable interest entity (the \u201cVIE\u201d). Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in any internet-related businesses we may explore and operate, we do not have any equity ownership of the VIE, instead we control and receive the economic benefits of the VIE\u2019s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of the Nevada holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless. For a description of our corporate structure and contractual arrangements, see \u201cCorporate Structure\u201d on page 31 and \u201cVIE Agreements\u201d on page.\nWe believe that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements comply with the current applicable PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that each of the contracts among the wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, the consolidated VIE and its shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations.\nIf these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future and our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are deemed by the relevant regulators that have competent authority, to be illegal, either in whole or in part, we may lose control of the consolidated VIE, which conducts our manufacturing operations, holds significant assets and accounts for significant revenue, and have to modify such structure to comply with regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption to our business. Further, if our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u25cf revoking our business and operating licenses;\n\u25cf levying fines on us;\n\u25cf confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;\n\u25cf shutting down our services;\n\u25cf discontinuing or restricting our operations in China;\n\u25cf imposing conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us to change our corporate structure and contractual arrangements;\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from overseas offering to finance the consolidated VIE\u2019s business and operations; and\n\u25cf taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business.\nFurthermore, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our corporate structure and contractual arrangements. Occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common stock. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties or requirement to restructure our corporate structure causes us to lose the rights to direct the activities of the consolidated VIE or our right to receive their economic benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of such VIE in our consolidated financial statements, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or even become worthless.\nWe depend upon the VIE Agreements in conducting our business in the PRC, which may not be as effective as equity ownership.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with the consolidated VIE and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, Chairman of the Board, CEO and President of DataSea and Corporate Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of DataSea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu), to operate our business. The affiliation with Shuhai Beijing is managed through the VIE Agreements, which agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shuhai Beijing as equity ownership. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as equity ownership in providing us with control over the consolidated VIE. If the consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held by the consolidated VIE is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in the consolidated VIE, including such equity interest, may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or ownership by the record holder of the equity interest.\nAll of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, it would be very difficult to exert effective control over the consolidated VIE, and our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to consolidate the financial results of some of the affiliated companies or such consolidation could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAll of our business is conducted through Shuhai Beijing, which is considered a VIE for accounting purposes, and we are considered the primary beneficiary, thus enabling us to consolidate our financial results in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the future a company we hold as a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE under applicable accounting rules, or we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary, we would not be able to consolidate line by line that entity\u2019s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes. Also, if in the future an affiliate company becomes a VIE and we become the primary beneficiary, we would be required to consolidate that entity\u2019s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes. If such entity\u2019s financial results were negative, this would have a corresponding negative impact on our operating results for reporting purposes.\nBecause we rely on the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement with Shuhai Beijing for our revenue, the termination of this agreement Or be forcibly discharged would severely and detrimentally affect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nWe are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through the VIE Agreements. As a result, our revenues mainly rely on dividend payments from Tianjin Information after it receives payments from Shuhai Beijing pursuant to the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement. Shuhai Beijing may terminate the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement for any or no reason by Chinese government at all. Because neither we, nor the subsidiaries, own equity interests of Shuhai Beijing, the termination of the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement would sever our ability to continue receiving payments from Shuhai Beijing under our current holding company structure. While we are currently not aware of any event or reason that may cause the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement to terminate, we cannot assure you that such an event or reason will not occur in the future. In the event that the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement is terminated, this would have a severe and detrimental effect on our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which, in turn, may affect the value of your investment.\nContractual arrangements entered into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Such scrutiny may lead to additional tax liability and fines, which would hinder our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nUnder PRC law, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If any of the transactions entered into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate are found not to have been conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis or to result in an unreasonable reduction in tax under PRC law, the PRC tax authorities have the authority to disallow tax savings, adjust the profits and losses of the respective PRC entities and assess late payment interest and penalties.\nWe conduct our business through Shuhai Beijing by means of VIE Agreements. If the PRC courts or administrative authorities determine that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in such PRC laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the laws, rules and regulations governing the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements between Tianjin Information and Shuhai Beijing. We have been advised by our PRC counsel, Jingtian & Gongcheng, based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations, that (i) the structure for operating our business in China (including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Shuhai Beijing and its shareholders) will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (ii) the contractual arrangements among Tianjin Information and Shuhai Beijing and its shareholders governed by PRC law are valid, binding and enforceable, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations concerning foreign investment in the PRC, and their application to and effect on the legality, binding effect and enforceability of the contractual arrangements. In particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that PRC regulatory authorities, courts or arbitral tribunals may in the future adopt a different or contrary interpretation or take a view that is inconsistent with the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.\nIf any of the PRC entities or their ownership structure or the contractual arrangements are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or any of the PRC entities fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u25cf revoking the business and operating licenses;\n\u25cf discontinuing or restricting the operations;\n\u25cf imposing conditions or requirements with which the PRC entities may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us and the PRC entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from our 2018 offering to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u25cf imposing fines. Confiscation of income\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough the content about VIE structure has been deleted from the PRC Foreign Investment Law implemented since January 1, 2020, the disputes over VIE structure still exists and are left to be settled through legislative authorization. After that, the nature and attributes of VIE structure may still be brought into the supervision category of \u201cforeign investment\u201d in future through other specific laws, administrative regulations and normative documents formulated by the State Council. Moreover, relevant supervision will be strengthened while the pre-establishment national treatment & negative list system would not be excluded for foreign investment, which is expected to cast significant impact upon our operation and management.\nThe shareholders of the VIE may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nMs. Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu are majority shareholders of DataSea and the shareholders of the VIE, Shuhai Beijing. Ms. Liu is our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, while Mr. Liu is one of our directors. They may have potential conflicts of interest with us. These shareholders may breach, or cause the VIE to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and the VIE, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to effectively control the VIE and receive substantially all the economic benefits from it. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with Shuhai Beijing to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nCurrently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and our company. We rely on Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu to abide by the laws of the State of Nevada and China, which provide that directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company that requires them to act in good faith and in what they believe to be the best interests of the Company and not to use their position for personal gains. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the shareholders of Shuhai Beijing, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nIf any of the affiliated entities becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, we may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by such entity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations in China through contractual arrangements with the affiliated entities. As part of these arrangements, substantially all of our assets that are important to the operation of our business are held by the affiliated entities. If any of these entities goes bankrupt and all or part of their assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the affiliated entities undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its equity owner or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights relating to some or all of these assets, which would hinder our ability to operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our business, our ability to generate revenue and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and, as a result, may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to shareholders of other companies.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules because Mr. Liu and Ms. Liu hold more than 50% of our voting power. For so long as we remain a controlled company under that definition, we are permitted to elect to rely, and will rely, on certain exemptions from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u25cf the requirement that our director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors; and\n\u25cf the requirement that we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nAs a result, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market.\nRisks Associated With Doing Business in China\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of our business.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions within the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Implementation of the negative list system. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social environment.\nSubstantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing reform policies which have adversely affected China-based operating companies whose securities are listed in the United States, with significant policies changes being made from time to time without notice. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements with borrowers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. Only after 1979 did the Chinese government begin to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws that regulate economic affairs in general, deal with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, as well as encourage foreign investment in China. Although the influence of the law has been increasing, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Also, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. In addition, there have been constant changes and amendments of laws and regulations over the past 30 years in order to keep up with the rapidly changing society and economy in China. Because government agencies and courts provide interpretations of laws and regulations and decide contractual disputes and issues, their inexperience in adjudicating new business and new polices or regulations in certain less developed areas causes uncertainty and may affect our business. Consequently, we cannot predict the future direction of Chinese legislative activities with respect to either businesses with foreign investment or the effectiveness on enforcement of laws and regulations in China. The uncertainties, including new laws and regulations and changes of existing laws, as well as judicial interpretation by inexperienced officials in the agencies and courts in certain areas, may cause possible problems to foreign investors. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC.\nDraft rules for China-based companies seeking for securities offerings in foreign stock markets was released by the CSRC for public consultation. While such rules have not yet come into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over overseas public offerings conducted by China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Common Shares to investors and could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless.\nThe Chinese government may intervene or influence the operation of the VIE and its subsidiaries and exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of their business and may intervene in or influence their operations at any time with little advance notice, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our Common Shares. Further, any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer Securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nRecently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to impose filing requirements on China-based companies for their initial public offerings or listings in overseas stock markets and extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement.\nOn July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly released the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements, etc. The Opinions and any related implementing rules to be enacted may subject us to compliance requirement in the future.\nOn December 24, 2021, China Securities Regulatory Commission or the CSRC, as defined above, issued the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas Issuance and Listing of Securities by Domestic Enterprises (the \u201cDraft Administrative Provisions\u201d) and the Measures for the Overseas Issuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the \u201cDraft Filing Measures\u201d), collectively, the \u201cDraft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings\u201d, which were published for public comments until January 23,2022. According to the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings, among other things, after making initial applications with overseas stock markets for initial public offerings or listings, all China-based companies shall file with the CSRC within three working days. The required filing materials with the CSRC include (without limitation): (i) record-filing reports and related undertakings, (ii) compliance certificates, filing or approval documents from the primary regulators of applicants\u2019 businesses (if applicable), (iii) security assessment opinions issued by related departments (if applicable), (iv) PRC legal opinions, and (v) prospectus. In addition, overseas offerings and listings may be prohibited for such China-based companies when any of the following applies: (1) if the intended securities offerings and listings are specifically prohibited by the laws, regulations or provision of the PRC; (2) if the intended securities offerings and listings may constitute a threat to, or endanger national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with laws; (3) if there are material ownership disputes over applicants\u2019 equity interests, major assets, core technologies, or the others; (4) if, in the past three years, applicants\u2019 domestic enterprises, controlling shareholders or de facto controllers have committed corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property, or other criminal offenses disruptive to the order of the socialist market economy, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion of major violations; (5) if, in the past three years, any directors, supervisors, or senior executives of applicants have been subject to administrative punishments for severe violations, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion of major violations; (6) other circumstances as prescribed by the State Council. The Draft Administrative Provisions further stipulate that a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million may be imposed if an applicant fails to fulfill the filing requirements with the CSRC or conducts an overseas offering or listing in violation of the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings, and in cases of severe violations, a parallel order to suspend relevant businesses or halt operations for rectification may be issued, and relevant business permits or operational license revoked. The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings, if enacted, may subject Datasea, its subsidiaries, the VIE or the VIE\u2019s subsidiaries to additional compliance requirements in the future.\nAs of the date of this report, the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings have not been promulgated, and we have not been required to obtain permission from the government of China as of U.S. offerings. While the final version of the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listings are expected to be adopted in 2022, we believe that anything relating to clearly prohibiting overseas offering and listings would apply to us. In reaching this conclusion, we are relying on an opinion of our PRC counsel. In the event that we become subject to the compliance requirements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to receive clearance of such filing requirements in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure of us or the Subsidiaries to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Common Shares, cause significant disruption to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our Common Shares to significantly decline in value or become worthless.\nThe development of COVID-19 and a slowdown or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and our products.\nAll of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, there is no assurance that this growth will continue. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly reduce the demand for our products and services.\nIf relations between the United States and China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries that may affect our economic outlook both in the United States and in China. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common stock.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit the profitability of our business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our services and products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our services and products.\nThe fluctuation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, various factors, such as changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions and China\u2019s foreign exchange controls. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People\u2019s Bank of China has decided to further implement the reform of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such changes in policy have resulted in a significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Any significant appreciation or revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on the value of, and any dividends payable on, shares of our common stock in foreign currency terms. More specifically, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our 2018 offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the exchange rate of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock in U.S. dollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. As a result, restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any business activities we may have outside China in the future or to make dividend payments to our shareholders in U.S. dollars. Under current PRC laws and regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend distributions. However, Renminbi is not freely convertible for direct investment or loans or investments in securities outside China, unless such use is approved by SAFE. For example, foreign exchange transactions under the subsidiary\u2019s capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign exchange controls and the approval requirement of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency for capital expenditures. And the Chinese government is further strengthening the control of foreign exchange, we will not be able to change the Chinese government\u2019s decision in our own power.\nThe subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China are subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us.\nWe are a holding company and rely principally on dividends paid by the subsidiary in China for our cash needs, including paying dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders to the extent we choose to do so, servicing any debt we may incur and paying our operating expenses. Tianjin Information\u2019s income in turn depends on the service fees paid by the affiliated entities in China. Current PRC regulations permit the subsidiary in China to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Under the applicable requirements of PRC law, Tianjin Information may only distribute dividends after it has made allowances to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, if the subsidiaries or affiliated entities in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any such restrictions may materially affect such entities\u2019 ability to make dividends or make payments, in service fees or otherwise, to us, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law system may be cited as reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, newly introduced PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections of interest relating to foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of such laws and regulations may not always be consistent, and enforcement of these laws In different administrative areas and regulations involves significant uncertainties, any of which could limit the available legal protections. In addition, the PRC administrative and judicial authorities have significant discretion in interpreting, implementing or enforcing statutory rules and contractual terms, and it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative and judicial proceedings and the level of legal protection we may enjoy in the PRC than under some more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may affect our decisions on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with PRC laws and regulations, and may affect our ability to enforce our contractual or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited legal actions or threats in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from us. Such uncertainties may therefore increase our operating expenses and costs, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe PRC\u2019s legal and judicial system Under special circumstances may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors.\nThe legal and judicial systems in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is uncertain. As a result, it may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, Different administrative regions have different legal and judicial interpretations or to obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on the civil law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes. A decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes.\nThe promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. There can be no assurance that a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic or social life, will not affect the PRC government\u2019s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and all of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors in the U.S. or to enforce a U.S. court judgment against us or them in the PRC.\nOur directors and officers reside outside the United States. In addition, the operating subsidiaries are located in the PRC and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the U.S. or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in U.S. courts, it may be difficult to enforce such judgments in PRC courts.\nCertain PRC regulations, including the M&A Rules and national security regulations, may require a complicated review and approval process which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe M&A Rules established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, the MOFCOM must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition, certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated with the same entities or individuals of the domestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in August 2011, require that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors in \u201cany industry with national security concerns\u201d be subject to national security review by the MOFCOM. In addition, any activities attempting to circumvent such review process, including structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement, are strictly prohibited. There is significant uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of these regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities in China. In addition, complying with these requirements could be time-consuming, and the required notification, review or approval process may materially delay or affect our ability to complete merger and acquisition transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek growth through acquisitions may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained its approval for our entry into contractual arrangements with the affiliated entities, we may be required to file for remedial approvals. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such approval from the MOFCOM. We may also be subject to administrative fines or penalties by the MOFCOM that may require us to limit our business operations in the PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance of our funds in foreign currencies into the PRC or take other actions that could have material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to the PRC subsidiary and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nDatasea is a Delaware company conducting substantially all of its operations in China through its PRC subsidiaries, the VIE and its subsidiaries established in China. Datasea may make loans to the PRC subsidiaries and VIE entities subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or may make additional capital contributions to subsidiaries and VIE entities in China.\nAny loans to the subsidiaries or VIE entities in China are subject to foreign investment and are under PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For example, loans by us to the wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries or VIE entities in China to finance their activities must be registered with the local counterpart of SAFE. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i) directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; (ii) directly or indirectly use for investment in securities or investments other than banks\u2019 principal-secured products unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and does not violate with the negative list on foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry this out in practice. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to use our revenues effectively and the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to obtain financing.\nThe PRC government imposes control on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies. Conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, and of foreign currencies into Renminbi, for payments relating to capital account transactions, which principally includes investments and loans, generally requires the approval of SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities. Restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi for capital account transactions could affect the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to make investments overseas or to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. We cannot assure you that the registration process will not delay or prevent our conversion of Renminbi for use outside of China.\nWe must remit the offering proceeds to China in a future issuing before they may be used to benefit our business in China, the process of which may be time-consuming, and we cannot assure that we can complete all necessary governmental registration processes in a timely manner.\nThe proceeds of a future offering may be remitted back to the PRC, and the process for wiring such proceeds back to the PRC may be time-consuming after the closing of a future offering. We may be unable to use these proceeds to grow our business until the PRC subsidiaries receive such proceeds in the PRC. Any transfer of funds by us to the PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to approval by or registration or filing with relevant governmental authorities in China. Any foreign loans procured by the PRC subsidiaries is required to be registered with China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) or its local branches or satisfy relevant requirements, and the PRC subsidiaries may not procure loans which exceed the difference between their respective total project investment amount and registered capital or 2 times (which may be varied year by year due to the change of PRC\u2019s national macro-control policy) of the net worth of the PRC subsidiary. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises in China, capital contributions to the PRC subsidiaries are subject to the approval of or filing with State Administration for Market Regulation in its local branches, the Ministry of Commerce in its local branches and registration with a local bank authorized by SAFE.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to the PRC subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions by us to the PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to capitalize or otherwise fund the PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to fund and expand our business and our securities.\nA failure by the beneficial owners of our shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our ability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC law.\nSAFE has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (or SAFE Circular No. 37), effective on July 4, 2014, and its appendices, that require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.\nThese regulations apply to our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers that we make in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures on the application and implementation of SAFE regulations, and since SAFE Circular No. 37 was relatively new, there remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. As of the date of this report, all PRC residents known to us that currently hold direct or indirect interests in our company have completed the necessary registrations with SAFE as required by SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with the requirements of SAFE Circular 37. However, we cannot assure you that these individuals or any other direct or indirect shareholders or beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents will be able to successfully complete the registration or update the registration of their direct and indirect equity interest as required in the future. If they fail to make or update the registration, our shareholders could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and SAFE could restrict our cross-border investment activities and our foreign exchange activities, including restricting the PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain loans denominated in foreign currencies from, our company, or prevent us from paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to fine due to our insufficient payment of the social insurance and housing fund of the employees.\nPursuant to the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, as amended on December 29, 2018,and the Regulation on the Administration of Housing Accumulation Funds, as amended on March 24, 2019, employers in China shall register with relevant social insurance agency and relevant housing provident fund management center and open special housing provident fund accounts for each of their employees, and pay contributions to the social insurance plan and the housing provident fund for their employees, such contribution amount payable shall be calculated based on the employee\u2019s actual salary in accordance with the relevant regulations. In case the employer failed to make sufficient payment of the social insurance, it may be subject to fine up to 3 times of the insufficient amount and pay late fees. If the employer failed to register with relevant housing provident fund management center or failed to open special housing provident fund accounts for the employees within the ordered time limit, a fine of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000 may be imposed. In addition, if the employer fails to pay sufficient contributions to housing provident fund as required, the housing provident fund management center shall order it to make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit; where the payment has not been made after the expiration of the time limit, the housing provident fund management center may request the people\u2019s court for compulsory enforcement. On July 20, 2018, the General Office of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Reform Plan on Tax Collection and Administration Systems for Local Offices of the State Administration of Taxation and Local Taxation Bureaus, according to which the collection and administration of social insurance will be transferred from the social insurance departments to competent tax authorities, and the supervision over the payment of social insurance will be significantly strengthened in the way that an enterprise must pay social insurance for its employees based on their overall salary at certain legally required rates. If we are fined due to insufficient payment of the social insurance and housing fund of the employees, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder of ours since we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and all of our officers and directors reside in China.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in China through Shuhai Beijing, the consolidated VIE in China. All of our current officers and directors reside outside the United States and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. Because of this factor, it may be difficult for you to conduct due diligence on our company, our executive officers or directors and attend stockholder meetings if the meetings are held in China. As a result, our public stockholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major stockholders than would stockholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly within the United States.\nYou may experience difficulties in protecting your rights through the United States courts.\nCurrently, substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of our officers are nationals or residents of the PRC and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a stockholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nIn addition, it may be difficult or impossible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon us our directors and officers in the event that you believe that your rights have been violated under United States securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in effecting service of process and bringing an action of this kind, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the PRC of judgments obtained in the United States.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nThe economy of China has been experiencing significant growth, leading to inflation and increased labor costs. China\u2019s overall economy and the average wage in the PRC are expected to continue to grow. Future increases in China\u2019s inflation and material increases in the cost of labor may materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nOur auditor is headquartered in the United States, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. To the extent that our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company become located in China, the PCAOB may not be able inspect such audit documentation and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our common stock could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in this report filed with the SEC and will issue audit reports related to our company in the future. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor\u2019s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. On December 2, 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. We are required by the HFCAA to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely certain named registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our independent registered public accounting firm is headquartered in the United States and in particular, the State of New York and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis and as such, it is not affected by or subject to the PCAOB\u2019s Determination Report. To the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB, our common stock could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nOur securities may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. As a result, an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would decrease the number of non-inspection years for foreign companies to comply with PCAOB audits from three to two, thus reducing the time period before their securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.\nIn light of recent events indicating greater oversight by the CAC over data security, we may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cybersecurity and data protection, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business and our securities.\nSince 2021, the Chinese government has strengthened its anti-monopoly supervision, mainly in three aspects: (1) establishing the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau; (2) revising and promulgating anti-monopoly laws and regulations, including: the Anti-Monopoly Law (draft Amendment published on October 23, 2021 for public opinions), the anti-monopoly guidelines for various industries, and the detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Fair Competition Review System; and (3) expanding the anti-monopoly law enforcement targeting Internet companies and large enterprises. As of the date of this report, the Chinese government\u2019s recent statements and regulatory actions related to anti-monopoly concerns have not impacted our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange because neither the Company nor its PRC operating entities engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions.\nOn November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (\u201cCAC\u201d) released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), or the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has not been promulgated as of the date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding more than one million users/users\u2019 individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data processing activities refers to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. According to the latest amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022, an online platform operator holding more than one million users/users\u2019 individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad.\nAs of the date of this report, Datasea, its subsidiaries, the VIE and VIE\u2019s subsidiaries have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries to go through cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that Datasea, its subsidiaries, the VIE and VIE\u2019s subsidiaries do not possess personal data of at least one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security in their business operations as of the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users\u2019 personal information or data that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nCompliance with China\u2019s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review (revised draft for public consultation), Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.\nChina has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China\u2019s new Data Security Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China in June 2021, or the Data Security Law, will take effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on \u201cdata classification and hierarchical protection system\u201d for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. As the Data Security Law has not yet come into effect, we may need to make adjustments to our data processing practices to comply with this law.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s Cyber Security Law, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity\u2019s information and network systems belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to the Measures for the Graded Protection and the Guidelines for Grading of Classified Protection of Cyber Security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval.\nRecently, the Cyberspace Administration of China has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at \u201cpreventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public interests.\u201d On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.\nIt is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on the life sciences sector generally and the Company in particular. China\u2019s regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.\nIn addition, our securities may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for three consecutive years beginning in 2021. As a result, an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would decrease the number of non-inspection years for foreign companies to comply with PCAOB audits from three to two, thus reducing the time period before their securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted.\nAlso, on August 20, 2021, the National People\u2019s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which will be implemented on November 1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year.\nInterpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market or the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.\nOn November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), or the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has not been promulgated as of the date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding more than one million users/users\u2019 individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data processing activities refers to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. According to the latest amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022, an online platform operator holding more than one million users/users\u2019 individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad.\nAs of the date of this report, Datasea, its subsidiaries and VIE entities have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries to go through cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that the PRC subsidiaries do not possess personal data of at least one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security in their business operations as of the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users\u2019 personal information or data that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely to us, materially disrupt our business.\nInternet and technology companies are frequently involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, unfair competition, invasion of privacy, defamation and other violations of third-party rights. The validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries, particularly in China, are uncertain and still evolving. In addition, many parties are actively developing and seeking protection for Internet-related technologies, including seeking patent protection. There may be patents issued or pending that are held by others that cover significant aspects of our technologies, products, business methods or services. As we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes more common in China in resolving commercial disputes, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.\nIn particular, if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, may be ordered to pay damages or fines, and may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives. We may incur substantial expense in defending against third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual property in question. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur majority stockholders will control our Company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval.\nOur officers and directors collectively hold approximately 63.28% beneficial ownership of our Company. Two directors are members of the same family. As a result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our Company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other shareholders and be disadvantageous to our shareholders with interests different from those individuals. These individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers and directors of our Company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our Company.\nAn active and visible trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nWe cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market:\n\u25cf Investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u25cf Market visibility for our common stock may be limited; and\n\u25cf A lack of visibility for our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, changes in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, announcements of innovations by us or our competitors, general conditions in the industry in which we operate and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as:\n\u25cf the perception of U.S. investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf negative publicity, studies or reports;\n\u25cf conditions in Chinese and global cybersecurity product markets;\n\u25cf our capability to match and compete with technology innovations in the industry;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies in the same industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in or impacting China.\nDevelopment of COVID-19\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nOur common stock is \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock may be considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act, as amended. Our common stock may be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock, which could depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock, have an adverse effect on the market for shares of our common stock, and thereby depress price of our common stock.\nPotential future sales under Rule 144 may depress the market price for our common stock.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a person who has satisfied a minimum holding period of between six months to one-year, as well as meeting any other applicable requirements of Rule 144, may thereafter sell such shares publicly. Therefore, the possible sale of unregistered shares may, in the future, have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in the over-the-counter market.\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we determine to pay dividends in the future, our ability to do so will depend upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from Shuhai Beijing. Shuhai Beijing may, from time to time, be subject to restrictions on its ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.", "PERMNO": 18306, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "DTSS"}
