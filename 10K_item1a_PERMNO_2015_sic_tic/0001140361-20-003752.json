{"cik": "310142", "company": "SENSIENT TECHNOLOGIES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs with any business, the Company\u2019s business and operations involve risks and uncertainties. In addition to the other discussions in this report, particularly those under the headings \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d below and \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above, the following factors should be considered:\n\u25cf Intense competition with our competitors may result in reduced sales and profitability.\nWe develop, manufacture, and sell flavors, flavor enhancers, ingredients, extracts, and bionutrients; essential oils; natural ingredients, including dehydrated vegetables and other food ingredients; natural and synthetic food and beverage colors; cosmetic colors and ingredients; pharmaceutical and nutraceutical excipients and ingredients; and technical colors, specialty colors, and specialty dyes and pigments. We sell these products to customers in industries and markets that are highly competitive. We face intense competition from multiple competitors in each of our business lines. These competitors range from large multinational flavor and fragrances companies with broad and sophisticated product portfolios and outstanding technological capabilities to smaller more specialized regional companies that focus on a single product line or offering. Our success against these competitors depends upon our ability to continually develop and manufacture safe, high quality, innovative, and legally compliant products across each of our product lines in varying batch sizes, at varying frequencies, and at acceptable prices. We also must provide outstanding product development support, on time delivery, regulatory assistance, and after-sale product support to all of our customers, wherever they are located. If we are unable to do these tasks, or if competitors do any of these tasks better than us, we may lose part or all of our business with some customers. We do lose to competitors from time to time. Competition can reduce both our sales and the prices at which we are able to sell our products, which can negatively affect our results.\n\u25cf Intense competition among our customers and their competitors may result in reduced sales and profitability for our customers and us.\nGenerally, we do not sell products directly to consumers. The customers to whom we sell our products incorporate our products into their own products. Our customers face intense competition. This competitive pressure has caused some of the Company\u2019s customers to change or reduce ordering patterns, to resist price increases, to discontinue or reduce existing product offerings, and to introduce fewer new products and reduce or eliminate traditional limited time offerings. Additionally, the commercial outlets for many of our customers are also under intense competitive pressure, which has caused many such commercial outlets to be resistant to price increases from their suppliers. Ultimately, our ability to sell our products to customers depends upon our customers\u2019 ability to succeed against their competitors and to respond effectively to the demands of their own customers. When our customers do not successfully compete, as happens from time to time, it can impact our sales and the prices at which we sell our products, which can negatively affect our results.\n\u25cf In some product lines, most of our sales are made to a relatively small number of customers; if we lose any of those customers, sales and operating results could decline.\nIn some of our product lines, our sales are concentrated with a small number of customers. While we do not currently have any single customer that we consider to be significant to us as a whole, the loss of a significant customer for a particular product line could substantially affect the sales and profitability of that line or the business unit that sells that product line, which may cause us to re-evaluate that line. Those developments could affect our results.\n\u25cf Consolidation has resulted in customers with increased buying power, which can affect our profitability.\nMany of our customers have consolidated in recent years and we expect the combination trend to continue in many business lines. These consolidations have often produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases. If the larger size or greater buying power of those customers results in additional negotiating strength, the prices we are able to charge could be negatively affected and our profitability could decline.\n\u25cf Our sales and profitability are affected by changing consumer preferences, changing regulations and technologies, and our ability and our customers\u2019 ability to make and sell to consumers in highly competitive markets.\nAlthough we do not generally make or sell proprietary consumer products, many of our products are sold to companies that develop and market consumer products, either directly or through other commercial and retail outlets. Sales of flavors, colors, cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical excipients and ingredients, and many of our other products depend in part upon our customers\u2019 ability to create and sell products to consumers in highly competitive markets, all of which are beyond our control. Our sales could also be affected by changing regulations or technologies that could impact consumer demand for products that contain our products. Therefore, we depend upon our customers\u2019 ability to create markets for the consumer products that incorporate the products that we manufacture. In addition, if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to the needs of our customers as they evolve in response to changing consumer preferences, new technologies, and price demands, our results could be adversely affected. Additionally, the market pressures on our customers may adversely affect the willingness of these customers to launch new products, to introduce limited time offerings, and to grow or continue to produce existing product lines. In the past year, we have seen a reduction in new product launches, smaller new product launches, and fewer limited time offerings from some of our customers. Any of these actions by our customers can adversely affect our results.\nIndex\n\u25cf The financial condition of our customers may adversely affect their ability to buy products from us at current levels, to accept price increases, or to pay for products that they have already purchased.\nAs mentioned above, our customers are under intense pressure in their markets from competitors and as a result of changing consumer preferences. These combined pressures have resulted in some of the Company\u2019s customers entering bankruptcy or receivership during the past 12 months. There is risk that other customers of the Company could enter bankruptcy or receivership in the next 12 months. Once in bankruptcy or receivership, these customers are restricted from paying certain outstanding invoices to the Company until later in the bankruptcy process and even when able to pay, may not be able to pay the full amounts owed. Additionally, financially distressed customers may change or reduce ordering patterns, reduce willingness to accept price increases, discontinue or reduce existing product offerings, and introduce fewer new products. Those developments could adversely affect our results.\n\u25cf Many of our products are used in items for human consumption and contact. We may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability and corporate image.\nWe sell flavors, fragrances, and colors that are used in foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and other items for human consumption or contact. These products involve risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, product defects, and other adulteration. If the consumption or use of our products causes product damage, injury, illness, or death, we may be subject to liability, including class action lawsuits and other civil and governmental litigation. We are also subject to product liability claims involving products containing diacetyl and related chemicals. From time to time, we or our customers have withdrawn or recalled products in the event of contamination, product defects, or perceived quality problems. If our customers withdraw or recall products related to ingredients that we provide to them, as has occurred in the past, they may make claims against us.\nAlthough we vigorously defend against claims when they are made, there can be no assurance that any claims or recalls will not be material. While we maintain liability insurance against these risks, coverage may be unavailable or incomplete. A significant product defect, product recall, or product liability judgment can negatively impact our profitability for a period of time depending on the insurance coverage, costs, adverse publicity, product availability, scope, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the cost of defense and the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness, injury, or death or any recall involving our products could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate image and thereby adversely impact our profitability.\n\u25cf If we do not maintain an efficient cost structure, our profitability could decrease.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain an efficient cost structure. We regularly initiate cost-reduction measures that could impact our manufacturing, sales, operations, and information systems functions. If we do not continue to manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, or we do not successfully implement related strategies, our competitiveness and our profits could decrease. As discussed above, the price pressures in our markets, make such cost reduction efforts particularly important.\n\u25cf A disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe generally rely on third party suppliers for various raw materials that we use to make our products. We use many different chemical, natural products, and other commodities as raw material ingredients. We also use raw materials whose production is energy intensive and dependent on successful farming techniques and favorable climatic and environmental conditions. As the demand for natural products continues to grow, these risks associated with agriculture are becoming increasingly important. In addition, we obtain some raw materials from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Disruptions or other issues with those suppliers could affect the availability of those materials. Even if there are multiple suppliers of a particular raw material, there are occasionally shortages. Constrictions in supply of raw materials can lead to increased costs. We may not be able to pass these costs to customers for a variety of reasons, including the fact that some of our competitors may not be subject to the increased costs. Additionally, as noted below, government regulatory action against any of our suppliers could also cause a supply disruption. For example, as noted below, within the last 18 months, Chinese regulators shut down suppliers that provided the Company with raw materials for synthetic colors and inks. This adversely impacted the supply of raw materials for these products and, therefore, impacted our ability to produce products containing these raw materials, which adversely impacted our ability to provide these products at traditional quantities and competitive prices. Therefore, any future unavailability or shortage of a raw material, however caused, could negatively affect our operations using that raw material and thus adversely affect our results.\nIndex\n\u25cf A disruption in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe develop, manufacture, and distribute our products around the world. Generally, our labs and plants are dedicated to particular product lines. For example, many (but by no means all) of our food colors products are developed and manufactured in our St. Louis facility. While we have redundant capabilities across labs and plants for many product lines, in some cases we only manufacture particular products at one facility. To establish a new manufacturing capability at a plant would require substantial time, money, and numerous governmental and customer approvals. Additionally, because of the complexity and highly specialized nature of many of the products we produce, it would require a tremendous amount of technical, engineering, and management time and effort to establish the new capability. Manufacturing involves inherent risks such as industrial accidents, environmental events, labor disputes, product quality control issues, safety issues, licensing and regulatory compliance requirements, as well as natural disasters, conflicts, terrorist acts, cyber-attacks, and other events that we cannot control. If one of our development or manufacturing facilities is disrupted or impaired, we could cause a supply disruption to our customers, which could cause short and long-term damage to our customer relationships. Such disruption would have an adverse effect on our financial performance and future growth.\n\u25cf Our ability to efficiently manage inventory may not be as effective as we anticipate and may adversely impact our performance.\nEfficient inventory management is essential to our performance. We must maintain appropriate inventory levels and product mix to meet customer demand, without incurring costs related to storing and holding excess inventory. If our inventory management decisions do not accurately predict demand or otherwise result in excess inventory, as has happened in the past, our financial results may be adversely impacted by markdowns, impairment charges, or other costs related to disposal of excess or obsolete inventory.\n\u25cf Commodity, energy, and transportation price volatility may reduce our profitability.\nWe use various energy sources in our production and distribution processes. Commodity and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation, production and transportation disruption, disruptive world events, and changes in governmental regulations. Commodity and energy price increases will raise both our raw material costs and operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. Increasing our prices also may reduce sales volume and related profitability.\n\u25cf There are an enormous number of laws and regulations applicable to us, our suppliers, and our customers across all of our business lines. Compliance with these legal requirements is costly to us and can affect our operations as well as those of our suppliers and customers. Failure to comply could also be costly and disruptive.\nOur facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations relating to the environment, health, safety, and the content, processing, packaging, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food, drugs, cosmetics, other consumer products, specialty inks, and industrial colors. These laws and regulations are administered in the United States by the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, and other federal and state governmental agencies. We, our suppliers, and our customers are subject to similar governmental regulation and oversight abroad. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be complex and costly and affect our, our suppliers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 operations. Also, if we, our suppliers, or our customers, fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil and criminal remedies, fines, recalls of products, and private civil lawsuits. Regulatory action against a supplier or customer can create risk for us and negatively affect our operations. Actions by regulatory agencies against us and our suppliers can also adversely impact the availability of raw materials. For example, within last 18 months Chinese regulators shutdown suppliers that provided the Company with raw materials for synthetic colors and inks. This adversely impacted the supply of raw materials for these products and, therefore, impacted our ability to produce these products and our ability to provide these products at traditional quantities and competitive prices. Anytime raw materials become more costly or unavailable due to legal, regulatory, or other governmental actions our profitability could be adversely impacted.\n\u25cf Environmental compliance may be costly to us.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and stringent laws and regulations that pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling of materials, and disposition of wastes and air emissions. These rules operate or will operate at both the federal and state levels in the United States, and there are analogous laws at most of our overseas locations. Environmental regulations, and the potential failure to comply with them, can have serious consequences, including the costs of compliance and defense; interference with our operations or the ability to obtain required permits; civil, criminal, and administrative penalties; and negative publicity. Additionally, the ability of our suppliers to comply with environmental regulations may cause adverse effects on us by reducing or eliminating the availability of necessary raw materials or increasing the cost of raw materials. These factors might adversely impact our ability to make certain products as well as our profitability on the products that can be made.\nIndex\n\u25cf We depend on certain key personnel, and the loss of these persons may harm our business, including the loss of trade secrets.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service and availability of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract and retain qualified new personnel. The competition for these individuals can be significant, and the loss of key employees could harm our business. In addition, we need to provide for smooth transitions when replacing key management and technical personnel positions. Our operations and results may be negatively affected if we are not able to do so. Additionally, many of our key personnel must have access to the Company\u2019s trade secrets to effectively perform their job responsibilities. Although we seek to impose confidentiality, non-solicitation, loyalty, and non-competition obligations on many employees through agreements and our Code of Conduct, these efforts may not be successful. Furthermore, litigation to enforce departing employees\u2019 legal obligations may not be successful as the legal systems in many jurisdictions disfavor restrictions on an employee\u2019s right to change jobs as well as on preemptive measures to prevent the disclosure of a company\u2019s trade secrets and intellectual property before it occurs. As a result, there is a possibility that certain competitors could attempt to exploit the Company\u2019s trade secrets and confidential information to the Company\u2019s competitive detriment, which could adversely impact our profitability.\n\u25cf We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries where we operate. While the Company maintains robust policies to prevent violations of these laws and to monitor third party risks, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws is expensive and could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Under these laws companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by their directors, officers, employees, agents, or other representatives. We could be subject to substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties if we or any of our representatives fail to comply with these laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\n\u25cf Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights is key to our performance.\nWe protect our intellectual property rights as trade secrets, through patents, under confidentiality agreements, and through internal and external physical and cyber security systems. We could incur significant costs in asserting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves from third party intellectual property claims. The laws of some of the countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u25cf Our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade our information technology systems, and to respond effectively to failures, disruptions, compromises, or breaches of our information technology systems, may adversely affect our competitiveness and profitability.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain a current information technology platform for our businesses to operate effectively, reliably, and securely. We routinely review and upgrade our information technology and cybersecurity systems in order to better manage, report, and protect the information related to our formulas, research and development, manufacturing processes, trade secrets, sales, products, customers, personnel, and other operations. If we do not continue to maintain our information technology and cybersecurity platforms and successfully implement upgrades to systems to protect our vital information as well as our facilities and IT systems, our competitiveness and profits could decrease. Because of the nature of our business, and the importance of our proprietary information and manufacturing facilities, we face threats not only from hackers\u2019 intent on theft (including theft through the use of ransomware) and disruption, but also from malicious insiders that may attempt to steal Company information. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be susceptible to failures, disruptions, breaches, theft, employee carelessness in the face of social engineering threats, and other similar cybersecurity events. The impact of any such event and the effectiveness of our response thereto may adversely affect our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, regulatory consequences, and reputational harm. While we take substantial steps to protect our information and systems through cyber security systems, monitoring, auditing, and training, these efforts may not always be successful. And, while we maintain liability insurance against these risks, coverage may be unavailable or incomplete.\n\u25cf Changes in tax rates or tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may negatively affect our results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates; changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions; the costs of repatriations; or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could negatively impact our results.\nIndex\nWe are also subject to the routine examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of these countries. The results of such assessments or audits, if adverse to the Company, could negatively impact our results.\nWe have transfer pricing policies that are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. Many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. However, governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and, if challenged, we may not prevail. We could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies.\n\u25cf The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuation may negatively affect our results.\nWe report the results of our foreign operations in the applicable local currency and then translate those results into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. The applicable exchange rates between and among foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future. These fluctuations have impacted our results of operations in recent periods as discussed below in more detail under the headings \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\u201d Such currency exchange rate volatility may also adversely impact our financial condition or liquidity. While we may use forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk, such risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Operating in foreign countries and emerging markets exposes us to increased risks, including economic, political, and international operation risks.\nWe operate, manufacture, and sell our products and obtain raw materials in many foreign countries and emerging markets. This subjects us to risks that could materially impact our operating results, including: difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel in diverse cultures; transportation delays or interruptions; sometimes unpredictable regulatory changes; and the effects of international political developments and political and economic instability. In addition, changes in policies by the United States or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs, trade regulations, taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers. For example, changes in the trade relationship between the U.S. and China as well as potential regulatory actions by the Chinese government may affect the availability and cost of our raw materials and products originating in China, the demand for as well as the supply of our products manufactured in China or containing raw materials from China, and the demand from Chinese customers for our products.\n\u25cf Brexit may adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue and profits in the short term and long term.\nIn 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K. left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Over the next eleven months the British government and the European Union will be negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. During the pendency of those negotiations, the U.K. will remain a part of the EU trading block. That status is currently set to expire on December 31, 2020. Although that status can be extended until December 31, 2022, the U.K. is currently stating that it will not seek such an extension. If no agreement is reached with the European Union by December 31, 2020, the U.K. will be out of the European trading block and will be subject to tariffs under the World Trade Organization regime. So far, the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union has also resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. In 2019, we also had customers change order patterns in response to the uncertainty created by Brexit, and our UK businesses experienced lower demand for flavor, color, and cosmetic products.\nBecause the Company has production facilities, customers, and suppliers in the U.K., the final terms of the agreement on the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union, or the absence of such an agreement, could have a significant impact on the Company.\nThe Company has revenue related to sales of products between the U.K. and the European Union or its trade agreement partners, and costs related to raw materials purchases between the U.K. and the European Union or its trade agreement partners.\nAny agreement, or the absence of an agreement, related to Brexit, could result in an increase in tariffs on all raw materials and finished goods moving between the U.K. and the European Union. Similarly, any agreement, or the absence of an agreement, could result in the U.K. losing the benefit of existing trade agreements between the European Union and other non-European Union countries, thereby increasing tariffs on all raw materials and finished goods moving between the U.K. and those non-European Union countries. An increase in tariffs could increase the cost to produce and sell the Company\u2019s products, reduce the supply of and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and profit. In both the short and long term, increased costs could make the Company less competitive with companies not impacted by post-Brexit tariffs and, given the nature of our industry, could result in the short term and long term loss of customers that choose to introduce new products or reformulate existing products with our lower-cost competitors.\nIndex\nA new border between the U.K. and the European Union could also impose increased cost, complexity, and delays (perhaps lengthy) related to the shipping and transportation of raw materials and finished products into and out of the U.K. These delays will complicate the Company\u2019s production and distribution planning and, like increased tariffs, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profit, supply and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and customer retention and acquisition in both the long term and short term.\nAdditionally, post-Brexit, new chemical regulations could be imposed within the U.K. to replace existing European Union regulations such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Similarly, because the U.K. will no longer be part of the European Union, the Company may be subject to new REACH registration requirements for products produced in the U.K. The costs related to compliance with these regulatory changes could affect the Company\u2019s costs, revenue, profit, supply of and demand for the Company\u2019s products, and the acquisition and retention of customers.\nNext, there could be new restrictions on travel and immigration that result from Brexit that could impose additional costs on the Company. In each of the Company\u2019s three U.K. production facilities, a significant portion of the work forces are not U.K. nationals. Complying with new immigration regimes could result in increased costs to the Company.\nFinally, while the Company will take steps to mitigate the effects of Brexit, these efforts may not be as successful as intended, and the Company may not be able to avoid the costs and complications described above. Brexit has thus had and may continue to have adverse impacts on our results.\n\u25cf The impact of tariffs and other trade barriers may negatively affect our results.\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities located around the world. The Company sells to customers located both inside and outside the countries in which products are manufactured. The Company also depends upon suppliers both inside and outside the countries in which products are manufactured. Tariffs and other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or other countries have affected and could continue to adversely affect our manufacturing costs, our ability to source and import raw materials, our ability to export our products to other markets, and our ability to compete successfully against other companies that are not impacted by tariffs to the same extent as the Company. Additionally, the uncertainties created by tariffs and other trade barriers have also affected and could continue to affect our customers\u2019 demand for our products because, for example, the customers decide to delay product launches or destock inventory due to these uncertainties. It is difficult to predict the effects of current or future tariffs and other trade barriers and disputes, and the Company\u2019s efforts to reduce the effects of tariffs through pricing and other measures may not be effective.\n\u25cf Changes to LIBOR may negatively impact us.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We have used LIBOR as a reference rate in our revolving loans, term loans, asset securitization program, and uncommitted credit facilities such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to these loans is calculated using LIBOR.\nLIBOR, in its current form, is currently scheduled to disappear in 2021. Before LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with a new standard, which has yet to be established. The consequences of these developments still cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which references LIBOR, as a result of applicable margin or reference rate increases. As of December 31, 2019, 25% of our total debt referenced LIBOR. While our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.\nThe Company hedges certain foreign currencies using forward contracts which are typically less than fifteen months in length. Certain forward contracts utilize LIBOR as a basis for forward point calculations and may be subject to adjustments when LIBOR ceases to exist. We do not anticipate material impacts as a result of the LIBOR transition on our contracts due to the tenor; however, cannot provide assurance that a transitional rate will be established for the settlement of outstanding contracts when LIBOR ceases to exist.\n\u25cf World events and natural disasters are beyond our control and could affect our results.\nWorld events can adversely affect national, international, and local economies. Economies can also be affected by conflicts, natural disasters, changes in climate, epidemics, or other catastrophic events. Such events and conditions, as well as uncertainty in or impairment of financial markets, have adversely affected and could continue to affect our revenues and profitability, particularly if they occur in locations in which we or our customers have significant operations. In addition, while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world, certain of our facilities are the sole manufacturer of a specific product and a disruption in manufacturing could lead to increased costs of relocating or replacing the production of a product, or reformulating a product, which could have an adverse effect on our results. In late January, Chinese authorities began to implement closures and other restrictions on work and travel in various regions of the country in response to the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. As of this filing, it is impossible to predict the full impact of this epidemic within China and beyond, but resulting disruption of our manufacturing, distribution, sales, and travel activities could have an adverse effect on our results.\nIndex\n\u25cf We may not successfully complete and integrate past and future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have acquired many companies and operations in the past and may continue growth by acquisition in the future. Our future growth through acquisitions could involve significant risks that may have a material adverse effect on us. We may also be at risk for factors associated with acquisitions that the Company has made in the past. Acquired companies may also have significant latent liabilities that may not be discovered before an acquisition or fully reflected in the price we pay.\nWe may also need to finance future acquisitions, and the terms of any financing, and the need to ultimately repay or refinance any indebtedness, may have negative effects on us. Acquisitions also could have a dilutive effect on our financial results. Acquisitions also generally result in goodwill, which would need to be written off against earnings in the future if it becomes impaired.\n\u25cf We may not successfully complete divestitures of certain product lines, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs discussed above, the Company has announced its intent to divest certain product lines. If those product lines are not sold in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely impacted and management could be distracted. We could also incur expenses with these divestitures and additional charges that are greater than we currently anticipate.\n\u25cf Our recent restructurings may not be as effective as we anticipated and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings.\nFrom 2014-2017, the Company executed a restructuring plan aimed at eliminating underperforming operations, consolidating manufacturing facilities, and improving efficiencies within the Company. These activities required the devotion of significant resources and management attention and may pose significant risks. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to effectively reduce overhead, rationalize manufacturing capacity, and effectively produce products at the consolidated facilities. Furthermore, our restructurings may not be as effective as we anticipated, and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expected from these restructurings.", "PERMNO": 59619, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "SXT"}
