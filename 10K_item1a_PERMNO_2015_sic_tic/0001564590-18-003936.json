{"cik": "1060009", "company": "KINDRED HEALTHCARE, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Common Stock. To facilitate your consideration of all of the risks described below, these risks are organized under headings and subheadings for your convenience. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and stock price.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions and other risks which may cause the Merger to be delayed or not completed at all or have other adverse consequences.\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Failure to satisfy or obtain waivers of any closing condition may jeopardize or delay the completion of the Merger and result in additional expenditures of money and resources including, but not limited to, the adverse impact of a termination fee of $29 million and reimbursement of documented out-of-pocket expenses of up to $10 million. The Merger is also subject to approval by the Company\u2019s\nstockholders. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s stockholders will approve the Merger. In addition, the Merger is contingent upon the receipt of certain state healthcare and insurance regulatory clearances or approvals. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or prevent the closing of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, the price of our Common Stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated.\nLegal proceedings instituted against the Company and others relating to the Merger Agreement also could delay or prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the agreed upon timeframe. In addition, we may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger before or after stockholder approval. Further, uncertainty among our employees about their future roles after the completion of the Merger may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and the pendency of the Merger may disrupt our business relationships with our existing and potential referral sources, customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, and other business partners, who may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. The adverse consequence of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction and related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of costs associated with completing the Merger and the planned separation of the Company\u2019s businesses pursuant to the Separation Agreement. Such costs include the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the related separation transactions, including legal and other professional advisory fees. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses and will primarily consist of transaction costs related to the Merger and the separation and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs also may be incurred.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, amend our organizational documents, incur indebtedness and settle litigation. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, which may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Reimbursement and Regulation of Our Business\nHealthcare reform has initiated significant changes to the United States healthcare system.\nVarious healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the ACA. The reforms contained in the ACA have impacted each of our businesses in some manner. Several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services, the methods of payment for our services, and the underlying regulatory environment. The reforms include the possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling payments to cover both acute and post-acute care, and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers.\nThe ACA also provides for: (1) reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for LTAC hospitals, IRFs, home health agencies, and hospice providers, which could result in lower reimbursement than in preceding years; (2) additional annual \u201cproductivity adjustment\u201d reductions to the annual market basket payment update as determined by CMS for LTAC hospitals and IRFs, home health agencies, and hospice providers; (3) a quality reporting system for hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs); and (4) reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals (including LTAC hospitals and IRFs) for failure to meet certain quality reporting standards or to comply with standards in new value-based purchasing demonstration project programs.\nFurther, the ACA mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the ACA mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement that began with federal fiscal year 2014 and was phased-in over a four-year period, and a reduction in the outlier cap. In addition, the ACA requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress.\nPotential efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal, amend, modify, or retract funding for various aspects of the ACA create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the ACA on us and the healthcare industry.\nIn addition, a primary goal of healthcare reform is to reduce costs, which includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers. Moreover, healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies, other third party payors, our customers, as well as other healthcare providers, which may in turn negatively impact our business. As such, healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the ACA (including any repeal, amendment, modification or retraction thereof), as well as other similar healthcare reforms, including any potential change in the nature of services we provide, the methods or amount of payment we receive for such services, and the underlying regulatory environment, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe implementation of patient criteria for LTAC hospitals under the LTAC Legislation reduces the population of patients eligible for reimbursement under LTAC PPS and changes the basis upon which we are paid for other patients, which has had, and will continue to have, an adverse affect on our business, revenues and profitability.\nMedicare payments to LTAC hospitals are now based upon one of two methods; (1) LTAC PPS, or (2) a site-neutral formula based upon the lesser of what a short-term acute care hospital would be paid, or estimated cost. CMS classifies LTAC hospitals as a distinct provider type, separate from short-term acute care hospitals. Only providers certified as LTAC hospitals may be paid under the LTAC PPS system. CMS regulations classify LTAC hospital patients into MS-LTC-DRGs. LTAC PPS is based upon discharged-based MS-LTC-DRGs, similar to IPPS.\nUnder the new criteria set forth in the LTAC Legislation, LTAC hospitals treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTAC PPS. Other patients will continue to have access to LTAC care, whether they are admitted to LTAC hospitals from acute care hospitals or directly from other settings or the community, and in such cases, LTAC hospitals will be paid at a site-neutral rate for these patients, based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or an estimate of cost. We expect the majority of these site-neutral payments will be materially less than the payments provided under LTAC PPS. The BBA imposes a mandatory 4.6% reduction in payments for services provided to site-neutral patients over a nine-year period beginning October 1, 2018.\nThe effective date of the new patient criteria was October 1, 2015, tied to each individual LTAC hospital\u2019s cost reporting period, followed by an initial two-year phase-in period, which was extended by an additional two years by the BBA. During the four-year phase-in period, payment for patients receiving the site-neutral rate is based 50% on LTAC PPS and 50% on the site-neutral rate. The majority of our TC hospitals (all of which are certified as LTAC hospitals under the Medicare program) have a cost reporting period starting on September 1 of each year, and thus the phase-in of new patient criteria did not begin for a majority of our TC hospitals until September 1, 2016, and, with the enactment of the BBA, full implementation of the new criteria will not occur until September 1, 2020. We expect that the full implementation of the new criteria on September 1, 2020 will have a further negative impact on Medicare payments to our TC hospitals.\nBeginning in 2020, the LTAC Legislation requires that at least 50% of a hospital\u2019s patients must be paid under the new LTAC PPS system to maintain Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital. The failure of one or more of our TC hospitals to maintain its Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe new patient criteria imposed by the LTAC Legislation reduces the population of patients eligible for reimbursement under LTAC PPS and changes the basis upon which we are paid for other patients. In addition, the LTAC Legislation is subject to additional governmental regulations and the interpretation and enforcement of those regulations. In response to the impact of the LTAC Legislation, we have sold or closed approximately 23% of our TC hospitals from 2013 through 2017. The LTAC Legislation, the implementation of new patient criteria, changes in referral patterns, and other associated elements has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of payment from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a substantial reduction in our revenues and operating margins.\nWe depend on reimbursement from third party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for a substantial portion of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately 59% of our total revenues from continuing operations (before eliminations) from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors, such as commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and contracted providers. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. See \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nCongress continues to discuss deficit reduction measures, leading to a high degree of uncertainty regarding potential reforms to governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These discussions, along with other continuing efforts to reform, amend, modify, repeal or otherwise retract governmental healthcare programs, both as part of the ACA and otherwise, could\nresult in major changes in the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems on both the national and state levels. Potential reforms include changes directly impacting the government and private reimbursement systems for each of our businesses. Reforms or other changes to the payment systems, including modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, or bundling payments to cover acute and post-acute care or services provided to dually eligible Medicare and Medicaid patients may be proposed or could be adopted by Congress or CMS in the future.\nCMS introduced the HHGM Proposal in July 2017. Under the HHGM Proposal, Medicare payments for home health services would have been based upon a new payment methodology known as the home health grouping model (previously defined as HHGM), utilizing a 30-day (rather than a 60-day) episode of care, comorbidities (rather than therapy service-use thresholds), and other criteria to set payments. In November 2017, CMS announced that it was not finalizing the HHGM Proposal and that it would instead take additional time to further engage with stakeholders to move towards a system that shifted the focus from volume of services to a more patient-centered model. If CMS decided to implement the HHGM Proposal or other payment reform for home health care providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe BBA, passed on February 9, 2018, will implement several changes to Medicare home health reimbursement, including (1) basing payment on a 30-day episode of care (beginning January 1, 2020), coupled with annual determinations by CMS to ensure budget neutrality (including taking into account provider behavior), (2) eliminating the retroactive payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required (beginning January 1, 2020), (3) extending the 3% add-on payment for home health services provided to residents in rural areas (beginning January 1, 2018), coupled with a reduction and phase out of such add-on payment over the following four years, and (4) establishing a market basket update of 1.5% for the federal fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020.\nWeak economic conditions also could adversely affect the budgets of individual states and of the federal government. This could result in attempts to reduce or eliminate payments for federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities. In addition, private third party payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review, and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These private payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and are requesting that healthcare providers assume more financial risk.\nThough we cannot predict what reform proposals will be adopted or finally implemented, healthcare reform and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity through, among other things, decreasing funds available for our services or increasing operating costs. We could be affected adversely by the continuing efforts of governmental, private third party payors, and conveners to contain healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third party payor programs, including Medicare supplemental insurance policies, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Future changes in third party payor reimbursement rates or methods, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursement for our services and products could result in a material reduction in our revenues. Our operating margins continue to be under pressure because of reduced Medicare reimbursement, deterioration in pricing flexibility, changes in payor mix, changes in length of stay, and growth in operating expenses, particularly labor, employee benefits and professional liability costs, exceeds payment increases from third party payors. In addition, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients or commercial payors remains limited. These results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and changes in regulations, the enforcement of these regulations, or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are regularly subject to inquiries and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable healthcare program participation and payment regulations. We also are subject to government investigations. We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding most segments of the healthcare industry remains intense.\nThe extensive federal, state, and local regulations affecting the healthcare industry include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to licensure, billing, provision of services, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities, allowable costs, and prices for services, facility staffing requirements, qualifications and licensure of staff, environmental and occupational health and safety, and the confidentiality and security of health-related information. In particular, various laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute, anti-fraud, and anti-abuse amendments codified under the Social Security Act prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs. Sanctions for violating those anti-kickback, anti-fraud, and anti-abuse amendments include criminal penalties, civil sanctions, fines, and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. For additional information regarding our regulatory environment, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state governments continue to pursue intensive enforcement policies resulting in a significant number of investigations, inspections, audits, citations of regulatory deficiencies, and other regulatory sanctions including demands for refund of overpayments, terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bans on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, and civil monetary penalties or criminal penalties. We expect audits under the CMS RAC program and other federal and state audits evaluating the medical necessity of services to further intensify the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry as third party firms engaged by CMS and others conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify improper payments to healthcare providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. If we fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations, and prohibitions applicable to our businesses, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties, or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to investigations, audits, or other enforcement actions related to these laws, regulations, or prohibitions. Furthermore, should we lose the licenses for one or more of our facilities as a result of regulatory action or otherwise, we could be in default under our Master Lease Agreement, the Credit Facilities (as defined below), and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Failure of our staff to satisfy applicable licensure requirements, or of our hospitals, home health and hospice operations, IRFs, and rehabilitation operations to satisfy applicable licensure and certification requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal, state, and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or the intensity of federal and state enforcement actions. Changes in the regulatory framework, including those associated with healthcare reform, and sanctions from various enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe face and are currently subject to reviews, audits, and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and other payors, and these reviews, audits, and investigations could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we face and are currently subject to various governmental reviews, audits, and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. An increasing level of governmental and private resources are being devoted to the investigation of allegations of fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and federal and state regulatory authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on healthcare providers by the Social Security Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other applicable laws. We are routinely subject to audits under various government programs, including the RAC program, in which CMS engages third party firms to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments to healthcare providers under the Medicare program.\nIn addition, we, like other healthcare providers, are subject to ongoing investigations by the OIG, the DOJ, and state attorneys general into the billing of services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients, including whether such services were properly documented and billed, whether services provided were medically necessary, and general compliance with conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Private pay sources such as third party insurance and managed care entities also often reserve the right to conduct audits. Our costs to respond to and defend any such reviews, audits, and investigations are significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment.\nThese audits and investigations may require us to refund or retroactively adjust amounts that have been paid under the relevant government program or from other payors. Further, an adverse review, audit, or investigation could result in other adverse consequences, particularly if the underlying conduct is found to be pervasive or systemic. These consequences include: (1) state or federal agencies imposing significant fines, penalties, and other sanctions on us; (2) loss of our right to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more third party payor networks; (3) indemnity claims asserted by customers and others for which we provide services; and (4) damage to our reputation in various markets, which could adversely affect our ability to attract patients and employees. If they were to occur, these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe incur significant costs to investigate and defend against a variety of claims, including professional liability, wage and hour, and minimum staffing claims. In addition to large compensatory claims, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are increasingly seeking, and have sometimes been successful in obtaining, significant fines, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Furthermore, there are continuing efforts to limit the ability of healthcare providers to utilize arbitration as a process to resolve these claims. As a result of these factors, our legal defense costs and potential liability exposure are significant, unpredictable, and likely to increase.\nWe also are subject to lawsuits under the FCA and comparable state laws for submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs. These lawsuits, which may be initiated by \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys\u2019 fees, and the award of bounties to private qui tam\nplaintiffs who successfully bring these suits and to the government programs. We also are subject to indemnity claims under contracts with our Kindred Rehabilitation Services division customers relating to the provision of our services.\nWhile we are able to insure against certain of these costs and liabilities, such as our professional liability risks described below, we are not able to do so in many other cases. In the absence of insurance proceeds, we must fund these costs and liabilities from operating cash flows, which can reduce our operating margins and funds available for investment in our business, and otherwise limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nProvisions for loss for our professional liability risks are based upon management\u2019s best available information including actuarially determined estimates. The allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount, based upon past experiences, for losses incurred but not reported. These amounts are necessarily based upon estimates and, while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts recorded. Changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks. A relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks. Differences between the ultimate claims costs and our historical provisions for loss and actuarial assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSee note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits, and investigations to which we are subject.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex federal and state government laws and regulations that govern and restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources.\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA, and similar state laws materially restrict our relationships with physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our healthcare facilities, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the safe harbors, most of our current arrangements, including with physicians and other referral sources, may not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nOur financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.\nAdditionally, if we violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d lawsuit.\nIf we fail to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA, or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities or healthcare activities), exclusion of one or more facilities or healthcare activities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs and, for violations of certain laws, regulations, and criminal penalties.\nWe do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs, and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.\nCost containment initiatives undertaken by third party payors, conveners, and referral sources may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nInitiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs or to respond to healthcare reform could affect the profitability of our services. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with providers of healthcare to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will continue and intensify and may further limit\nreimbursements for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments reduce the amounts they pay for services or limit access to our services, our profit margins may decline or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates. These results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn addition, certain third parties, known as conveners, offer patient placement and care transition services to managed care companies, Medicare Advantage plans, bundled payment participants, accountable care organizations, and other healthcare providers as part of an effort to manage PAC utilization and associated costs. Thus, conveners influence patient decision on which PAC setting to choose, as well as how long to remain in a particular PAC facility. Given their focus on perceived financial savings, conveners customarily suggest that patients avoid higher cost PAC settings altogether or move as soon as practicable to lower cost PAC settings. However, conveners are not healthcare providers and may suggest a PAC setting or duration of care that may not be appropriate from a clinical perspective. Conveners may suggest that patients select alternate care settings to our TC hospitals, IRFs or home health locations or otherwise suggest shorter lengths of stay in such settings. Efforts by conveners to avoid our care settings or suggest shorter lengths of stay in our care settings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe also depend on referrals from physicians, hospitals, IRFs, nursing centers, assisted living facilities, and other healthcare providers in the communities we serve. Many of our third party referral sources are becoming increasingly focused on controlling PAC costs, including as a result of bundled payment initiatives, population health management activities, and incentives placed on short-term acute care hospitals to reduce spending on Medicare fee-for-service patients over 90-day episodes of care. Our ability to attract and retain patients and customers could be adversely affected if any of our facilities fail to provide or maintain a reputation for providing cost-effective care as compared to other facilities or providers in the same geographic area.\nFurther consolidation of managed care organizations and other third party payors may adversely affect our profits.\nManaged care organizations and other third party payors have continued to consolidate in order to enhance their ability to influence the delivery and cost structure of healthcare services. Consequently, the healthcare needs of a large percentage of the United States population are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations. These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers for needed services. In addition, third party payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures. To the extent that these organizations terminate us as a preferred provider, engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider, demand discounted fee structures, limit the patients eligible for our services, or seek our assumption of all or a portion of the financial risk through a prepaid capitation arrangement, our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our TC hospitals fail to maintain their certification as LTAC hospitals, our revenues and profitability could decline.\nIf our TC hospitals, satellite TC facilities, or HIHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for certification as LTAC hospitals, such as minimum average length of patient stay, they will receive payments under IPPS rather than payment under the system applicable to LTAC hospitals for qualifying patients. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals for patients that otherwise qualify for payment under LTAC PPS would result in our TC hospitals receiving less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for patient services, and our profitability would decline. To maintain certification under LTAC PPS, the average length of stay of Medicare patients must be greater than 25 days, except for patients receiving a site-neutral rate or Medicare Advantage patients.\nBeginning in 2020, the LTAC Legislation requires that at least 50% of our patients must be paid under the new LTAC PPS system to maintain Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital. Under the new criteria, LTAC hospitals treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under LTAC PPS.\nThe failure of one or more of our TC hospitals to maintain its Medicare certification as a LTAC hospital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nExpiration of the moratorium imposed on certain federal regulations otherwise applicable to LTAC hospitals, including HIHs and satellite hospitals, could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and profitability.\nCMS has regulations governing payments to a LTAC hospital that is co-located with another hospital, such as a HIH. The rules generally limit Medicare payments to the HIH if the Medicare admissions to the HIH from its co-located hospital exceed 25% of the total Medicare discharges for the HIH\u2019s cost reporting period, known as the 25 Percent Rule. There are limited exceptions for admissions from rural hospitals, urban single hospitals, and MSA Dominant hospitals. Patients transferred after they have reached the short-term acute care outlier payment status are not counted toward the admission threshold. Patients admitted prior to meeting the admission threshold, as well as Medicare patients admitted from a non co-located hospital, are eligible for the full payment under LTAC PPS. If the HIH\u2019s admissions from the co-located hospital exceed the limit in a cost reporting period, Medicare will pay the\nlesser of: (1) the amount payable under LTAC PPS; or (2) the amount payable under IPPS, which likely will reduce our revenues for such admissions. At December 31, 2017, we operated 13 HIHs with 494 licensed beds.\nIn 2007, CMS expanded the 25 Percent Rule to all LTAC hospitals, regardless of whether they are a HIH. Under these regulations, all LTAC hospitals were to be paid LTAC PPS rates for admissions from a single referral source up to 25% of aggregate Medicare admissions. Patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short-term hospital were not to be counted when computing the 25% limit. Admissions beyond the 25% threshold were to be paid at lower IPPS rates.\nSince 2007, various legislative enactments have created moratoriums on the expansion of the 25 Percent Rule to freestanding LTAC hospitals. The 21st Century Cares Act further extended the moratorium on the application of the 25 Percent Rule until October 1, 2017, which was later extended to October 1, 2018 pursuant to regulations issued by CMS during 2017. Generally, until October 1, 2018: (1) LTAC hospitals may admit up to 50% of their patients from a co-located hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS; and (2) LTAC hospitals that are co-located with an urban single hospital or a MSA Dominant hospital may admit up to 75% of their patients from such urban single or MSA Dominant hospital and still be paid according to LTAC PPS. The LTAC Legislation further provides that co-located LTAC hospitals certified on or before September 30, 1995 are exempt from the provisions of the 25 Percent Rule. The Secretary of HHS has issued a report to Congress indicating that it will continue to consider whether to further modify or extend the 25 Percent Rule.\nSince these rules are complex and are based upon the volume of Medicare admissions and the source of those admissions, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on our future revenues or operations from these regulations. If the 25 Percent Rule is fully implemented, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nHealthcare reform and other regulations could adversely affect the liquidity of our customers, which could have an adverse effect on their ability to make timely payments to us for our products and services.\nThe ACA and other laws and regulations that limit or restrict Medicare and Medicaid payments to our customers could adversely impact the liquidity of our customers, resulting in their inability to pay us, or to timely pay us, for our products and services. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations they could be subject to possible sanctions, including loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs, as well as civil and criminal penalties. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we do not manage admissions in the IRFs that we operate or manage in compliance with a 60% threshold, reimbursement for services rendered by us in these facilities will be based upon less favorable rates.\nIRFs are subject to a requirement that 60% or more of the patients admitted to the facilities have one or more of 13 specific conditions in order to qualify for IRF PPS. If that compliance threshold is not maintained, the IRF will be reimbursed at IPPS applicable to acute care hospitals. That likely would lead to reduced revenue in the IRFs that we operate or manage and also may lead customers of IRFs to attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts or terminate their contracts. Our inability to appropriately manage admissions in our IRFs in compliance with applicable thresholds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we are found to have violated HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Omnibus Rule or any other privacy and security regulations, we could be subject to sanctions, fines, damages and other additional civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operation, and liquidity.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend, and seek accounting of their own health information, and limiting most uses and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The HITECH Act strengthened HIPAA enforcement provisions and authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions for HIPAA violations. It permits HHS to conduct audits of HIPAA compliance and impose penalties even if we did not know or reasonably could not have known about the violation and increases civil monetary penalty amounts up to$50,000 per violation with a maximum of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. The Omnibus Rule extended certain privacy and security regulations to business associates and their subcontractors that handle protected health information and imposed new requirements on HIPAA business associate contracts. The Omnibus Rule also clarified a covered entity\u2019s notification and reporting requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information. This reporting obligation supplements state laws that also may require notification in the event of a breach of personal information.\nIf we are found to have violated the HIPAA privacy or security regulations or other federal or state laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, including but not limited to the HITECH Act and the Omnibus Rule, we could be subject to sanctions, fines, damages and other additional civil or criminal penalties, including litigation with those affected, which could\nincrease our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nApproximately 18% of our hospice revenues are derived from patients who reside in nursing centers. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and \u201croom and board\u201d provided to hospice patients residing in nursing centers could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability.\nFor hospice patients receiving nursing center care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, the state must pay, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing center rate for \u201croom and board\u201d furnished to the patient by the nursing center. The reduction or elimination of Medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing centers would significantly reduce our home health and hospice revenues and profitability. In addition, changes in the way nursing centers are reimbursed for \u201croom and board\u201d services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing centers could affect our ability to obtain referrals from nursing centers. A reduction in referrals from nursing centers would adversely affect our home health and hospice revenues and profitability.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of approximately $3.2 billion in addition to the availability of approximately $504 million under our asset-based loan revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) (subject to a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately $156 million of letters of credit outstanding on such date, including):\n\u2022\n$1.36 billion of senior secured indebtedness under our term loan credit facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d, and together with the ABL Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d);\n\u2022\n$750 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under our 8.00% senior notes due 2020 (the \u201cNotes due 2020\u201d);\n\u2022\n$500 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under our 6.375% senior notes due 2022 (the \u201cNotes due 2022\u201d);\n\u2022\n$600 million of senior unsecured indebtedness under our 8.75% senior notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes due 2023\u201d); and\n\u2022\nsubject to our compliance with certain covenants and other conditions, we have the option to incur certain additional secured indebtedness and/or additional unsecured indebtedness.\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under the Credit Facilities are variable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from pursuing business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult or expensive to refinance our existing debt as it matures.\nOur indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase, or retire our capital stock or indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances, and acquisitions.\nThe terms of the Credit Facilities also include certain additional restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in business other than relating to owning, operating, or managing healthcare facilities;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions;\n\u2022\nmodify certain agreements;\n\u2022\nmake or incur capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nhold cash and temporary cash investments outside of collateral accounts.\nIn addition, the Credit Facilities require us to comply with financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, or other opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Facilities or the indentures governing our outstanding notes.\nWe, including our subsidiaries, have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness, including senior secured indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nSubject to the restrictions in the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, we, including our subsidiaries, have the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness. Although the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur outstanding indebtedness is collateralized by substantially all of our material assets including certain owned real property and is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned, domestic material subsidiaries. The terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes include covenants and certain other provisions that limit acquisitions, annual capital expenditures and other activities. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes at December 31, 2017. However, a downturn in operating earnings or events beyond our control could impair our ability to comply with the covenants contained within the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If we anticipated a potential financial or other covenant violation, we would seek to amend the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes or obtain relief from our lenders for the Credit Facilities and the holders of the outstanding notes, which likely would include costs to us, and such amendment or relief may not be on terms as favorable as those in the Credit Facilities or the outstanding notes, as applicable. Under those circumstances, there is also the possibility that we may not be able to amend the terms of the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes and/or our lenders under the Credit Facilities or the holders of the outstanding notes would not grant relief to us.\nIf an event of default occurs under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any declaration of acceleration or event of default under one debt instrument or under the Master Lease Agreement also could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and the Master Lease Agreement and require us to immediately repay all amounts then outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the outstanding notes. Our inability to avoid or prevent a default under the financial or other covenants under our Credit Facilities or the indentures governing the notes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Moreover, counterparties to some of our contracts material to our business may have the right to amend or terminate those contracts if we have an event of default or a declaration of acceleration under certain of our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to pay rents related to our leased properties and service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nA substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of rents related to our leased properties, as well as principal and interest obligations on our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions.\nOur ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial position at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn addition, our Master Lease Agreement and/or our outstanding indebtedness:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our rent and interest obligations, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain a certain defined coverage ratio above a specified level and a certain defined total indebtedness ratio below a specified level, thereby reducing our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nrequire us to limit the amount of capital expenditures we can incur in any fiscal year; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to discontinue operation of any leased property despite its level of profitability and otherwise restrict our operational flexibility.\nThese provisions:\n\u2022\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic conditions (including adverse regulatory changes);\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to make material acquisitions, obtain future financing, or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\ncould increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business; and\n\u2022\ncould adversely affect our ability to pay cash dividends.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could affect the amount of our interest payments and, accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facilities, we have entered into interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our interest rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility; however, any interest rate swaps we enter into do not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. As a result, an increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market interest rates, increases due to refinancing our debt in the future, or an increase in our own cost of borrowing, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability. For example, a change of one-eighth percent in the interest rates for the Credit Facilities would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $1 million.\nOur failure to pay rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of our Master Lease Agreement could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we leased 29 of our TC hospitals from Ventas under our Master Lease Agreement. Our failure to pay the rent or otherwise comply with the provisions of our Master Lease Agreement would result in an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d under the Master Lease Agreement and also could result in a default under the Credit Facilities and, if repayment of the borrowings under the\nCredit Facilities were accelerated, also under the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Upon an Event of Default, remedies available to Ventas include, without limitation, terminating the Master Lease Agreement, repossessing and reletting the leased properties and requiring us to remain liable for all obligations under the Master Lease Agreement, including the difference between the rent under the Master Lease Agreement and the rent payable as a result of reletting the leased properties, or requiring us to pay the net present value of the rent due for the balance of the term of the Master Lease Agreement. The exercise of such remedies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFor additional information on the Master Lease Agreement, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Ventas Master Lease Agreement.\u201d\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise. Certain of our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nRecently passed tax legislation may limit the deductibility of interest expense for taxes.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d). The Tax Reform Act may limit interest expense deductions for certain companies, like us, that are highly levered. A reduction in our interest expense deduction could result in us paying more federal income taxes or using our available federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) on an accelerated basis, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital and Liquidity\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, and it may trade at prices below the price at which you purchased our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly from time to time as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory and/or reimbursement changes applicable to our businesses;\n\u2022\nquarterly or other periodic variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete the Merger, including the expected timing of the Merger or failure to obtain required regulatory or shareholder approvals or satisfy other conditions to closing of the Merger;\n\u2022\nadverse outcomes from litigation and/or government, regulatory, or internal investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nnational, regional, and industry-specific economic, financial, business, and political conditions;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u2022\npress releases or negative publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in healthcare;\n\u2022\nsales of stock by insiders;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nsuccessful cybersecurity attacks or other information systems breaches;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks, and pandemics; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to repurchase our Common Stock.\nBroad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, security holders often institute class action litigation following periods of volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities. If the market value of our Common Stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become a party to this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to decline.\nFuture issuances or sales of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock, in the public market, whether by us or our existing stockholders, future issuances of additional shares of Common Stock in connection with any\nfuture acquisitions or pursuant to employee benefit plans and future issuances of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of options or warrants, or the perception that such sales, issuances, and/or exercises or conversions could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, which could decline significantly. Sales by our existing shareholders might also make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital by selling new Common Stock at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe may issue additional Common Stock in the future in connection with capital raises, acquisitions, strategic transactions, or for other purposes. To the extent we issue substantial additional Common Stock, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced, which may negatively affect the market price for our Common Stock.\nWe discontinued payment of dividends on our Common Stock in 2017 and we cannot predict if or when a dividend may be declared in the future.\nOur Board elected, following the March 31, 2017 cash dividend payment on our Common Stock, to discontinue paying dividends on our Common Stock and will instead redirect funds to repay debt and invest in growth. There can be no assurance if or when we will pay a dividend on our Common Stock. Our ability and desire to pay dividends on our Common Stock are based on many factors, including the success of our operations, the level of demand for our services, the level of payments for our services, changes in healthcare regulations, and our liquidity needs that may vary substantially from our estimates. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and a change in any such factor could affect our ability or desire to pay dividends. In addition, the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and would prevent dividends if we are in default under any of those agreements. Our election to not pay a dividend could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock may cause the Common Stock price to decline, which may negatively impact your investment.\nOur Board is authorized to issue series of shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over Common Stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve, or wind up our business, and other terms. Any other preferred stock we may issue in the future will rank senior to all of our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up. If we issue cumulative preferred stock in the future that has preference over Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of Common Stock, the market price of Common Stock could decrease, which may negatively impact your investment.\nThe condition of the financial markets, including potential volatility and weakness in the equity, capital, and credit markets, could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our businesses.\nFrom time to time, financial markets experienced significant disruptions. These disruptions may impact liquidity in the debt markets, make financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, significantly reduce the availability of certain types of debt financing. While we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under the Credit Facilities, the obligations of each of the lending institutions in the ABL Facility are separate, and the availability of future borrowings under the ABL Facility could be impacted by volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events. We cannot assure you that a prolonged downturn in the credit markets or other circumstances will not impact our ability to access or refinance the Credit Facilities. Our inability to access or refinance the Credit Facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we have future capital needs that cannot be funded from operating cash flows, any future issuances of equity securities may dilute the value of our Common Stock, and any additional issuances of debt may increase our leverage.\nWe may need additional capital if a substantial acquisition or other growth opportunity becomes available or if unexpected events occur or opportunities arise. We cannot assure you that additional capital will be available or available on terms favorable to us. If capital is not available, we may not be able to fund internal or external business expansion or respond to competitive pressures or other market conditions. If available, we may obtain additional capital through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities. However, our ability to access the public debt or equity capital markets, on terms favorable to us or at all, may be limited by disruptions in these markets or other events. If we sell equity securities, the transaction could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Furthermore, these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges more favorable than those of our Common Stock. If we incur additional debt, our leverage may increase and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nWe could experience significant increases to our operating costs due to shortages of qualified nurses, therapists, home health and hospice employees, physicians and other healthcare professionals or union activity.\nWe, like other healthcare providers, have experienced difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified healthcare personnel in a highly competitive market, including nurses, therapists, home health and hospice employees, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. Our operations are particularly dependent on nurses, therapists, and home health and hospice employees for patient care. As the demand for our services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, our operators have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Our difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel has increased our average wage rates and may force us to increase our use of higher cost contract personnel. We expect to continue to experience increases in our labor costs primarily due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel. Salaries, wages, and benefits were approximately 67% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our ability to manage labor costs will significantly affect our future operating results.\nIn addition, healthcare providers are experiencing a high level of union activity across the country. At December 31, 2017, approximately 2,400 of the employees at 12 of our facilities were unionized. Though we cannot predict the degree to which future union activity will affect us, there are continuing legislative proposals that could result in increased union activity. We could experience an increase in labor and other costs from such union activity. Furthermore, we could experience a disruption of our operations if our employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage.\nFederal, state, and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to significant additional labor costs, back pay awards, fines, and lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping, and other wage and hour matters, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the ACA, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour laws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by federal, state and local governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. Because labor represents such a large portion of our operating costs, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines, and lawsuits. We are currently subject to class actions, employee-related claims, and other lawsuits and proceedings in connection with our operations, including, but not limited to, those related to alleged violations of federal and state wage and hour laws, wrongful discharge, retaliation, and illegal discrimination. These claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. In addition, federal, state and local proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time, provide for higher minimum wages, paid time off and other similar initiatives could, if implemented, adversely affect our operations. Our failure to comply with federal, state, and local employment-related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. See note 24 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of pending legal proceedings, governmental reviews, audits, and investigations to which we are subject.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe entered into the RehabCare CIA on January 11, 2016 with the OIG. The RehabCare CIA imposes monitoring, auditing (including by an independent review organization), reporting, certification, oversight, screening, and training obligations with which we must comply.\nIn the event of a breach of the RehabCare CIA, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties and/or our RehabCare subsidiaries could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. The imposition of monetary penalties would adversely affect our profitability. The costs associated with compliance with the RehabCare CIA could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. Any breach or failure to comply with the RehabCare CIA, the imposition of substantial monetary penalties, or any suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe could experience significant legal actions, fines, and increases in our operating costs if we fail to comply with state minimum staffing requirements.\nVarious states in which we operate have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Staffing requirements in some states are not contingent upon any additional appropriation of state funds in any budget act or other statute. Our ability to satisfy such staffing requirements will, among other things, depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals.\nWhile we seek to comply with all applicable staffing requirements, the regulations in this area are complex and we may experience compliance issues from time to time. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in one or\nmore facilities failing to meet the conditions of participation under relevant federal and state healthcare programs and the imposition of fines or other sanctions. In addition, private litigation involving these matters also has become more common.\nMoreover, a portion of the staffing costs we incur is funded by states through Medicaid program appropriations or otherwise. If states do not appropriate sufficient additional funds to pay for any additional operating costs resulting from such minimum staffing requirements, our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain professional and general liability insurance, or if professional and general liability insurance becomes more costly for us to obtain, our business may be adversely affected.\nFor professional and general liability risks, we maintain a self-insured retention per occurrence and Cornerstone insures all losses in excess of this retention up to specified limits per occurrence. Cornerstone maintains commercial reinsurance through unaffiliated commercial reinsurers for these losses in excess of our retention. On a per claim basis, coverage for losses in excess of those insured by Cornerstone are maintained through unaffiliated commercial reinsurance carriers. Cornerstone insures claims in all states up to a per occurrence limit without the benefit of any aggregate stop loss limit. We maintain professional and general liability insurance in amounts and coverage that management believes are sufficient for our operations. However, our insurance may not cover all claims against us or the full extent of our liability nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost. Moreover, the cost of reinsurance coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers is costly and may continue to increase. There can be no assurances that in the future reinsurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will be able to maintain adequate levels of professional and general liability insurance coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages that are uninsured, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nCertain events or circumstances could result in the impairment of our assets or other charges, including, without limitation, impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that result in material charges to earnings.\nWe review the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, finite lived intangible assets, and indefinite-lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period may be necessary, such as when the market value of our Common Stock is below equity carrying value. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate, based upon the fair value of our reporting units, whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired. If circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts of any of these assets cannot be recovered based upon estimated future cash flows, the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value. If the carrying value of any of these assets is impaired, we may incur a material charge to earnings. There has been a significant increase in activity in this area the past few years, including the selected items set forth below. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of recent impairment charges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a hospital division reporting unit goodwill impairment charge of $236 million in connection with our goodwill annual impairment test performed as of October 1, 2017. The impairment was required after cash flow projections and related mitigation strategies were refined after completing the first full year of operations under the LTAC Legislation. The refinement of the projections and mitigation strategies were finalized over the last three months of 2017 in connection with the preparation of our annual budget for 2018. We also tested the carrying value of our hospital division intangible assets and property and equipment and determined impairment charges of $3 million for a Medicare license and $1 million for property and equipment were also necessary. The fair value of the assets was measured using Level 3 inputs, such as operating cash flows, market data, and replacement cost factoring in depreciation, economic obsolescence and inflation trends.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we also recorded an asset impairment charge of $4 million related to previously acquired home health and hospice certificates of need as part of the annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment review at October 1, 2017. The fair value of the certificates of need was measured using Level 3 inputs, such as operating cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded asset impairment charges of $135 million related to the previously acquired RehabCare trade name ($98 million) and customer relationship intangible asset ($37 million) due to the expected loss of affiliated contracts related to the SNF Divestiture and cancellation of non-affiliated contracts. The fair value of the trade name was measured using Level 3 inputs, such as projected revenues and royalty rate. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was measured using Level 3 inputs, such as discounted projected future operating cash flows.\nIn connection with (1) the October 2016 sale of 12 TC hospitals to a group of entities operating under the name \u201cCurahealth\u201d (the \u201cCurahealth Disposal\u201d), (2) the closure of three TC hospitals in the third quarter of 2016, (3) a reduction in revenues associated with revenue rate reductions announced by CMS on August 2, 2016, (4) continued increases in labor costs during 2016, and (5) a refinement of the impact of the LTAC Legislation that became effective for the majority of our TC hospitals on September 1, 2016 (collectively, the \u201cHospital Division Triggering Event\u201d), we were required to assess the recoverability of our hospital division reporting unit goodwill in the third quarter of 2016.\nAs a result of the Hospital Division Triggering Event, we determined that a goodwill impairment charge aggregating $261 million was necessary for the third quarter of 2016. We also assessed the recoverability of the hospital division intangible assets and property and equipment and concluded a property and equipment impairment charge of $3 million was necessary.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recorded impairment charges in connection with the Curahealth Disposal aggregating $33 million, of which $20 million was related to property and equipment, and $13 million was related to goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, we also recorded a property and equipment impairment charge of $8 million under the held and used accounting model related to the planned Curahealth Disposal.\nFuture adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets or a decline in the value of our Common Stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets. Moreover, the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could be negatively impacted by potential healthcare reforms. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nDelays in collection of our accounts receivable could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPrompt billing and collection are important factors in our liquidity. Billing and collection of our accounts receivable are subject to the complex regulations that govern Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and rules imposed by nongovernment payors. Our inability, or the inability of our customers, to bill and collect on a timely basis pursuant to these regulations and rules could subject us to payment delays that could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Further, the timing of payments made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is subject to governmental budgetary constraints, resulting in an increased period of time between submission of claims and subsequent payment under specific programs, most notably under the Medicaid and Medicaid Managed programs, which typically pay claims approximately 60 to 90 days slower than the average TC hospital claim. Reimbursement from the Medicaid and Medicaid Managed programs accounted for 7% and 3% of our revenues, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we may experience delays in reimbursement as a result of the failure to receive prompt approvals related to change of ownership applications for acquired or other facilities or from delays caused by our or other third parties\u2019 information system failures. Significant delays in billing and/or collections may adversely affect the borrowing base under the ABL Facility, potentially limiting the availability of funds under the ABL Facility.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our payors and customers, which in the future may cause us to make larger allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write-offs.\nDue to weak economic and industry conditions, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement reductions, shifts in healthcare utilization, and other factors, commercial payors and customers may default on their payments to us, and individual patients may default on co-payments and deductibles for which they are responsible under the terms of either commercial insurance programs or Medicare. Although we review the credit risk of our commercial payors and customers regularly, such risks may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to anticipate or control, such as a general economic downturn or changes in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. If our payors or customers default on their payments to us in the future, we may have to record higher provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts or incur bad debt write-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAny acquisition, investment, or strategic alliance that we have made or may make in the future may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful, and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nWe intend to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of, investments in, and strategic alliances with, home health and hospice operations, IRFs, hospitals, and rehabilitation operations, particularly where an acquisition may assist us in scaling our operations more rapidly and efficiently than internal growth. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, dilutive issuances of equity securities, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAcquisitions, investments, and strategic alliances involve numerous risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to identify acquisitions that meet our target criteria and complete such acquisitions on reasonable terms and valuations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to access equity or capital to fund acquisitions, including difficulty in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a reasonable cost, or that such financing will contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility or ability to access additional capital when needed;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial nonrecurring transaction costs, even if the transaction is not consummated, and additional debt to finance such transaction;\n\u2022\nentry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to successfully integrate acquired operations, personnel, and information systems, and in realizing projected synergies and cost savings, particularly in the case of significant acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of assets and liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for the failure to comply with healthcare laws;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we failed to discover liabilities of an acquired company during our due diligence investigation as part of any acquisition for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible;\n\u2022\nobligations that we may have to joint venture partners and other counterparties of an acquired company that arise as a result of a change in control of an acquired company;\n\u2022\nobligations that we have to holders of our debt securities and to our lenders under our Credit Facilities, including our obligations to comply with financial covenants; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we also may pursue strategic opportunities involving the construction of new facilities. The construction of new facilities involves numerous risks, including construction delays, cost over-runs, and the satisfaction of zoning and other regulatory requirements. We may be unable to operate newly constructed facilities profitably, and such facilities may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, additional operating losses, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur participation in partnerships may negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we operated 24 of our facilities and three home health and hospice agencies through partnerships with unrelated parties. We are the majority owner of most of those partnerships. We may enter into additional partnerships with unrelated parties in the future to acquire, own, or operate IRFs, home health and hospice services, and/or hospitals. Although, we typically control the day-to-day activities of these partnerships, the partnership agreements with our partners often include provisions reserving certain major actions for super-majority approval. Failure to obtain, or delays or substantial time and costs involved in obtaining, our partners\u2019 approval rights, if any, could adversely affect our ability to operate such partnerships, and could have a material adverse effect on such ventures or our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity more generally. Such actions may include entering into a new business activity or ceasing an existing activity, taking on substantial debt, admitting new partners, and terminating the venture. In addition, the partnership agreements may restrict our ability to derive cash from the partnerships and affect our ability to transfer our interest in the partnerships. We may be required to provide additional capital to a partnership if our partner defaults on its capital obligations. Our restrictions to derive cash, transfer our interests, or provide additional funding to these partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. Competition for these individuals is intense and there can be no assurance that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. If we lose the services of one or more of our key officers or employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business, achieve our business objectives, or replace them with similarly qualified personnel. If we lose key personnel, we may be unable to replace them with personnel of comparable experience, reputation in the industry, or skills. The loss of any of our key officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIf we fail to attract patients and compete effectively with other healthcare providers or if our referral sources fail to view us as an attractive or cost-effective post-acute healthcare provider, our revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe post-acute healthcare services industry is highly competitive. Our Kindred at Home and Kindred Rehabilitation Services divisions compete with national, regional, and local home health, hospice, community care and rehabilitation service providers within our markets. Our Kindred at Home and Kindred Rehabilitation Services divisions further operate in industries with little or no barriers to entry in which other healthcare providers may elect to expand their services to include home health, hospice care, community care, rehabilitation or similar services. Several of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than us, may be more established in the markets in which we compete, and may be willing to provide services at lower prices. Our hospitals and IRFs face competition from healthcare providers that provide services comparable to those offered by our hospitals and IRFs. Many competing hospitals or IRFs are larger and more established than us. Some of our competitors operate newer facilities and may offer services not provided by us or are operated by entities having greater financial and other resources than us. We cannot assure you that increased competition in the future will not adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, hospitals, IRFs, nursing centers, assisted living facilities, managed care companies, insurance companies, and other patient referral sources in the communities where we provide services, as well as our ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other healthcare providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer patients to us as a result of the quality of our patient services and our efforts to establish and build a relationship with them. In addition, many of our third party referral sources are becoming increasingly focused on controlling PAC costs, including as a result of bundled payment initiatives, population health management activities, and incentives placed on short-term acute care hospitals to reduce spending on Medicare fee-for-service patients over 90-day episodes of care. If any of our facilities fail to provide or maintain a reputation for providing high quality or cost-effective care, or are perceived to provide lower quality or less cost-effective care than comparable facilities within the same geographic area, or customers of our home health, hospice services, community care, or rehabilitation therapy perceive that they could receive higher quality or more cost-effective services from other providers, our ability to attract and retain patients and customers could be adversely affected. We believe that the perception of our quality of care by potential patients or their families seeking our services is influenced by a variety of factors, including physician and other healthcare professional referrals, community information and referral services, electronic media, newspapers and other print, and results of patient surveys, recommendations from family and friends, and published quality care statistics compiled by CMS or other industry data. If we lose, or fail to maintain, existing relationships with our referral resources, fail to develop new relationships or if we are perceived by our referral sources for any reason as not providing high quality or cost-effective patient care, our patient volumes and the quality of our patient mix could suffer, and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems, or to defend against or otherwise prevent a cybersecurity attack or breach, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are dependent on the proper function and availability of our information systems and related software programs. Though we have taken steps to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the patient health information and other data maintained within those systems, there can be no assurance that our safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our information systems and operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our employees or contractors.\nAs a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating to fewer information systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences.\nIn addition, certain software supporting our business and information systems are licensed to us by third party software developers. Our inability, or the inability of these developers, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems and software could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nA cybersecurity attack or other incident that bypasses our information systems security could cause a security breach that may lead to a material disruption to our information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact our ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation or brand with our patients, referral sources, payors, or other third parties and could subject us to substantial sanctions, fines and damages and other additional civil and criminal penalties under HIPAA, HITECH, the Omnibus Rule and other federal and state privacy laws, in addition to litigation with those affected.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems and related software, or to defend a cybersecurity attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, facilities or patient health information could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, the vast majority of which are not insurable, including but not limited to disruptions in our operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, fines, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the OIG or state attorneys general), fines, litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors and increased operating expense, which either individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThere are risks of business disruption associated with new business systems and technology initiatives.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we implement new business and information technology systems for our various businesses. Implementation disruptions or the failure of new systems and technology initiatives to operate in accordance with expectations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and operations with respect to our operations.\nWe have limited operational and strategic flexibility since we lease a substantial number of our facilities.\nWe lease a substantial number of our facilities from Ventas and other third parties. Under our leases, we generally are required to operate continuously our leased properties as a provider of healthcare services. In addition, these leases generally limit or restrict our ability to assign the lease to another party. Our failure to comply with these lease provisions would result in an event of default under the leases and subject us to material damages, including potential defaults under the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Given these restrictions, we may be forced to continue operating unprofitable facilities to avoid defaults under our leases. For additional information on our Master Lease Agreement, see \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business-Ventas Master Lease Agreement.\u201d\nPossible changes in the acuity of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may significantly affect our profitability.\nThe sources and amount of our revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the occupancy rates of our facilities, the length of stay, the payor mix of patients, rates of reimbursement among payors, and patient acuity. Changes in patient acuity as well as payor mix among private pay, third party payor, Medicare, and Medicaid may significantly affect our profitability. In particular, any significant decrease in our population of high-acuity patients or any significant increase in our Medicaid population could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to reduce costs to offset completely any decreases in our revenues.\nReduced levels of occupancy in our facilities or use of our services and reductions in reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, or other payors would adversely impact our revenues and liquidity. We may be unable to put in place corresponding reductions in costs in response to declines in census or other revenue shortfalls. The inability to timely adjust our operations to address a decrease in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nContinued deficit spending by the federal government, an economic downturn and state budget pressures may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic downturn coupled with sustained unemployment may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nMany states have CON laws or other regulatory provisions that may adversely impact our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and increase net patient service revenue.\nMany states have enacted CON laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities. Those laws require some form of state agency review or approval before a healthcare provider may add new services or undertake significant capital expenditures. Our failure or inability to obtain any necessary approvals could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets.\nTerrorist attacks, pandemics, or natural disasters could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nTerrorist attacks, pandemics, or acts of nature, such as floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes, may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, and our facilities, which could have an adverse impact on our patients. In order to provide care for our patients, we are dependent upon consistent and reliable delivery of food, pharmaceuticals, power, and other products to our facilities and the availability of employees to provide services at our facilities. If the delivery of goods or the ability of employees to reach our facilities were interrupted due to a natural disaster, pandemic, or a terrorist attack, it could have a significant negative impact on our business. Furthermore, the impact, or impending threat, of a natural disaster has in the past and may in the future require that we evacuate one or more facilities, which would be costly and would involve substantial risks to our operations and potentially to our\npatients. The impact of natural disasters, pandemics, and terrorist attacks is inherently uncertain. Such events could severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our business, reputation, and financial performance or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe inability or failure of management in the future to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or the inability of our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report of our internal control over financial reporting, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm also must audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. If we fail to have, or management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that we maintain, effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information as required by the federal securities laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Different interpretations of accounting principles or changes in GAAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nGAAP is complex, continually evolving and changing, and may be subject to varied interpretation by third parties, including the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of GAAP or changes in GAAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe new FASB lease accounting standard is expected to result in a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) has promulgated a new accounting standard that will require public companies to include virtually all lease obligations on their balance sheets for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will not elect early adoption, and as such, we will be required to adopt this new leasing standard as of January 1, 2019 with a modified retrospective application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Given the large number of TC hospitals, IRFs, and home health and hospice locations that we lease, the adoption of this accounting standard is expected to result in a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities.", "PERMNO": 89207, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "KND"}
