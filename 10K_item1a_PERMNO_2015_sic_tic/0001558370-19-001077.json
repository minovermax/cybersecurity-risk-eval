{"cik": "881524", "company": "VIVUS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are not the only risks and uncertainties facing VIVUS. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur success will depend on our ability and that of our current or future collaborators to effectively and profitably commercialize Qsymia\u00ae, PANCREAZE and STENDRA/SPEDRA.\nOur success will depend on our ability and that of our current or future collaborators to effectively and profitably commercialize Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA/SPEDRA, which will include our ability to:\n\u00b7\nexpand the use of Qsymia through targeted patient and physician education;\n\u00b7\nobtain marketing authorization by the EC for Qsiva\u2122 in the EU;\n\u00b7\nmanage our alliances with MTPC, Menarini and Metuchen to help ensure the commercial success of avanafil;\n\u00b7\nmanage costs;\n\u00b7\nimprove third-party payor coverage, lower out-of-pocket costs to patients with discount programs, and obtain coverage for obesity under Medicare Part D;\n\u00b7\ncreate market demand for Qsymia through patient and physician education, marketing and sales activities;\n\u00b7\nachieve market acceptance and generate product sales;\n\u00b7\ncomply with the post-marketing requirements established by FDA, including Qsymia\u2019s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) any future changes to the REMS, and any other requirements established by FDA in the future;\n\u00b7\nefficiently conduct the post-marketing studies required by FDA;\n\u00b7\neffectively and efficiently manage our sales force and commercial team for the promotion of Qsymia and PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\neffectively increase the level of revenue for PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully assume the supply chain and commercial responsibilities for PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\nmaintain a good relationship with the manufacturer of PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\nensure a sufficient level of PANCREAZE inventory;\n\u00b7\nensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) for Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA and the finished products are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of FDA and DEA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with an acceptable quality and pricing level in order to meet commercial demand;\n\u00b7\nensure that the entire supply chain for Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA, from APIs to finished products, efficiently and consistently delivers Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA to customers;\n\u00b7\ncomply with other healthcare regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ncomply with state and federal controlled substances requirements; and\n\u00b7\nmaintain and defend our patents, if challenged.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize Qsymia, PANCREAZE and/or STENDRA/SPEDRA, our ability to generate product sales will be severely limited, which will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a new management team which may cause disruption in our business, which disruption could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2018, former executives of Willow Biopharma Inc. joined our management team, including John Amos as our new Chief Executive Officer, M. Scott Oehrlein as our new Chief Operations Officer and Kenneth Suh as our new President. If we are unable to successfully retain and integrate the new management team, our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop, launch and commercialize tacrolimus or any other potential future development programs.\nWe may not be able to effectively develop and profitably launch and commercialize tacrolimus or any other potential future development programs which we may undertake, which will include our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully develop a proprietary formulation of tacrolimus as a precursor to the clinical development process;\n\u00b7\neffectively conduct phase 2 and phase 3 clinical testing on tacrolimus, which could be delayed by slow patient enrollment, long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness, disruption of operations at clinical trial sites, adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients, failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in the clinical trials, and insufficient clinical trial data to support effectiveness of tacrolimus;\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval and market authorization for tacrolimus in the U.S., EU and other territories;\n\u00b7\ndevelop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d);\n\u00b7\nestablish and effectively manage a supply chain for tacrolimus and future development programs to ensure that the API and the finished products are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with regulatory requirements and with acceptable quality and pricing in order to meet commercial demand;\n\u00b7\neffectively determine and manage the appropriate commercialization strategy;\n\u00b7\nmanage costs;\n\u00b7\nachieve market acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors and generate product sales;\n\u00b7\neffectively compete with other therapies;\n\u00b7\nmaintain a continued acceptable safety profile for tacrolimus following approval;\n\u00b7\ncomply with healthcare regulatory requirements; and\n\u00b7\nmaintain and defend our patents, if challenged.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop, launch and commercialize tacrolimus, our ability to generate product sales will be severely limited, which will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to our strategic business plan may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention, our stock price, and our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn 2018, we initiated a new business strategy. These changes, and the potential for additional changes to our management, organizational structure and strategic business plan, may cause speculation and uncertainty regarding our future business strategy and direction. These changes may cause or result in:\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nstock price volatility; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in negotiating, maintaining or consummating business or strategic relationships or transactions.\nIf we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks, our revenue, operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on our collaboration partners to gain or maintain approval, market, and sell Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA in their respective licensed territories.\nWe rely on our collaboration partners, including Alvogen, Menarini and Metuchen, to successfully commercialize Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA in their respective territories, including obtaining any necessary approvals and we cannot assure you that they will be successful. Our dependence on our collaborative arrangements for the commercialization of Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA, including our license agreements with Alvogen, MTPC, Menarini and Metuchen, subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to control the commercialization of our drug products in the relevant territories, including the amount, timing and quality of resources that our collaborators may devote to our drug products;\n\u00b7\nour collaborators may experience financial, regulatory or operational difficulties, which may impair their ability to commercialize our drug products;\n\u00b7\nour collaborators may be required under the laws of the relevant territories to disclose our confidential information or may fail to protect our confidential information;\n\u00b7\nas a requirement of the collaborative arrangement, we may be required to relinquish important rights with respect to our drug products, such as marketing and distribution rights;\n\u00b7\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to satisfactorily complete its commercialization or other obligations under any collaborative arrangement;\n\u00b7\nlegal disputes or disagreements may occur with one or more of our collaborators;\n\u00b7\na collaborator could independently move forward with a competing investigational drug candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including with one of our competitors; and\n\u00b7\na collaborator could terminate the collaborative arrangement, which could negatively impact the continued commercialization of our drug products. For example, in September 2016, Auxilium terminated its agreement with us to commercialize STENDRA in the U.S. and Canada and, in March 2017, Sanofi terminated its agreement with us to commercialize STENDRA/SPEDRA in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and the CIS, including Russia.\nIn addition, under our license agreement with MTPC, we are obligated to ensure that Menarini, Metuchen, and any future sublicensees comply with the terms and conditions of our license agreement with MTPC, and MTPC has the right to terminate our license rights to avanafil upon any uncured material breach. Consequently, failure by Menarini, Metuchen, or any future sublicensees to comply with these terms and conditions could result in the termination of our license rights to avanafil on a worldwide basis, which would delay, impair, or preclude our ability to commercialize avanafil.\nIf any of our collaboration partners fail to successfully commercialize Qsymia or STENDRA/SPEDRA, our business may be negatively affected and we may receive limited or no revenues under our agreements with them.\nThere have been substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code, some of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2018, some of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition to reducing the top corporate income tax rate, changes that could impact our business in the future include (i) eliminating the ability to utilize net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to reduce income in prior tax years and limiting the utilization of NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 to 80% of future taxable income, which could affect the timing of our ability to utilize NOLs, and (ii) limiting the amount of business interest expenses that can be deducted to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nWe currently rely on reports from our commercialization partners in determining our royalty revenues, and these reports may be subject to adjustment or restatement, which may materially affect our financial results.\nWe have royalty and milestone-bearing license and commercialization agreements for STENDRA/SPEDRA with Menarini and, prior to October 1, 2016, with Auxilium. Also, on an interim basis, we have agreements with affiliates of Janssen for the commercialization of PANCREASE MT in Canada. In determining our royalty revenue from such agreements, we rely on our collaboration partners to provide accounting estimates and reports for various discounts and allowances, including product returns. As a result of fluctuations in inventory, allowances and buying patterns, actual sales and product returns of STENDRA/SPEDRA in particular reporting periods may be affected, resulting in the need for our commercialization partners to adjust or restate their accounting estimates set forth in the reports provided to us. Such adjustments or restatements may materially and negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Beginning October 1, 2016, we ceased earning royalty revenue from U.S. sales as a result of the termination of our license and commercialization agreement with Auxilium. Our new license agreement with Metuchen is royalty-free as to us.\nIf we are unable to enter into agreements with collaborators for the territories that are not covered by our existing commercialization agreements, our ability to commercialize Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA in these territories may be impaired.\nWe intend to enter into collaborative arrangements or a strategic alliance with one or more pharmaceutical partners or others to commercialize Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA in territories that are not covered by our current commercial collaboration agreements. For example, Qsymia is currently licensed for sale only in the U.S. and we have a commercialization agreement to market it in South Korea. STENDRA/SPEDRA is currently not marketed in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, the CIS, Mexico and Central America. We may be unable to enter into agreements with third parties for Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA for these territories on favorable terms or at all, which could delay, impair, or preclude our ability to commercialize Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA in these territories.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nIn order to market products in many foreign jurisdictions, we, or our partners, must obtain separate regulatory approvals. Approval by FDA in the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. For example, while our drug STENDRA/SPEDRA has been approved in both the U.S. and the EU, our drug Qsymia has been approved in the U.S. but Qsiva (the intended trade name for Qsymia in the EU) was denied a marketing authorization by the EC due to concerns over the potential cardiovascular and central nervous system effects associated with long-term use, teratogenic potential and use by patients for whom Qsiva would not have been indicated. We intend to seek approval, either directly or through our collaboration partners, for Qsymia and STENDRA in other territories outside the U.S. and the EU. However, we have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing. Foreign regulatory approvals may not be obtained, by us or our collaboration partners responsible for obtaining approval, on a timely basis, or at all, for any of our products. The failure to receive regulatory approvals in a foreign country would prevent us from marketing and commercializing our products in that country, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, together with Alvogen, Menarini, Metuchen, Janssen and any potential future collaborators in certain territories, intend to market Qsymia, PANCREAZE/PANCREASE and STENDRA/SPEDRA outside the U.S., which will subject us to risks related to conducting business internationally.\nWe, through Alvogen, Menarini, Metuchen and any potential future collaborators in certain territories, intend to manufacture, market, and distribute Qsymia, PANCREAZE/PANCREASE and STENDRA/SPEDRA outside the U.S. Also, on an interim basis, we have agreements with affiliates of Janssen for the commercialization of PANCREASE MT in Canada. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to conducting business internationally, including:\n\u00b7\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incidental to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u00b7\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nWe have significant inventories on hand, and, in 2015, we recorded inventory impairment and commitment fees totaling $29.5 million, primarily to write off excess inventory related to Qsymia.\nWe maintain significant inventories and evaluate these inventories on a periodic basis for potential excess and obsolescence. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized total charges of $29.5 million, primarily for Qsymia inventories on hand in excess of projected demand. The inventory impairment charges were based on our analysis of the then-current Qsymia inventory on hand and remaining shelf life, in relation to our projected demand for the product. The current FDA-approved commercial product shelf life for Qsymia is 36 months. STENDRA is approved in the U.S. and SPEDRA is approved in the EU for 48 months of commercial product shelf life.\nOur write-down for excess and obsolete inventory is subjective and requires forecasting of the future market demand for our products. Forecasting demand for Qsymia, a drug in the obesity market in which there had been no new FDA-approved medications in over a decade prior to 2012, and for which reimbursement from third-party payors had previously been non-existent, has been difficult. PANCREAZE has a short shelf life and forecasting both the amounts and the timing of demand for PANCREAZE is difficult. Forecasting demand for STENDRA/SPEDRA, a drug that is new to a crowded and competitive market and has limited sales history, is also difficult. We will continue to evaluate our inventories on a periodic basis. The value of our inventories could be impacted if actual sales differ significantly from our estimates of future demand or if any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions occur. Any of these events, or a combination thereof, could result in additional inventory write-downs in future periods, which could be material.\nOur failure to manage and maintain our distribution network for Qsymia or compliance with certain requirements, including requirements of the Qsymia REMS program, could compromise the commercialization of this product.\nWe rely on Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (\u201cCardinal Health\u201d) a third-party distribution and supply-chain management company, to warehouse Qsymia and distribute it to the certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers that then distribute Qsymia directly to patients and certified retail pharmacies. Cardinal Health provides billing, collection and returns services. Cardinal Health is our exclusive supplier of distribution logistics services, and accordingly we depend on Cardinal Health to satisfactorily perform its obligations under our agreement with them, including compliance with relevant state and federal laws.\nPursuant to the REMS program applicable to Qsymia, our distribution network is through a small number of certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers and through a broader network of certified retail pharmacies. We have contracted through a third-party vendor to certify the retail pharmacies and collect required data to support the Qsymia REMS program. In addition to providing services to support the distribution and use of Qsymia, each of the certified pharmacies has agreed to comply with the REMS program requirements and, through our third-party data collection vendor, will provide us with the necessary patient and prescribing healthcare provider (\u201cHCP\u201d) data. In addition, we have contracted with third-party data warehouses to store this patient and HCP data and report it to us. We rely on this third-party data in order to recognize revenue and comply with the REMS requirements for Qsymia, such as data analysis. This distribution and data collection network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, finance, regulatory and medical affairs teams, in light of the REMS requirements applicable to Qsymia.\nWe rely on the certified pharmacies to implement a number of safety procedures and report certain information to our third-party REMS data collection vendor. Failure to maintain our contracts with Cardinal Health, our third-party REMS data collection vendor, or with the third-party data warehouses, or the inability or failure of any of them to adequately perform under our contracts with them, could negatively impact the distribution of Qsymia, or adversely affect our ability to comply with the REMS applicable to Qsymia. Failure to comply with a requirement of an approved REMS can result in, among other things, civil penalties, imposition of additional burdensome REMS requirements,\nsuspension or revocation of regulatory approval and criminal prosecution. Failure to coordinate financial systems could also negatively impact our ability to accurately report and forecast product revenue. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution and data collection process, sales of Qsymia could be severely compromised and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with suppliers or our suppliers fail to supply us with the APIs for our products or finished products or if we rely on single-source suppliers, we may experience delays in commercializing our products.\nWe purchase all supplies related to PANCREAZE from a single manufacturer. We currently do not have supply agreements for topiramate or phentermine, which are the APIs used in Qsymia. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining or entering into supply agreements on reasonable terms or at all or that we or our suppliers will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or state and federal controlled substances registrations for current or potential future suppliers in a timely manner or at all.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to rely on single-source suppliers for PANCREAZE, phentermine and topiramate for the foreseeable future. Any production shortfall on the part of our suppliers that impairs the supply of phentermine, topiramate or PANCREAZE could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these compounds, there could be a substantial delay in successfully developing a second source supplier. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for Qsymia or PANCREAZE, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe currently do not have any manufacturing facilities and intend to continue to rely on third parties for the supply of the API and tablets, as well as for the supply of starting materials. However, we cannot be certain that we or our suppliers will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or registrations for these suppliers in a timely manner or at all.\nSanofi Chimie manufactures and supplies the API for avanafil on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi-exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. Sanofi Winthrop Industrie manufactures and supplies the avanafil tablets on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi-exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. We have entered into supply agreements with Menarini and Metuchen under which we are obligated to supply them with avanafil tablets. If we are unable to maintain a reliable supply of avanafil API or tablets from Sanofi Chimie and/or Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under these supply agreements in a timely manner or at all, and we may, as a result, be in breach of one or both of these agreements.\nWe have in-licensed all or a portion of the rights to Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA from third parties. If we default on any of our material obligations under those licenses, we could lose rights to these drugs.\nWe have in-licensed and otherwise contracted for rights to Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA, and we may enter into similar licenses in the future. Under the relevant agreements, we are subject to commercialization, development, supply, sublicensing, royalty, insurance and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, or otherwise breach these license agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license. Loss of any of these licenses or the exclusive rights provided therein could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIn particular, we license the rights to avanafil from MTPC, and we have certain obligations to MTPC in connection with that license. We licensed the rights to PANCREAZE from Janssen. We license the rights to Qsymia from Dr. Najarian. We believe we are in compliance with the material terms of our license agreements with MTPC, Janssen and Dr. Najarian. However, there can be no assurance that this compliance will continue or that the licensors will not have a differing interpretation of the material terms of the agreements. If the license agreements were terminated early or if the terms of the licenses were contested for any reason, it would have a material adverse impact on our ability\nto commercialize products subject to these agreements, our ability to raise funds to finance our operations, our stock price and our overall financial condition. The monetary and disruption costs of any disputes involving our agreements could be significant despite rulings in our favor.\nOur ability to gain and increase market acceptance and generate revenues will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nQsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA/SPEDRA may not gain or increase market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such drugs will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to expand the use of Qsymia through targeted patient and physician education;\n\u00b7\nour ability to find the right partner for expanded Qsymia commercial promotion to a broader primary care physician audience;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain marketing authorization by the EC for Qsiva in the EU;\n\u00b7\ncontraindications for Qsymia and STENDRA/SPEDRA;\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase market acceptance for and use of PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\ncompetition and timing of market introduction of competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nquality, safety and efficacy in the approved setting;\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of any side effects, including those of the components of our drugs;\n\u00b7\nemergence of previously unknown side effects, including those of the generic components of our drugs;\n\u00b7\nresults of any post-approval studies;\n\u00b7\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments, including generics;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration and dosing schedule;\n\u00b7\nthe convenience and ease of purchasing the drug, as perceived by potential patients;\n\u00b7\nstrength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nprice, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or our current or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe level of mandatory discounts required under federal and state healthcare programs and the volume of sales subject to those discounts;\n\u00b7\nrecommendations for prescribing physicians to complete certain educational programs for prescribing drugs;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of government or third-party coverage; and\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling, product insert, or new REMS or post-market safety study or trial requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nOur drugs may fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenue to achieve sustainable profitability. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the safety and benefits of our drugs may require significant resources and may not be successful.\nWe are required to complete post-approval studies and trials mandated by FDA for Qsymia, and such studies and trials are expected to be costly and time consuming. If the results of these studies and trials reveal unacceptable safety risks, Qsymia may be subject to additional REMS restrictions or required to be withdrawn from the market.\nUpon receiving approval to market Qsymia, FDA required that we perform additional studies of Qsymia including a cardiovascular outcome trial (\u201cCVOT\u201d). We estimate the cost of a CVOT as currently designed to be between $180.0 million and $220.0 million incurred over a period of approximately five years. We have held several meetings with FDA to discuss alternative strategies for obtaining cardiovascular (\u201cCV\u201d) outcomes data that would be substantially more feasible and that ensure timely collection of data to better inform on the CV safety of Qsymia. In September 2013, we submitted a request to the EMA for Scientific Advice, a procedure similar to the U.S. Special Protocol Assessment process, regarding use of a pre-specified interim analysis from the CVOT to assess the long-term treatment effect of Qsymia on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight and obese subjects with confirmed cardiovascular disease. Our request was to allow this interim analysis to support the resubmission of an application for a marketing authorization for Qsiva for treatment of obesity in accordance with the EU centralized marketing authorization procedure. We received feedback in 2014 from the EMA and the various competent authorities of the EU Member States. We worked with cardiovascular and epidemiology experts in exploring alternate solutions to demonstrate the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. After reviewing a summary of Phase 3 data relevant to CV risk and post-marketing safety data, the cardiology experts noted that they believe there was an absence of an overt CV risk signal and indicated that they did not believe a randomized placebo-controlled CVOT would provide additional information regarding the CV risk of Qsymia. The epidemiology experts maintained that a well-conducted retrospective observational study could provide data to further inform on potential CV risk. We worked with the expert group to develop a protocol and conduct a retrospective observational study. We have submitted information from this study to FDA in support of a currently pending supplemental New Drug Application (\u201csNDA\u201d) seeking changes to the Qsymia label. Although we and consulted experts believe there is no overt signal for CV risk to justify the CVOT, we are committed to working with FDA to reach a resolution. There is no assurance, however, that FDA will accept any measures short of those specified in the CVOT to satisfy this requirement.\nAs for the EU, even if FDA were to determine that a CVOT is no longer necessary, there would be no assurance that the EMA would reach the same conclusion. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining FDA or EMA agreement that we have demonstrated the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that FDA or EMA will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials or retrospective observational studies.\nIn addition to these studies, FDA may also require us to perform other lengthy post-approval studies or trials, for which we would have to expend significant additional resources, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and stock price. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including the completion of post-marketing studies and trials, can result in, among other things, civil monetary penalties, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. We have not complied with all the regulatory timelines for the required post-marketing trials and studies, and this may be considered a violation of the statute if FDA does not find good cause.\nWe depend upon consultants and outside contractors extensively in important roles within our company.\nWe outsource many key functions of our business and therefore rely on a substantial number of consultants, and we will need to be able to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. However, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our regulatory obligations, clinical trials or other development activities may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to complete our post-approval clinical trials or other development activities for Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA, obtain regulatory approval for our future investigational drug candidates, successfully commercialize our approved drugs or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nQsymia is a combination of two active ingredient drug products approved individually by FDA that are commercially available and marketed by other companies, although the specific dose strengths differ. As a result, Qsymia may be subject to substitution by prescribing physicians, or by pharmacists, with individual drugs contained in the Qsymia formulation, which would adversely affect our business.\nAlthough Qsymia is a once-a-day, proprietary extended-release formulation, both of the approved APIs (phentermine and topiramate) that are combined to produce Qsymia are commercially available as drug products at prices that together are lower than the price at which we sell Qsymia. In addition, the distribution and sale of these drug products is not limited under a REMS program, as is the case with Qsymia. Further, the individual drugs contained in the Qsymia formulation are available in retail pharmacies. We cannot be sure that physicians will view Qsymia as sufficiently superior to a treatment regimen of Qsymia\u2019s individual APIs to justify the significantly higher cost for Qsymia, and they may prescribe the individual generic drugs already approved and marketed by other companies instead of our combination drug. Although our U.S. and European patents contain composition, product formulation and method-of-use claims that we believe protect Qsymia, these patents may be ineffective or impractical to prevent physicians from prescribing, or pharmacists from dispensing, the individual generic constituents marketed by other companies instead of our combination drug. Phentermine and topiramate are currently available in generic form, although the doses used in Qsymia are currently not available. In the third quarter of 2013, Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched Trokendi XR\u2122 and in the second quarter of 2014, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. launched Qudexy\u2122. Both products provide an extended-release formulation of the generic drug topiramate that is indicated for certain types of seizures and migraines. Topiramate is not approved for obesity treatment, and phentermine is only approved for short-term treatment of obesity. However, because the price of Qsymia is significantly higher than the prices of the individual components as marketed by other companies, physicians may have a greater incentive to write prescriptions for the individual components outside of their approved indication, instead of for our combination drug, and this may limit how we price or market Qsymia. Similar concerns could also limit the reimbursement amounts private health insurers or government agencies in the U.S. are prepared to pay for Qsymia, which could also limit market and patient acceptance of our drug and could negatively impact our revenues.\nIn many regions and countries where we may plan to market Qsymia, the pricing of reimbursed prescription drugs is controlled by the government or regulatory agencies. The government or regulatory agencies in these countries could determine that the pricing for Qsymia should be based on prices for its APIs when sold separately, rather than allowing us to market Qsymia at a premium as a new drug, which could limit our pricing of Qsymia and negatively impact our revenues.\nOnce an applicant receives authorization to market a medicinal product in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate pricing authority in that country. The legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU Member States continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices pharmaceutical companies are able to charge for their products. The amounts of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or third-party payors for these products may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies such as ours, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Furthermore, an increasing number of EU Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in the price of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. In addition, the ongoing budgetary difficulties faced by a number of EU Member States, including Greece and Spain, have led and may continue to lead to substantial delays in payment and payment partially with government bonds rather than cash for medicinal products, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement of our medicinal products in some countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our medicinal products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country. For more information concerning pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the EU and, in particular, the impact of HTA, please refer to the section titled \u201cGovernment Regulation - Coverage and Reimbursement.\u201d\nIf we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nQsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA/SPEDRA, like all pharmaceutical products, are subject to heightened risk for product liability claims due to inherent potential side effects. For example, because topiramate, a component of Qsymia, may increase the risk of congenital malformation in infants exposed to topiramate during the first trimester of pregnancy and also may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such risks may be associated with Qsymia as well. Other potential risks involving Qsymia may include, but are not limited to, an increase in resting heart rate, acute angle closure glaucoma, cognitive and psychiatric adverse events, metabolic acidosis, an increase in serum creatinine, hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, kidney stone formation, decreased sweating and hypokalemia, or lower-than-normal amount of potassium in the blood.\nAlthough we have obtained product liability insurance coverage for Qsymia, we may be unable to maintain this product liability coverage for Qsymia or any other of our approved drugs in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential risks. A product liability claim in excess of, or excluded from, our insurance coverage would have to be paid out of cash reserves and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product liability insurance is expensive even with large self-insured retentions or deductibles, difficult to maintain, and current or increased coverage may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn addition, we develop, test, and manufacture through third parties, approved drugs and future investigational drug candidates that are used by humans. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates in clinical trials. An individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our approved drugs or future investigational drug candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against a product liability claim, whether involving Qsymia, PANCREAZE, STENDRA/SPEDRA or a future investigational drug candidate or product, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial patients;\n\u00b7\ncosts of defending the claim and/or related litigation;\n\u00b7\ncost of any potential adverse verdict;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our drugs.\nDamages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition. Whether or not we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. In addition, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety or efficacy of our product, our third-party manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs. An FDA investigation could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the indications for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approval.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants or established companies.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly and extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies for the treatment of obesity and erectile dysfunction. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than we do. Some of the drugs that may compete with Qsymia may not have a REMS requirement and the accompanying complexities such a requirement presents. Our competitors may develop technologies\nand products that are more effective than those we are currently marketing or researching and developing. Such developments could render Qsymia and STENDRA less competitive or possibly obsolete.\nQsymia for the treatment of chronic weight management competes with several approved anti-obesity drugs including, Belviq\u00ae (lorcaserin), marketed by Eisai Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd.\u2019s U.S. subsidiary; Xenical\u00ae (orlistat), marketed by Roche; alli\u00ae, the over-the-counter version of orlistat, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline; Contrave\u00ae (naltrexone/bupropion), Nalpropion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s anti-obesity compound; and Saxenda\u00ae (liraglutide), an anti-obesity compound marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S. Agents that have been approved for type 2 diabetes that have demonstrated weight loss in clinical studies may also compete with Qsymia. These include Farxiga\u2122 (dapagliflozin) from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb, an SGLT2 inhibitor; Jardiance\u00ae (empagliflozin) from Boehringer Ingelheim, an SGLT2 inhibitor; Victoza\u00ae (liraglutide) from Novo Nordisk A/S, a GLP-1 receptor agonist; Invokana\u00ae (canaglifozin) from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an SGLT2 inhibitor and Glyxambi\u00ae (empagliflozin/linagliptin) from Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, an SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor combination product. Also, EnteroMedics\u00ae Inc. markets the Maestro Rechargeable System for certain obese adults, the first weight loss treatment device that targets the nerve pathway between the brain and the stomach that controls feelings of hunger and fullness.\nThere are also several other investigational drug candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of obesity. There are also a number of generic pharmaceutical drugs that are prescribed for obesity, predominantly phentermine. Phentermine is sold at much lower prices than we charge for Qsymia. The availability of branded prescription drugs, generic drugs and over-the-counter drugs could limit the demand for, and the price we are able to charge for, Qsymia.\nWe also may face competition from the off-label use of the generic components in our drugs. In particular, it is possible that patients will seek to acquire phentermine and topiramate, the generic components of Qsymia. Neither of these generic components has a REMS program and both are available at retail pharmacies. Although the dose strength of these generic components has not been approved by FDA for use in the treatment of obesity, the off-label use of the generic components in the U.S. or the importation of the generic components from foreign markets could adversely affect the commercial potential for our drugs and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are also surgical approaches to treat severe obesity that are becoming increasingly accepted. Two of the most well established surgical procedures are gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric banding, or lap bands. In February 2011, FDA approved the use of a lap band in patients with a BMI of 30 (reduced from 35) with comorbidities. The lowering of the BMI requirement will make more obese patients eligible for these types of bariatric procedures. In addition, other potential approaches that utilize various implantable devices or surgical tools are in development. Some of these approaches are in late-stage development and may be approved for marketing.\nQsymia may also face challenges and competition from newly developed generic products. Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act stimulates competition by providing incentives to generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to introduce non-infringing forms of patented pharmaceutical products and to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products. We received two notifications under paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act challenging certain of our Qsymia patents, and we filed suit against both challengers. In June 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., Actavis, Inc., and Actavis PLC, collectively referred to as \u201cActavis,\u201d and in August 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, S.A. and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc., collectively referred to as \u201cDRL.\u201d The settlement agreement with Actavis will permit Actavis to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on December 1, 2024, or earlier under certain circumstances. The settlement agreement with DRL will permit DRL to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on June 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. It is possible that one or more additional companies may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) and could receive FDA approval to market a generic version of Qsymia before the entry dates specified in our settlement agreements with Actavis and DRL. If a generic version of Qsymia is launched, this will harm our business. Generic manufacturers pursuing ANDA approval are not required to conduct costly and time-consuming clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their products; rather, they are permitted to rely on FDA\u2019s finding that the innovator\u2019s product is safe and effective. Additionally, generic drug companies generally do not expend significant sums on sales and marketing activities, instead relying on physicians or payors to substitute the generic form of a drug for the branded form. Thus, generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies\nwho have incurred substantial expenses associated with the research and development of the drug product and who must spend significant sums marketing a new drug.\nThe FDCA provides that an ANDA holder and an innovator drug with a REMS with Elements to Assure Safe use, like Qsymia, must use a single shared REMS system to assure safe use unless FDA waives this requirement and permits the ANDA holder to implement a separate but comparable REMS. We cannot predict the outcome or impact on our business of any future action that we may take with regard to sharing our REMS program or if FDA grants a waiver allowing the generic competitor to market a generic drug with a separate but comparable REMS.\nPANCREAZE for the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency competes with Creon\u00ae, marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Zenpep\u00ae, marketed by Allergan Inc., Pertzye\u00ae, marketed by Digestive Care, Inc., and UltresaTM, marketed by Aptalis Phama US, Inc.\nSTENDRA for the treatment of ED competes with PDE5 inhibitors in the form of oral medications including Viagra\u00ae (sildenafil citrate), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Cialis\u00ae (tadalafil), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company; Levitra\u00ae (vardenafil), co-marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Schering-Plough Corporation in the U.S.; and STAXYN\u00ae (vardenafil in an oral disintegrating tablet (\u201cODT\u201d)), co-promoted by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck & Co., Inc. Additionally, generic formulations of sildenafil citrate and tadalafil are currently available on the market and, on January 3, 2017, we granted Hetero a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of STENDRA described in its ANDA filing in the United States as of the date that is the later of (a) October 29, 2024, which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit, or (b) the date that Hetero obtains final approval from FDA of the Hetero ANDA.\nNew developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our drugs and future investigational drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u00b7\nresearch and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u00b7\nregulatory experience;\n\u00b7\ninvestigational drug candidate development and clinical trial experience;\n\u00b7\nexperience and expertise in exploitation of intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7\naccess to strategic partners and capital resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our future investigational drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs or surgical approaches that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may be more effective in commercializing their products. We currently outsource our manufacturing and therefore rely on third parties for that competitive expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for these capabilities on acceptable economic terms, or at all.\nWe may participate in new partnerships and other strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we consider strategic transactions, such as out-licensing or in-licensing of compounds or technologies, acquisitions of companies and asset purchases. On September 30, 2016, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement and a commercial supply agreement with Metuchen. Under the terms of the agreements, Metuchen received an exclusive license to develop, commercialize and promote STENDRA in the United States, Canada, South America and India (the \u201cTerritory\u201d) effective October 1, 2016. Additionally, on January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. Also, on June 8, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of PANCREAZE from Janssen, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to PANCREAZE and PANCREASE MT in the U.S. and Canada. Further potential transactions we may consider include a\nvariety of different business arrangements, including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, spin-offs, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. In addition, another entity may pursue us as an acquisition target. Any such transactions may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges, require additional expertise or disrupt our management or business, any of which could harm our operations and financial results.\nAs part of an effort to enter into significant transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the expected benefits of the transaction. If we fail to realize the expected benefits from any transaction we may consummate, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks or other events, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to successfully identify, acquire, develop and market additional investigational drug candidates or approved drugs would impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire, in-license, develop and/or market additional products and investigational drug candidates. Most recently, on June 8, 2018, we closed on the acquisition of PANCREAZE from Janssen, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to PANCREAZE and PANCREASE MT in the U.S. and Canada. Also, on January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. Because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical investigational drug candidates and products.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of an investigational drug candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of investigational drug candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional investigational drug candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nhigher than expected acquisition, integration and maintenance costs;\n\u00b7\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u00b7\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nFurther, any investigational drug candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and obtaining approval by FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All investigational drug candidates are prone to certain failures that are relatively common in the field of\ndrug development, including the possibility that an investigational drug candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot be certain that any drugs that we develop or approved products that we may acquire will be commercialized profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel and hire, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could result in reduced revenues or delays in the development of our investigational drug candidates or commercialization of our approved drugs.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the skills of a limited number of key management personnel. To reach our business objectives, we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel in the areas of manufacturing, commercial operations, research and development, regulatory and legal affairs, business development, clinical trial design, execution and analysis, and pre-clinical testing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire such personnel, as we must compete with other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other agencies. The loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain necessary new employees could have an adverse effect on our research programs, investigational drug candidate development, approved drug commercialization efforts and business operations.\nWe rely on third parties and collaborative partners to manufacture sufficient quantities of compounds within product specifications as required by regulatory agencies for use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials and commercial operations and an interruption to this service may harm our business.\nWe do not have the ability to manufacture the materials we use in our pre-clinical and clinical trials and commercial operations. Rather, we rely on various third parties to manufacture these materials and there may be long lead times to obtain materials. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, contract with, qualify and obtain prior regulatory approval for additional sources of clinical materials. If interruptions in this supply occur for any reason, including a decision by the third parties to discontinue manufacturing, technical difficulties, labor disputes, natural or other disasters, or a failure of the third parties to follow regulations, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates and may not be able to successfully commercialize these investigational drug candidates or our approved drugs.\nOur third-party manufacturers and collaborative partners may encounter delays and problems in manufacturing our approved drugs or investigational drug candidates for a variety of reasons, including accidents during operation, failure of equipment, delays in receiving materials, natural or other disasters, political or governmental changes, or other factors inherent in operating complex manufacturing facilities. Supply-chain management is difficult. Commercially available starting materials, reagents, excipients, and other materials may become scarce, more expensive to procure, or not meet quality standards, and we may not be able to obtain favorable terms in agreements with subcontractors. Our third-party manufacturers may not be able to operate manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs. If our third-party manufacturers, cease or interrupt production or if our third-party manufacturers and other service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, such interruption could delay progress on our programs, or interrupt the commercial supply, with the potential for additional costs and lost revenues. If this were to occur, we may also need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs.\nFor example, Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (\u201cCatalent\u201d) is our sole source of clinical and commercial supplies for Qsymia. While Catalent has significant experience in commercial scale manufacturing, there is no assurance that Catalent will be successful in continuing to supply Qsymia at current levels or increasing the scale of the Qsymia manufacturing process, should the market demand for Qsymia expand beyond the level supportable by the current validated manufacturing process. Such a failure by Catalent to meet current demand or to further scale up the commercial manufacturing process for Qsymia could have a material adverse impact on our ability to realize commercial success with Qsymia in the U.S. market, and have a material adverse impact on our plan, market price of our common stock and financial condition.\nFor PANCREAZE, Nordmark is our sole source of clinical and commercial supplies. Nordmark has significant experience in manufacturing; however, there is no assurance that they will continue to be successful in supplying\nPANCREAZE in the future or if we will be able to continue our relationship with Nordmark on favorable terms to us for any future formulations and quantities.\nFor avanafil, Sanofi Chimie manufactures and supplies the API for avanafil on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi-exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. Sanofi Winthrop Industrie manufactures and supplies the avanafil tablets for STENDRA and SPEDRA on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi-exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. Sanofi is responsible for all aspects of manufacture, including obtaining the starting materials for the production of API. If Sanofi is unable to manufacture the API or tablets in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, future sales could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our financial results, our license, commercialization, and supply agreements with our collaboration partners, and our ability to enter into a collaboration agreement for the commercialization in other territories.\nAny failure of current or future manufacturing sites, including those of Sanofi Chimie and Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, to receive or maintain approval from FDA or foreign authorities, obtain and maintain ongoing FDA or foreign regulatory compliance, or manufacture avanafil API or tablets in expected quantities could have a detrimental impact on our ability to commercialize STENDRA under our agreements with Menarini and Metuchen and our ability to enter into a collaboration agreement for the commercialization of STENDRA in our other territories not covered by our agreements with Menarini and Metuchen.\nWe rely on third parties to maintain appropriate levels of confidentiality of the data compiled during clinical, pre-clinical and retrospective observational studies and trials.\nWe seek to maintain the confidential nature of our confidential information through contractual provisions in our agreements with third parties, including our agreements with clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) that manage our clinical studies for our investigational drug candidates. These CROs may fail to comply with their obligations of confidentiality or may be required as a matter of law to disclose our confidential information. As the success of our clinical studies depends in large part on our confidential information remaining confidential prior to, during and after a clinical study, any disclosure or breach affecting that information could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of a clinical study, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we intend to launch the VIVUS Healthcare Platform in 2019, which will provide current and potential customers with an integrated online approach to weight management.\nThe collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting and substantial fines and other administrative penalties. Compliance with the GDPR may be onerous and increase our cost of doing business. For more information concerning the data protection requirements in the EU and the EU Member States and the rules governing the transfer of personal data to the U.S., please refer to the section title \u201cGovernment Regulation - Fraud and Abuse and Privacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations.\u201d\nIf we fail to comply with applicable healthcare and privacy and data security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties, liability and adverse publicity and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur arrangements with third-party payors, patients and customers expose us to broadly applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse. In addition, our operations expose us to privacy and data security laws and regulations. The restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and privacy and data security laws and regulations, that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare\nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. Moreover, the anti-kickback statute is subject to evolving interpretation and there are no safe harbors for many common practices, including patient or product support programs, educational and research grants, or charitable donations. We seek to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability;\n\u00b7\nthe federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals and entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the U.S. Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. More recently, federal enforcement agencies are and have been investigating certain pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services, relationships with specialty pharmacies, and grants to independent charitable foundations. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs;\n\u00b7\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nnumerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), for example, is an EU-wide regulation that imposes restrictions on the processing (e.g., collection, use, disclosure) of personal data and that also imposes strict restrictions on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) which are collectively\nreferred to as \u201cHIPAA.\u201d We are not a HIPAA-covered entity and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, the HIPAA privacy and security requirements do not apply to us (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits). However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to commit a violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. These privacy and data security laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business;\n\u00b7\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain healthcare providers in the states. Other states prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing-related activities and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. Some states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other states and cities require identification or licensing of state representatives. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Foreign governments often have similar regulations, which we also will be subject to in those countries where we market and sell products;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related payments and other transfers of value, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and\n\u00b7\nthe federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, candidates for foreign political office, or public international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. and foreign regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.\nState and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the U.S. Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal healthcare laws, including the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be\nsubject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid (i.e., loss of coverage for products), and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations including by entering into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or associated adverse publicity, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy data, security and fraud laws and regulations may prove costly.\nIn the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU Member States\u2019 laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation governing statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption. Failure to comply with these rules can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including but not limited to trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including but not limited to trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nMarketing activities for our approved drugs are subject to continued governmental regulation.\nFDA, and third-country authorities, including the competent authorities of the EU Member States, have the authority to impose significant restrictions, including REMS requirements, on approved products through regulations on advertising, promotional and distribution activities. After approval, if products are marketed in contradiction with FDA laws and regulations, FDA may issue warning letters that require specific remedial measures to be taken, as well as an\nimmediate cessation of the impermissible conduct, resulting in adverse publicity. FDA may also require that all future promotional materials receive prior agency review and approval before use. Certain states have also adopted regulations and reporting requirements surrounding the promotion of pharmaceuticals. Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA are subject to these regulations. Failure by us or any of our collaborators to comply with state requirements may affect our ability to promote or sell pharmaceutical drugs in certain states. This, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and financial condition and could subject us to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense or limit our ability to commercialize our drugs.\nWe are required to comply with extensive regulations for drug manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping in connection with the marketing of Qsymia and STENDRA. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the investigational drug candidates or to whom and how we may distribute our products. Even after FDA approval is obtained, FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a drug\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for REMS or potentially costly post-approval studies. For example, the labeling approved for Qsymia includes restrictions on use, including recommendations for pregnancy testing, level of obesity and duration of treatment. We are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions that may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize Qsymia. FDA has also required the distribution of a Medication Guide to Qsymia patients outlining the increased risk of teratogenicity with fetal exposure and the possibility of suicidal thinking or behavior. In addition, FDA has required a REMS that may act to limit access to the drug, reduce our revenues and/or increase our costs. FDA may modify the Qsymia REMS in the future to be more or less restrictive.\nIn addition, Qsymia is a controlled substance and subject to DEA and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution and prescription procedures and requirements related to necessary DEA registrations and state licenses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA, relevant state authorities or any comparable international requirements could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties, and could result in, among other things, additional operating costs to us or delays in distribution of Qsymia and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEven if we maintain FDA approval, or receive a marketing authorization from the EC, and other regulatory approvals, if we or others identify adverse side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval or EU marketing authorization may be varied, suspended or withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling and additional marketing applications may be required, any of which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing of our products.\nAll of those involved in the preparation of a therapeutic drug for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing supply contract manufacturers, and clinical trial investigators, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished drug product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with current cGMP. These regulations govern quality control of the manufacturing processes and documentation policies and procedures, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of our third-party contractors must be inspected routinely for compliance. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the issuance of a warning letter, temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales, recalls, market withdrawals, seizures, or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures would be imposed upon us or third parties\nwith whom we contract until satisfactory cGMP compliance is achieved. FDA could also impose civil penalties. We must also comply with similar regulatory requirements of foreign regulatory agencies.\nWe obtain the necessary raw materials and components for the manufacture of Qsymia and STENDRA as well as certain services, such as analytical testing packaging and labeling, from third parties. In particular, we rely on Catalent to supply Qsymia capsules and Packaging Coordinators, Inc. (\u201cPCI\u201d) for Qsymia packaging services. We rely on Sanofi Chimie and Sanofi Winthrop to supply avanafil API and tablets. We and these suppliers and service providers are required to follow cGMP requirements and are subject to routine and unannounced inspections by FDA and by state and foreign regulatory agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other applicable regulations. Upon inspection of these facilities, FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may find the manufacturing process or facilities are not in compliance with cGMP requirements and other regulations. Because manufacturing processes are highly complex and are subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified supply may not be available on a timely basis or at all.\nDifficulties, problems or delays in our suppliers and service providers\u2019 manufacturing and supply of raw materials, components and services could delay our clinical trials, increase our costs, damage our reputation and cause us to lose revenue or market share if we are unable to timely meet market demands.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Effective in March 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well. With regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non-innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation changed the definition of average manufacturer price. Finally, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government beginning in 2011. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.\nCMS issued final regulations that became effective on April 1, 2016 to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the\nMedicaid Drug Rebate program has and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will be time consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act, but exempts \u201corphan drugs\u201d from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act and CMS\u2019s issuance of final regulations implementing those changes also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d), which administers the 340B program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation. Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. HRSA also is implementing a 340B ceiling price reporting requirement during the first quarter of 2019 pursuant to which we are required to report the 340B ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the 340B ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, and we may be required to issue refunds to covered entities.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nCMS and the Office of the Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIf we misstate Non-FAMPs or FCPs, we must restate these figures. Additionally, pursuant to the VHCA, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject us to penalties of $181,071\nfor each item of false information. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or the Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nChanges in reimbursement procedures by government and other third-party payors, including changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, may limit our ability to market and sell our approved drugs, or any future drugs, if approved, may limit our product revenues and delay profitability, and may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn the U.S. and abroad, sales of pharmaceutical drugs are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third-party payor benefit packages restrict reimbursement, charge co-pays to patients, or do not provide coverage for specific drugs or drug classes.\nIn addition, certain healthcare providers are moving towards a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare services, including prescription drugs, for a fixed cost per person. We are unable to predict the reimbursement policies employed by third-party healthcare payors.\nPayors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and Actual Acquisition Cost. CMS, the federal agency that administers Medicare and the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products.\nThe healthcare industry in the U.S. and abroad is undergoing fundamental changes that are the result of political, economic and regulatory influences. The levels of revenue and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce healthcare costs through various means. Reforms that have been and may be considered include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the increase in private health insurance premiums and the types of drugs eligible for reimbursement and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. These include measures that limit or prohibit payments for some medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control and regulations changing the rebates we are required to provide, and proposals that would do so. Further, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near-term. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2027. These cuts reduce reimbursement payments related to our products, which could potentially negatively impact our revenue.\nIn March 2010, the President signed the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and could have a material adverse effect on our future business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, including by operation of the following provisions:\n\u00b7\nEffective in March 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well.\n\u00b7\nWith regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non-innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that\nqualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price.\n\u00b7\nEffective in January 2011, pharmaceutical companies were required to provide a 50 percent discount on branded prescription drugs dispensed to beneficiaries during their Medicare Part D coverage gap period or \u201cdonut hole,\u201d which is a coverage gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. The BBA increased such manufacturer point-of-sale discounts to 70% effective as of January 1, 2019. We currently do not have coverage under Medicare Part D for our drugs, but this could change in the future.\n\u00b7\nEffective in January 2011, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay an annual, nondeductible, branded prescription drug fee to the federal government, which is apportioned among pharmaceutical manufacturers according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee does not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.\n\u00b7\nSome states have elected to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. We expect any Medicaid expansion to impact the number of adults in Medicaid more than children because many states have already set their eligibility criteria for children at or above the level designated in the Affordable Care Act. An increase in the proportion of patients who receive our drugs and who are covered by Medicaid could adversely affect our net sales revenue.\nCMS issued final regulations that became effective on April 1, 2016 to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act.\nThere can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government healthcare or third-party reimbursement programs will not have a material adverse effect on us. Healthcare reform is also under consideration in other countries where we intend to market Qsymia. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and to alter the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and related laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nWe expect to experience pricing and reimbursement pressures in connection with the sale of Qsymia, STENDRA and our investigational drug candidates, if approved, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative and regulatory actions. In addition, we may confront limitations in insurance coverage for Qsymia, STENDRA and our investigational drug candidates. For example, the Medicare program generally does not provide coverage for drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction or drugs used to treat obesity. Similarly, other insurers may determine that such products are not covered under their programs. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates and our business will be harmed. Congress has enacted healthcare reform and may enact further reform, which could adversely affect the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBoth of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Qsymia, phentermine and topiramate, are available as single ingredient generic products and do not have a REMS requirement. The exact doses of the active ingredients in Qsymia are different than those currently available for the generic components. State pharmacy laws prohibit pharmacists from\nsubstituting drugs with differing doses and formulations. The safety and efficacy of Qsymia is dependent on the titration, dosing and formulation, which we believe could not be easily duplicated, if at all, with the use of generic substitutes. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to provide for optimal reimbursement of Qsymia as a treatment for obesity or, if approved, for any other indication, from third-party payors or the U.S. government. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that healthcare providers would not actively seek to provide patients with generic versions of the active ingredients in Qsymia in order to treat obesity at a potential lower cost and outside of the REMS requirements.\nAn increasing number of EU Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. In addition, the ongoing budgetary difficulties faced by a number of EU Member States, including Greece and Spain, have led and may continue to lead to substantial delays in payment and payment partially with government bonds rather than cash for medicinal products, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement of our medicinal products in some countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our medicinal products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country. For more information concerning pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the EU and, in particular, the impact of HTA, please refer to the section titled \u201cGovernment Regulation - Coverage and Reimbursement.\u201d\nSetbacks and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and our, or our collaborators\u2019, inability to obtain third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, could make partnering more difficult and diminish our revenues.\nSetbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, such as those caused by safety concerns relating to high-profile drugs like Avandia\u00ae, Vioxx\u00ae and Celebrex\u00ae, or investigational drug candidates, as well as competition from generic drugs, litigation, and industry consolidation, may have an adverse effect on us. For example, pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into new collaborations or continue existing collaborations if they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition or if their therapeutic areas of focus change following a merger. Moreover, our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize any of our approved drugs or future investigational drug candidates will depend in part on government regulation and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including private health insurers and government payors, such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, increases in government-run, single-payor health insurance plans and compulsory licenses of drugs. Government and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs. Given the continuing discussion regarding the cost of healthcare, managed care, universal healthcare coverage and other healthcare issues, we cannot predict with certainty what additional healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business. These efforts may limit our commercial opportunities by reducing the amount a potential collaborator is willing to pay to license our programs or investigational drug candidates in the future due to a reduction in the potential revenues from drug sales. Adoption of legislation and regulations could limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, drugs. A government or third-party payor decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our drugs could limit market acceptance of these drugs.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contract sales organization (\u201cCSO\u201d), CROs, safety monitoring company and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, accidents, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our investigational drug candidate development programs and drug manufacturing operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our investigational drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts with FDA, the EC, or the competent authorities of the EU Member States, and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, we could incur liability and the further development of our investigational drug candidates, or commercialization of our approved drugs, could be delayed. If we are unable to restore our information systems in the event of a systems failure, our communications, daily operations and the ability to develop our investigational drug candidates and approved drug commercialization efforts would be severely affected.\nNatural disasters or resource shortages could disrupt our investigational drug candidate development and approved drug commercialization efforts and adversely affect results.\nOur ongoing or planned clinical trials and approved drug commercialization efforts could be delayed or disrupted indefinitely upon the occurrence of a natural disaster. For example, Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, hindered our Qsymia sales efforts. In 2005, our clinical trials in the New Orleans area were interrupted by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, our offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are therefore vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. In October 1989, a major earthquake in our area caused significant property damage and a number of fatalities. We are also vulnerable to damage from other disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and similar events. If a significant disaster occurs, our ability to continue our operations could be seriously impaired and we may not have adequate insurance to cover any resulting losses. Any significant unrecoverable losses could seriously impair our operations and financial condition.\nBrexit may harm our ability to market our products, to do business, increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price.\nWorldwide economic conditions remain uncertain due to various developments including the decision by the United Kingdom to initiate the formal procedure of withdrawal from the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), current economic challenges in Asia and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets.\nBrexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. From a regulatory perspective, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU could give rise to significant complexity and risks. In addition, the exact terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and the laws and regulations that will apply after the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU may affect manufacturing sites that hold an EU manufacturing authorization issued by the United Kingdom competent authorities.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nObtaining intellectual property rights is a complex process, and we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary technologies.\nWe hold various patents and patent applications in the U.S. and abroad targeting obesity and morbidities related to obesity, including sleep apnea and diabetes, and sexual health, among other indications. The procedures for obtaining a patent in the U.S. and in most foreign countries are complex. These procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many sophisticated legal issues. Consequently, the process for having our pending patent applications issue as patents will be difficult, complex and time consuming. We do not know when, or if, we will obtain additional patents for our technologies, or if the scope of the patents obtained will be sufficient to protect our investigational drug candidates or products, or be considered sufficient by parties reviewing our patent positions pursuant to a potential licensing or financing transaction.\nIn addition, we cannot make assurances as to how much protection, if any, will be provided by our issued patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies or products. For example, we have limited patent coverage for PANCREAZE, which would not protect us should others develop alternative formulations of the drug.\nThese companies would then be able to develop, manufacture and sell products that compete directly with our products. In that case, our revenues and operating results could decline.\nOther entities may also challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and patent applications in litigation or administrative proceedings. The sponsor of a generic application seeking to rely on one of our approved drug products as the reference listed drug must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A \u201cParagraph III\u201d certification is the sponsor\u2019s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A \u201cParagraph IV\u201d certification is a challenge to the patent; it is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product. Once FDA accepts for filing a generic application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the reference listed drug (\u201cRLD\u201d) NDA holder and patent owner that the application with patent challenge has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant\u2019s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner file suit against the generic applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, FDA is prohibited from approving the generic application for a period of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice. If the RLD has new chemical entity exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. If a competitor or a generic pharmaceutical provider successfully challenges our patents, the protection provided by these patents could be reduced or eliminated and our ability to commercialize any approved drugs would be at risk. In addition, if a competitor or generic manufacturer were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow-on version of one of our products, our approved product would become subject to increased competition and our revenues for that product would be adversely affected.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets and other unpatented confidential information to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators, vendors (including CROs and our CSO), consultants and, at times, potential investors. Nevertheless, employees, collaborators, vendors, consultants or potential investors may still disclose or misuse our trade secrets and other confidential information, and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Disclosure or misuse of our confidential information would harm our competitive position and could cause our revenues and operating results to decline.\nIf we believe that others have infringed or misappropriated our proprietary rights, we may need to institute legal action to protect our intellectual property rights. Such legal action may be expensive, and we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights against others.\nWe may receive additional notices of ANDA filings submitted by generic drug companies asserting that generic forms of our approved therapies would not infringe on our issued patents. As a result of these potential filings, we may commence additional litigation to defend our patent rights, which would result in additional litigation costs and, depending on the outcome of the litigation, might result in competition from lower cost generic or follow-on products earlier than anticipated.\nQsymia is approved under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d) which renders it susceptible to potential competition from generic manufacturers via the ANDA approval process. The FDCA includes provisions allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the innovator\u2019s patent protection by submitting \u201cParagraph IV\u201d certifications to FDA in which the generic manufacturer claims that the innovator\u2019s patent is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the generic product. A patent owner who receives a Paragraph IV certification may choose to sue the generic applicant for patent infringement.\nWe received certain Paragraph IV certification notices and have entered into settlement agreements with those who have submitted those notices. The settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., Actavis, Inc., and Actavis PLC, collectively referred to as \u201cActavis,\u201d will permit Actavis to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on December 1, 2024, or earlier under certain circumstances. The settlement with Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, S.A. and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc., collectively referred to as \u201cDRL,\u201d will permit DRL to begin selling a generic version of\nQsymia on June 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. It is possible that one or more additional companies may file an ANDA and could receive FDA approval to market a generic version of Qsymia before the entry dates specified in our settlement agreements with Actavis and DRL, including if it is determined that the generic product does not infringe our patents, or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Although we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to Qsymia, in the event there is a future ANDA filer, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in a future defense of our patent rights. If a generic version of Qsymia or any of our other approved therapies is introduced, these therapies would become subject to increased competition and our revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in delays or termination of our future research, development, manufacturing and sales activities.\nOur commercial success also depends, in part, upon our ability to develop future investigational drug candidates, market and sell approved drugs and conduct our other research, development and commercialization activities without infringing or misappropriating the patents and other proprietary rights of others. There are many patents and patent applications owned by others that could be relevant to our business. For example, there are numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others that are related to the therapeutic areas in which we have approved drugs or future investigational drug candidates as well as the therapeutic targets to which these drugs and candidates are directed. There are also numerous issued patents and patent applications covering chemical compounds or synthetic processes that may be necessary or useful to use in our research, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our approved drugs, future investigational drug candidates or technologies may infringe. There also may be existing patents, of which we are not aware, that our approved drugs, investigational drug candidates or technologies may infringe. Further, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. We cannot assure you that others holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seek to enjoin our activities. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this.\nThere can be no assurance that approved drugs or future investigational drug candidates do not or will not infringe on the patents or proprietary rights of others. In addition, third parties may already own or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents.\nIf a person or entity files a legal action or administrative action against us, or our collaborators, claiming that our drug discovery, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities infringe a patent owned by the person or entity, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of the time and attention of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell any current or future approved drugs, and such claims could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. In that case, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative investigational drug candidates or be required to cease commercializing any affected current or future approved drugs and our operating results would be harmed.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of pre-trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may face additional competition outside of the U.S. as a result of a lack of patent coverage in some territories and differences in patent prosecution and enforcement laws in foreign countries.\nFiling, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents on all of our drug discovery technologies and all of our approved drugs and potential investigational drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. While we have filed patent applications in many countries outside the U.S., and have obtained some patent coverage for approved drugs in certain foreign countries, we do not currently have widespread patent protection for these drugs outside the U.S. and have no protection in many foreign jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own drugs in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection. These drugs may compete with our approved drugs or future investigational drug candidates and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights.\nEven if international patent applications ultimately issue or receive approval, it is likely that the scope of protection provided by such patents will be different from, and possibly less than, the scope provided by our corresponding U.S. patents. The success of our international market opportunity is dependent upon the enforcement of patent rights in various other countries. A number of countries in which we have filed or intend to file patent applications have a history of weak enforcement and/or compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Even if we have patents issued in these jurisdictions, there can be no assurance that our patent rights will be sufficient to prevent generic competition or unauthorized use.\nAttempting to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Relating to our Financial Position and Need for Financing\nWe may require additional capital for our future operating plans and debt servicing requirements, and we may not be able to secure the requisite additional funding on acceptable terms, or at all, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate commercialization or development efforts.\nWe expect that our existing capital resources combined with future anticipated cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating activities at least through the next twelve months. However, we anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional financing to fund our commercialization efforts, additional clinical studies for approved products, the development of our research and development pipeline and the servicing requirements of our debt. Our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to expand the use of Qsymia and PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with the integration of PANCREAZE operations;\n\u00b7\nthe costs to commercialize PANCREAZE;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain marketing authorization by the EC for Qsiva in the EU and other territories;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manage costs;\n\u00b7\nthe cost required to maintain the REMS program for Qsymia;\n\u00b7\nthe cost, timing and outcome of the post-approval clinical studies FDA has required us to perform as part of the approval for Qsymia;\n\u00b7\nour ability, along with our collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize STENDRA/SPEDRA;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully commercialize STENDRA/SPEDRA through a third party in other territories in which we do not currently have a commercial collaboration;\n\u00b7\nthe progress and costs of our research and development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with obtaining, developing and marketing any new development assets;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical, clinical and retrospective observational studies and trials;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of access to electronic records and databases that allow for retrospective observational studies;\n\u00b7\npatient recruitment and enrollment in future clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for future drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications, defending and enforcing patent claims;\n\u00b7\nthe establishment of collaborations, sublicenses and strategic alliances and the related costs, including milestone payments;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements;\n\u00b7\nthe level of resources devoted to our future sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe cost, timing and outcome of litigation, if any;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of healthcare reform, if any, imposed by the federal government; and\n\u00b7\nthe activities of competitors.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional businesses, products and technologies. On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. We paid Selten an upfront payment of $1.0 million, and we will pay additional milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds. The total potential milestone payments are $39.6 million.\nTo obtain additional capital when needed, we will evaluate alternative financing sources, including, but not limited to, the issuance of equity or debt securities, corporate alliances, joint ventures and licensing agreements. However, there can be no assurance that funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. We are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest, sell or spin-off one or more of our drugs and/or investigational drug candidates at any time. We cannot assure you that our drugs will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, management may be required to explore alternatives to reduce cash used by operating activities, including the termination of research and development efforts that may appear to be promising to us, the sale of certain assets and the reduction in overall operating activities. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities will cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. We have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations, primarily by issuing equity and debt securities. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. To raise additional capital, we may choose to issue additional securities at any time and at any price.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have $181.4 million in 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2020, which we refer to as the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible into approximately 1,683,000 shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 6.73038 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $148.58 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. On October 8, 2015, IEH Biopharma LLC, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises L.P., announced that it had received tenders for $170,165,000 of the aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes in\nits previously announced cash tender offer for any and all of the outstanding Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holders under certain conditions at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 1, 2019. Investors in our common stock will be diluted to the extent the Convertible Notes are converted into shares of our common stock, rather than being settled in cash.\nIn April 2018, we entered into an agreement for a new $120.0 million senior secured note (the \u201cAthyrium Notes\u201d) with Athyrium Capital Management, LP (\u201cAthyrium\u201d). $110.0 million of the Athyrium Notes were drawn down in June 2018, with the remaining $10.0 million available for drawing upon meeting certain conditions. Payments on the Athyrium Notes bear interest at 10.375% and are interest-only for the first 36 months; thereafter the notes will be repaid in 36 equal monthly payments. Concurrently, we repurchased Convertible Notes held by Athyrium, with a face value of $60.0 million, for $51.0 million. In October 2018, we settled a purchase of approximately $8.6 million outstanding principal amount of our Convertible Notes for approximately $7.1 million plus accrued interest. We continue our evaluation of alternatives for addressing our remaining $181.4 million of Convertible Notes.\nWe may also raise additional capital through the incurrence of debt, and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to our stockholders\u2019 rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nIn addition, debt financing typically contains covenants that restrict operating activities. For example, on March 25, 2013, we entered into the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \u201cBioPharma Agreement\u201d) with BioPharma Secured Investments III Holdings Cayman LP (\u201cBioPharma\u201d) which provides for the purchase of a debt-like instrument. Under the BioPharma Agreement, we may not (i) incur indebtedness greater than a specified amount, (ii) pay a dividend or other cash distribution on our capital stock, unless we have cash and cash equivalents in excess of a specified amount, (iii) amend or restate our certificate of incorporation or bylaws unless such amendments or restatements do not affect BioPharma\u2019s interests under the BioPharma Agreement, (iv) encumber the collateral, or (v) abandon certain patent rights, in each case without the consent of BioPharma. Any future debt financing we enter into may involve similar or more onerous covenants that restrict our operations.\nIf we raise additional capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our drugs or future investigational drug candidates, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate the commercialization of one or more of our approved drugs or the development of one or more of our future investigational drug candidates.\nThe investment of our cash balance and our available-for-sale securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $111.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. While at December 31, 2018, our excess cash balances were invested in money market, U.S. Treasury securities and corporate debt securities, our investment policy as approved by our Board of Directors, also provides for investments in debt securities of U.S. government agencies, corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities. Our investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal. However, there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy. These factors could impact the liquidity or valuation of our available-for-sale securities, all of which were invested in U.S. Treasury securities or corporate debt securities as of December 31, 2018. If those securities are downgraded or impaired we would experience losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. An investment in money market mutual funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although money market mutual funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in money market mutual funds.\nOur involvement in securities-related class action and shareholder litigation could divert our resources and management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities-related class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their investigational drug candidate development programs, the review of marketing applications by regulatory authorities and the commercial launch of newly approved drugs. We were a defendant in federal and consolidated state shareholder derivative lawsuits. These securities-related class action lawsuits generally alleged that we and our officers misled the investing public regarding the safety and efficacy of Qsymia and the prospects for FDA\u2019s approval of the Qsymia NDA as a treatment for obesity. Securities-related class action litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and our financial resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nFor example, on March 27, 2014, Mary Jane and Thomas Jasin, who purport to be purchasers of VIVUS common stock, filed an Amended Complaint in Santa Clara County Superior Court alleging securities fraud against us and three of our former officers and directors. In that complaint, captioned Jasin v. VIVUS, Inc., Case No. 114 cv 261427, plaintiffs asserted claims under California\u2019s securities and consumer protection securities statutes. Plaintiffs alleged generally that defendants misrepresented the prospects for our success, including with respect to the launch of Qsymia, while purportedly selling VIVUS stock for personal profit. Plaintiffs alleged losses of \u201cat least\u201d $2.8 million, and sought damages and other relief. On July 18, 2014, the same plaintiffs filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Jasin v. VIVUS, Inc., Case No. 5:14 cv 03263. The Jasins\u2019 federal complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on facts substantially similar to those alleged in their state court action. On September 15, 2014, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their state court action with prejudice. Defendants moved to dismiss the federal action and moved to dismiss again after plaintiffs amended their complaint to include additional factual allegations and to add seven new claims under California law. The court granted the latter motion on June 18, 2015, dismissing the seven California claims with prejudice and dismissing the two federal claims with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on August 17, 2015. Defendants moved to dismiss that complaint as well. On April 19, 2016, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on May 18, 2016. The Ninth Circuit issued a decision on January 16, 2018, affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action. The deadline for Plaintiffs to seek rehearing in the Ninth Circuit and to file a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court has now expired and the matter is concluded.\nWe have an accumulated deficit of $880.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and we may continue to incur substantial operating losses for the future.\nWe have generated a cumulative net loss of $880.5 million for the period from our inception through December 31, 2018, and we anticipate losses in future years due to continued investment in our research and development programs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability or that we will be successful in the future.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $630.7 million and $273.6 million of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards with which to offset our future taxable income for federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respectively. Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, or tax attributes, may be subject to substantial annual limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions to the extent certain ownership changes are deemed to occur. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the tax attributes before utilization. The tax attributes reflected above have not been reduced by any limitations. To the extent it is determined upon completion of the analysis that such limitations do apply, we will adjust the tax attributes accordingly.\nWe face the risk that our ability to use our tax attributes will be substantially restricted if we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d). An ownership change under Section 382 would occur if \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d within the meaning of Section 382, collectively increased their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. We have not completed a recent study to assess whether any change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation, due to the significant complexity and cost associated with the study. We have completed studies through December 31, 2016 and concluded no adjustments were required. If we have experienced a change of control at any time since our formation, our NOL carryforwards and tax credits may not be available, or their utilization could be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. A full valuation allowance has been provided against our NOL carryforwards, and if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. Accordingly, there would be no impact on the consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities that could negatively impact our income tax provision, net income, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be so. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate due to factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet the expectations of investors related to the commercialization of Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA;\n\u00b7\nour ability to find the right partner for expanded Qsymia commercial promotion to a broader primary care physician audience;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain marketing authorization for our products in foreign jurisdictions, including authorization from the EC for Qsiva in the EU;\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and outcome of post-approval clinical studies which FDA has required us to perform as part of the approval for Qsymia and STENDRA;\n\u00b7\nthe cost required to maintain the REMS program for Qsymia;\n\u00b7\nresults within the clinical trial programs for Qsymia and STENDRA or other results or decisions affecting the development of our investigational drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\napproval of, or announcements of, other anti-obesity compounds in development;\n\u00b7\npublication of generic drug combination weight loss data by outside individuals or companies;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain needed financing;\n\u00b7\nsales by insiders or major stockholders;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u00b7\nthe volatility and liquidity of the financial markets;\n\u00b7\ncomments by or changes in assessments of us or financial estimates by security analysts;\n\u00b7\nnegative reports by the media or industry analysts on various aspects of our products, our performance and our future operations;\n\u00b7\nthe status of the CVOT and our related discussions with FDA;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory actions or decisions;\n\u00b7\nany loss of key management;\n\u00b7\ndeviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments;\n\u00b7\ndiscussions about us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities;\n\u00b7\ntrading activity by highly technical investors utilizing sophisticated algorithms and high frequency trading;\n\u00b7\ninvestment activities employed by short sellers of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nreports of prescription data by us or from independent third parties for our products;\n\u00b7\nlicensing, product, patent or securities litigation; and\n\u00b7\npublic concern as to the safety or efficacy of our drugs or future investigational drug candidates developed by us.\nThese factors and fluctuations, as well as political and other market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain or recruit key employees, all of whom have been or will be granted equity awards as an important part of their compensation packages.\nOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate. If our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline.\nOur operating results will likely fluctuate from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter, and from year to year, and are difficult to predict. Product sales of Qsymia may never increase or become profitable. We may be unsuccessful in properly integrating and profitably marketing PANCREAZE. In addition, although we have entered into license and commercialization agreements with Menarini to commercialize and promote SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 countries, including the EU, plus Australia and New Zealand and with Metuchen to commercialize STENDRA in the U.S., Canada, South America and India, we and they may not be successful in commercializing avanafil in these territories. Our operating expenses are largely independent of sales in any particular period. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be negatively affected by a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the level of patient demand for Qsymia and STENDRA, the ability of our distribution partners to process and ship product on a timely basis, the success of our third-party\u2019s manufacturing efforts to meet customer demand, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, investments in sales and marketing efforts to support the sales of Qsymia and STENDRA, investments in the research and development efforts, and expenditures we may incur to acquire additional products.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of our stock by our executive officers or directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. We have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our employee benefits plans. As a result, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. Any of our executive officers or directors may adopt trading plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1 to dispose of a portion of their stock. If any of these events cause a large number of our shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company difficult, even if an acquisition may benefit our stockholders.\nOn November 8, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted an amendment and restatement of our Preferred Stock Rights Plan, which was originally adopted on March 26, 2007. As amended and restated, the Preferred Stock Rights Plan is designed to protect stockholder value by mitigating the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that would result in significant limitations to our ability to use our NOLs or other tax attributes to offset future income. As amended and restated, the Preferred Stock Rights Plan will continue in effect until November 9, 2019, unless earlier terminated or the rights are earlier exchanged or redeemed by our Board of Directors. We submitted the plan to a vote at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, and stockholders ratified the plan at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. The Preferred Stock Rights Plan has the effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires more than 4.9% of our shares without the approval of our Board of Directors. The existence of the Preferred Stock Rights Plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nSome provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. Some of these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock by the Board without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nspecify procedures for director nominations by stockholders and submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\neliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These and other provisions in our charter documents could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 80485, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "VVUSQ"}
