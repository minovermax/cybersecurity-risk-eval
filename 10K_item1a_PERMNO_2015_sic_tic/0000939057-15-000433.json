{"cik": "1448301", "company": "Anchor Bancorp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to Anchor Bancorp, our industry, and our market area. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe current weak economic conditions in the market areas we serve may continue to adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio.\nSubstantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the state of Washington. A decline in the economies of the five counties in which we operate, which we consider to be our primary market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Weak economic conditions and previous strains in the financial and housing markets in our market area has resulted in higher levels of loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the values of the collateral securing our loans.\nContinued weakness or a further deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nthe slowing of sales of foreclosed assets;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline, possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans or assets;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans made may decline further in value, exposing us to increased risk of loss on existing loans, reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease and the composition of our deposits may be adversely affected.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession that officially ended in June, 2009; however, economic growth has been slow and uneven, unemployment remains relatively high and concerns still exist over the federal deficit, government spending and global geopolitical risks which have all contributed to diminished expectations for the economy in our market areas. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. If the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated in loans with a higher risk of loss.\nIn addition to residential mortgage loans, we originate construction and land loans, commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, commercial business loans, and consumer loans primarily within our market areas. At June 30, 2015, we had $230.3 million outstanding in non-residential loans. At that date, loans delinquent 30 days or more, including nonperforming loans, were $3.6 million, and delinquent loans represented 1.3% of total loans. Many of these loans are perceived to have greater credit risk than residential real estate loans for a number of reasons, including those described below:\nCommercial and Multi-family Mortgage Loans. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Commercial and multi-family mortgage loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. At June 30, 2015, we had $171.6 million or 59.5% of total loans in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, none of which were nonperforming.\nConstruction and Land Loans. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, we originated $12.8 million and $21.3 million in construction loans, but only a very limited number of land loans. From June 30, 2012 through June 30, 2015, our construction loans grew 175.2%, while our land loans declined by 42.4%. At June 30, 2015, we had $15.8 million or 5.5% of total loans in construction and land loans of which $4.1 million were land loans. There were no land acquisition and development loans outstanding at June 30, 2015.\nConstruction and land lending includes the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property's value at completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. In addition, during the term of a construction loan, no payment from the borrower typically is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted at, or prior to, the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment and may incur a loss. In addition, speculative construction loans to a builder are for homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences.\nLoans on land under development or held for future construction as well as lot loans made to individuals for the future construction of a residence also pose additional risk because the length of time from financing to completion of a development project is significantly longer than for a traditional construction loan, which makes them more susceptible to declines in real estate values, declines in overall economic conditions which may delay the development of the land and changes in the political landscape that could affect the permitted and intended use of the land being financed, and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. In addition, during this long period of time from financing to completion, the collateral often does not generate any cash flow to support the debt service.\nAs a result, construction and land lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or to obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest. At June 30, 2015, $2.1 million of our construction loans were to builders for speculative residential construction. Speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of origination. At June 30, 2015, none of our construction and land loans were nonperforming.\nCommercial Business Loans. At June 30, 2015, we had $19.0 million or 6.6% of total loans in commercial business loans, however, we are currently planning on expanding our commercial business lending, subject to market conditions. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The borrower's cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible, inventories may be obsolete or of limited use, and other collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and creditworthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. At June 30, 2015, nonperforming commercial business loans totaled $711,000.\nConsumer Loans. We make secured and unsecured consumer loans. Our secured consumer loans are collateralized with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. At June 30, 2015, we had $23.9 million or 8.3% of total loans in consumer loans of which $31,000 were nonperforming. Of this amount, $17.6 million were in home equity loans, some of which are loans in amounts for up to 100% of collateral value. For more information about the credit risk, we face with respect to these types of loans, see \u201cOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\u201d\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt June 30, 2015, $57.9 million, or 20.1%, of our total loan portfolio, was secured by one-to-four single-family real property. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers\nto meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the Washington housing markets in which we operate may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these loans and increase our risk of loss if borrowers default on their loans. Recessionary conditions or declines in the volume of real estate sales and/or the sales prices couples with elevated unemployment rates may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial condition and business operations. These declines may also have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose loan portfolios are more diversified.\nMany of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated the loan with a relatively high combined loan-to-value ratio or because of the decline in home values in our market areas. Residential loans with combined higher loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. Further, a significant amount of our home equity lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our residential loans.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk as the result of subprime loans.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we held in our loan portfolio $5.3 million in one-to-four family mortgage loans ($2.7 million of which were fixed rate), $1.9 million of home equity loans (of which $1.3 million were fixed rate) and $162,000 of other types of consumer loans (of which were fixed rate), which are considered \u201csubprime\u201d by federal banking regulators. The aggregate amount of loans considered subprime at June 30, 2015 was $7.4 million or 2.6% of our total loan portfolio. In exchange for the additional lender risk associated with these loans, these borrowers generally are required to pay a higher interest rate, and depending on the severity of the credit history, a lower loan-to-value ratio may be required than for a conforming loan borrower. At the time of loan origination, our subprime borrowers had an average Fair Isaac and Company, Incorporated, or FICO, credit score of 628 and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 62%, which loan-to-value ratio may be significantly understated if current market values are used. A FICO score is a principal measure of credit quality and is one of the significant criteria we rely upon in our underwriting. Generally, a FICO score higher than 660 indicates the borrower has an acceptable credit reputation. At June 30, 2015, $668,000 or 9.0% of our subprime loans were categorized as nonperforming assets. Subprime loans are generally considered to have an increased risk of delinquency and foreclosure than do conforming loans, especially when adjustable rate loans adjust to a higher interest rate. We had not experienced such increased delinquencies or foreclosures at June 30, 2015, however, our subprime loan portfolio will be adversely affected in the event of a further downturn in regional or national economic conditions. In addition, we may not recover funds in an amount equal to any remaining loan balance. Consequently, we could sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher provision for loan loss expense.\nOur concentration in non-owner occupied residential real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt June 30, 2015, $15.2 million, or 27.2% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio and 5.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depends primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. At June 30, 2015, we had nine non-owner occupied residential loan relationships, with aggregate outstanding balances of $7.8 million, of which two loan relationships had an aggregate outstanding balance over $500,000. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner occupied residential mortgage loan. At June 30, 2015, all of our non-owner occupied residential mortgage loans complied with their loan repayment terms, except for one loan which totaled $172,000 at that date.\nWe have a concentration of large loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers that increases our risk of loss.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, largely in connection with our commercial real estate, non-owner occupied residential real estate loans and construction loans. At June 30, 2015, the aggregate amount of loans\nto our ten largest borrowers amounted to approximately $68.4 million or 23.7% of total loans. At this date, none of the loans to our ten largest borrowers were nonperforming.\nA high concentration of credit to a limited number of borrowers increases the risk of our loan portfolio. In the event that one or more of these borrowers is not able to meet interest payments or pay scheduled amortization on such obligations, the potential loss to us is more likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. Our total of income producing or non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans were $126.8 million or 211.7% of total capital at June 30, 2015 compared to $124.3million or 216.9% of total capital at June 30, 2014. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms, or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022\nthe changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nthe character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which we believe is an appropriate reserve to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is funded by provisions for loan losses charged to expense. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience, certain macroeconomic factors, and management's expectations of future events;\n\u2022\nour specific reserve, based on our evaluation of nonperforming loans and their underlying collateral; and\n\u2022\nan allocated pool reserve to provide for other credit losses including allocations for secured and unsecured loans.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of\nmanagement. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses we will need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Any additional provisions will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nAt June 30, 2015, our nonperforming assets which consist of nonaccruing loans and real estate owned, were $2.8 million, or 0.7% of total assets. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u2022\nwe record interest income only on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans and any nonperforming securities and we do not record interest income for real estate owned;\n\u2022\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u2022\nnoninterest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other-than-temporary impairment on nonperforming securities;\n\u2022\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to our real estate owned; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed upon and the property taken in as real estate owned and at certain other times during the asset's holding period. Our net book value (\u201cNBV\u201d) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (\u201cfair value\u201d). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset's NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, the fair value of the investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our NBV in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. Additional material charge-offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our real estate owned and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs, as required by the bank regulators, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nFluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference, or spread, between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning\nassets and funding liabilities. In a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage this risk effectively. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate and/or sell loans; (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, which could negatively impact shareholders' equity, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; and (5) the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. As a result of the relatively low interest rate environment, an increasing percentage of our deposits have been comprised of short-term certificates of deposit and other deposits yielding no or a relatively low rate of interest. At June 30, 2015, we had $40.4 million in certificates of deposit that mature within one year and $44.7 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, a substantial amount of our mortgage loans and home equity loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment. Further, a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates, such as we are currently experiencing, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of substantially reduced asset yields.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates, such as we are currently experiencing, limits our ability to lower our interest expense, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease as our loans reprice or are originated at these low market rates. Accordingly, our net interest income may continue to decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet.\nFurther decreases in noninterest income could adversely affect our ability to remain profitable and, if we cannot generate and increase our income, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur net interest income has decreased steadily in recent years. We also face significant challenges that will hinder our ability to generate competitive returns. Our most significant challenge has been our low interest rate spread and margin during recent periods. As a result, we have become even more reliant on our noninterest income, including from time to time significant gains on sales of investments in order to increase noninterest income. These gains on sales of investments are subject to market and other risks and cannot be relied upon. During the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, net interest income before provision for loan losses was less than noninterest expense by $3.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively. While we have identified various strategic initiatives that we will pursue in our efforts to overcome these challenges and improve earnings, our strategic initiatives may not succeed in generating and increasing income. If we are unable to generate or increase income, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we originate and sell residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates affect demand for our residential loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans. A decrease in the volume of loans sold can decrease our revenues and net income. Further, recent regulatory changes to the rules for overdraft fees for debit transactions and interchange fees have reduced our fee income, resulting in a reduction of our noninterest income.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, and growth prospects.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We rely on customer deposits and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\u201cFHLB\u201d) and other borrowings to fund our operations. At June 30, 2015, we had $10.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding with an additional $122.3 million of available borrowing capacity. Additionally we have $5.0 million available with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank and $1.0 million available with the Federal Reserve. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB, or market conditions change. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the Washington or Oregon markets where our loans are concentrated, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired\nby factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nOur financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Although we consider our sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on reasonable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable, or are not available on reasonable terms, our financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects could be materially adversely affected. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Recently several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point, we may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by the FDIC and DFI, we may be subject to additional adverse regulatory action. See \u201c- We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and are subject to certain business limitations. Further, we may be subject to more severe future regulatory enforcement actions if our financial condition or performance weakens further.\u201d above.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.", "PERMNO": 12498, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ANCB"}
