{"cik": "8504", "company": "AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors discussed below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Although we have attempted to list comprehensively these important factors, we caution you that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nThe risks described below set forth what we believe to be the most material risks associated with the purchase of our Common Stock. Before you invest in our Common Stock, you should carefully consider these risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this prospectus.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve\nWe operate in evolving markets, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nAgEagle\u2019s drone, sensor and software technologies are and will be sold in new and rapidly evolving markets. The commercial UAV industry is in the early stages of customer adoption and the FAA\u2019s definition of regulations relating to the integration of commercial drones into the U.S. airspace is still ill-defined but advancing. Accordingly, our business and future prospects may be difficult to evaluate. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for our drone systems and solutions will increase, if at all. The challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets could impact our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf Generate sufficient revenue to achieve sustainable profitability;\n\u25cf Acquire and maintain market share;\n\u25cf Achieve or manage growth in our business operations;\n\u25cf Renew contracts;\n\u25cf Attract and retain software and system engineers and other highly qualified personnel;\n\u25cf Successfully develop and commercial market new products and end-to-end solutions;\n\u25cf Adapt to new or changing polices and spending priorities of prospective clients; and\n\u25cf Access additional capital when required and on reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating expenses.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, AgEagle Aerial, Inc., we have been operating for over ten years, but it not until recently that we have acquired the latest go-to-market airframes, sensors and software technologies. We are currently still in the business development stage of our products and commercial sales, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Moreover, even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industries in which we operate, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability and failure to do so would adversely affect its business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product and software development. We will require additional funds to support our continued research and development activities, as well as the costs of commercializing, marketing and selling any new products and/or services resulting from those activities.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate sufficient revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance future cash needs through equity or debt financings or corporate collaborations and/or strategic arrangements. On May 25, 2021, the Company entered into an at-the-market Sales Agreement (the \"ATM Sales Agreement\") with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. as sales agents (the \"Agents\"), in connection with the offer and sale from time to time of up to $100,000,000 of shares of the Company's Common Stock (the \"ATM Shares\"), through an at-the-market equity offering program (the \"ATM Offering\"). If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may have to delay, curtail or eliminate commercializing, marketing and selling one or more of our solutions. During the period from May 26, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the Company sold 5,705,877 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.001, at a stock price between $5.00 and $6.30 per share, for proceeds of $30,868,703, net of issuance costs of $954,707.\nProduct development is a long, expensive and uncertain process.\nThe development of both UAV software and hardware is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and investments in product development often involve a long wait until a return, if any, can be achieved on such investment. We might face difficulties or delays in the development process that will result in our inability to timely offer products that satisfy the market, which might allow competing products to emerge during the development and certification process. We anticipate making significant investments in research and development relating to our products and technology services, but such investments are inherently speculative and require substantial capital expenditures. Any unforeseen technical obstacles and challenges that we encounter in the research and development process could result in delays in or the abandonment of product commercialization, may substantially increase development costs, and may negatively affect our results of operations.\nSuccessful technical development of our products does not guarantee successful commercialization.\nAlthough we have successfully acquired our fully-developed go-to-market UAV systems sensor and software technology solutions which we offer for sale or subscription, we may still fail to achieve commercial success for several reasons, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals for their use;\n\u25cf rapid obsolescence of a product due to new, more advanced technologies;\n\u25cf prohibitive production costs;\n\u25cf competing products;\n\u25cf lack of product innovation;\n\u25cf unsuccessful distribution and marketing through our sales channels;\n\u25cf insufficient cooperation from our supply and distribution partners; and\n\u25cf product development that does not align with or meet customer needs.\nOur success in the market for the products and services we develop will depend largely on our ability to properly demonstrate their capabilities. Upon demonstration, our solutions may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or that we believed they would have. Furthermore, even if we do successfully demonstrate our products\u2019 capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business with our competitor; or may not feel there is a significant need for the products we develop. As a result, significant revenue from our current and new product investments may not be achieved for several years, if at all that will result in profitability to the Company.\nWe face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources.\nOur competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications, past contract performance, geographic presence, price and the availability of key professional personnel. Furthermore, many of our competitors may be able to utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale to develop competing products and technologies, manufacture in high volumes more efficiently, divert sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire away our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. Small business competitors may be able to offer more cost competitive solutions, due to their lower overhead costs. The markets for commercial drones and services are quickly expanding, and competition is intensifying as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product offerings. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing with larger, better financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. Our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or future operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and successful in the development of our products and to our future growth potential. Patent protection can be limited and not all intellectual property can be patented. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and procedures, non-competition agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, other proprietary rights and our brand. We currently only have a limited amount of granted patent or copyright protections, we must rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, which provide limited protections. As a result, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees or competitors.\nFurthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies and products, which could result in decreased revenues. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our brand and other intangible assets.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and harm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe that our technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of any third party; however, claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common and third parties may assert infringement claims against us. It may be difficult or impossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual property rights of a third party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are required to obtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any profit on our products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to its ability to generate revenue or enter into new market opportunities. If any of our products were found to infringe other parties\u2019 proprietary rights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our products to make them non-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nThe nature of our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance or indemnification.\nWe have developed and sold products and services in circumstances where insurance or indemnification may not be available, for example, in connection with the collection and analysis of various types of information. In addition, our products and services raise questions with respect to issues of civil liberties, intellectual property, trespass, conversion and similar concepts, which may create legal issues. Indemnification to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the failure of any technologies that we develop or deploy may be available in certain circumstances but not in others. Currently, the unmanned aerial systems industry lacks a formative insurance market. We may not be able to maintain insurance to protect against all operational risks and uncertainties that our customers confront. Substantial claims resulting from an accident, product failure, or personal injury or property liability arising from our products and services in excess of any indemnity or insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance coverage is not available or is not obtained) could harm our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. Any accident, even if fully covered or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.\nWe may incur substantial product liability claims relating to our products.\nAs a manufacturer of UAV products, and with aircraft and aviation sector companies under increased scrutiny, claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our UAV products causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In addition, defects in our products may lead to other potential life, health and property risks. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance and reputation as a contractor and our ability to obtain future business could suffer.\nWe often rely upon other companies to perform work we are obligated to perform for our customers. As we secure more work under certain of our contracts, we expect to require an increasing level of support from subcontractors that provide complementary or supplementary services to our offers. We are responsible for the work performed by our subcontractors, even though in some cases we have limited involvement in that work. If one or more of our subcontractors fails to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis or violates contracting policies, laws or regulations, our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor or meet our customers\u2019 requirements may be compromised. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability, including liability for the costs of re-procurement, could damage our reputation and could hurt our ability to compete for future contracts.\nFor certain of the components included in our products, there are a limited number of suppliers we can rely upon. If we are unable to obtain these components when needed, we could experience delays in the manufacturing of our products and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe acquire most of the components for the manufacture of our products from suppliers. Suppliers of some of the components may require us to place orders with significant lead-times to assure supply in accordance with its manufacturing requirements and enter into agreements specifically for our technological services business. Delays in supply may significantly hurt our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations and may significantly hurt our business and result of operations. In addition, we may not be able to continue to obtain such components from these suppliers on satisfactory commercial terms. Disruptions of its manufacturing operations would ensue if we were required to obtain components from alternative sources, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key management, technical and sales personnel, our business would be negatively affected.\nFor our business to be successful, we need to attract and retain highly qualified executive, technical and sales personnel. The failure to recruit additional key personnel when needed, with specific qualifications, on acceptable terms and with an ability to maintain positive relationships with our partners, might impede our ability to continue to develop, commercialize and sell our products and services. To the extent the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting and training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. The loss of any members of our management team may also delay or impair achievement of our business objectives and result in business disruptions due to the time needed for their replacements to be recruited and become familiar with our business. We face competition for qualified personnel from other companies with significantly more resources available to them and thus may not be able to attract the level of personnel needed for our business to succeed.\nIf our proposed marketing efforts are unsuccessful, we may not earn enough revenue to become profitable.\nOur future growth depends on our gaining market acceptance and regular production orders for our products and services. Our marketing plan includes attendance at trade shows, conducting private demonstrations, advertising, public relations, promotional materials and advertising campaigns in print and/or broadcast media. In addition, our marketing plan incorporates strategies to nurture, expand and leverage our global reseller network and relationships with government and defense contractors to achieve greater market penetration in the commercial and government/military verticals. In the event we are not successful in obtaining a significant volume of orders for our products and technology services, we will face significant obstacles in expanding our business. We cannot give any assurance that our marketing efforts will be successful. If they are not, revenue may not be sufficient to cover our fixed costs and we may not become profitable.\nOur operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or an increase in the cost of products sold.\nExpectations regarding future sales and expenses are largely fixed in the short term. We maintain raw materials and finished goods at a volume we feel is necessary for anticipated distribution and sales. Therefore, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls between forecasted and actual sales.\nWe face a significant risk of failure because we cannot accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results.\nThe rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete makes it difficult to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results. Furthermore, we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the timing of sales or subscription of our products;\n\u25cf unexpected delays in introducing new products and services;\n\u25cf increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing or administration; and\n\u25cf costs related to possible acquisitions of businesses.\nRapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which we compete are subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, change in customer demands and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and new technologies and by developing and introducing enhancements to our current products and services and new products and services. We may not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our products that will respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. In addition, we may experience difficulties internally or in conjunction with key vendors and partners that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of such enhancements and such enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the market and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of our new products or enhancements are delayed or, if when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put on the use of small UAS in response to public privacy concerns, may prevent us from expanding the sales of our drone solutions to commercial and industrial customers in the United States.\nThe regulation of small UAS for commercial use in the United States is undergoing substantial change and the ultimate treatment is uncertain. On February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was enacted, establishing various deadlines for the FAA to allow expanded use of small UAS for both public and commercial applications. On June 21, 2016, the FAA released its final rules regarding the routine use of certain small UAS (under 55 pounds) in the U.S. National Airspace System pursuant to the act (the \u201cPart 107 Rules\u201d). The Part 107 Rules, which became effective in August 2016, provided safety regulations for small UAS conducting non-recreational operations and contain various limitations and restrictions for such operations, including a requirement that operators keep UAS within visual-line-of-sight and prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly participating in the operation of the UAS. On December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules requiring remote identification of drones and allowing operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. We cannot assure you that any final rules enacted in furtherance of the FAA\u2019s announced proposals will result in the expanded use of our drones and drone solutions by commercial and industrial entities. In addition, there exists public concern regarding the privacy implications of U.S. commercial use of small UAS. This concern has included calls to develop explicit written policies and procedures establishing usage limitations. We cannot assure you that the response from regulatory agencies, customers and privacy advocates to these concerns will not delay or restrict the adoption of small UAS by the commercial use markets.\nOn March 10, 2022, the FAA\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee (\u201cARC\u201d) issued its final report to the FAA. In terms of key recommendations, the ARC recommends that the FAA set an acceptable level of risk (ALR) for UAS that is consistent across all types of operations being performed. The ARC envisions that this approach will allow the FAA to adopt a common and consistent set of regulations and guidance, giving operators the flexibility to meet the ALR through qualitative or quantitative methods, or a hybrid approach. Next, the ARC recommends a series of modifications to the right of way rules in Low Altitude Shielded Areas (within 100\u2019 of a structure or critical infrastructure as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5195c)2 and in Low Altitude Non-Shielded Areas (below 400\u2019) to accommodate uncrewed aircraft (\u201cUA\u201d) operations. Specifically, the ARC recommends several amendments to Right of Way rules to:\n\u25cf allow automatic means for see-and-avoid responsibility;\n\u25cf give UA right of way in Shielded Areas;\n\u25cf give UA right of way over crewed aircraft that are not equipped with ADS-B or TABS in Non-Shielded Low Altitude Areas; and\n\u25cf give crewed aircraft that are equipped with ADS-B or TABS (and broadcasting their position) right of way in Non-Shielded Low Altitude Areas.\nThe ARC also recommends an approach to operator qualification that would extend Part 107, Remote Pilot Certificate with Small UAS Rating, to cover topics associated with Extended Visual Line of Sight (EVLOS) and shielded UAS operations. The recommendation creates a new Remote Pilot certificate rating to cover BVLOS operations beyond the scope of the extended Part 107 rating. The examination for both ratings would consist of a knowledge test on relevant areas, while practical training and qualifications would be tied to new Remote Air Carrier and Remote Operating certificates, which would be required for most commercial 1-to-many operations. The qualifications would be based on specific UA systems, Use Cases, and operational restrictions.\nIn addition, the ARC recommends that the FAA establish a new BVLOS Rule which includes a process for qualification of UA and UAS, applicable to aircraft up to 800,000 ft-lb of kinetic energy (in accordance with the Operation Risk Matrix).\nFinally, the ARC recommends that the FAA adopt a non-mandatory regulatory scheme for third party services to be used in support of UAS BVLOS operations. In addition to its recommendations, the ARC identified certain issues relevant to UAS BVLOS operations that are beyond this ARC\u2019s scope, but which are identified in this report as considerations for future ARCs to address. Similarly, the ARC also identified several issues that are beyond the FAA\u2019s scope of authority. However, these recommendations are in the interest of providing a full framework of actions and policies to promote safe and widespread adoption of UAS BVLOS activities.\nFederal, state and tribal government regulation of domestic hemp cultivation is new and subject to constant change and evolution, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny changes in laws or regulations relating to domestic hemp cultivation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our business prospects for our HempOverview SaaS platform.\nWe may pursue additional strategic transactions in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nWe intend to consider additional potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current or future business. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. Should our relationships fail to materialize into significant agreements, or should we fail to work efficiently with these companies, we may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThese activities, if successful, create risks such as, among others: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity securities; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and (c) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of our existing shareholders or result in the issuance of, or assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources. Any such activities may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may negatively affect our operating results.\nAdditionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may not result in their anticipated benefits and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations or successfully combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions.\nBreaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks or other breaches of technology platforms or IT security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our systems and operations. We may be subject to attempts to breach the security of our technology platforms and IT infrastructure through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses and other means of unauthorized access. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our facilities as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses or loss of market share to other competitors in the defense electronics market. In addition, a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of technology platforms or IT security could result in damage to our reputation. To date, we have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments, and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as disasters occurring at our manufacturing facilities, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability to operate. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions. Disasters occurring at our manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers\u2019 perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nFor instance, Russia\u2019s recent military interventions in Ukraine have led to, and may lead to, additional sanctions being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia. Russia\u2019s military incursion and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect global energy and financial markets. Although our business does not have any direct exposure to Russia or the adjoining geographic regions, the extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions caused by Russian military action or resulting sanctions may magnify the impact of other risks described in this section. We cannot predict the progress or outcome of the situation in Ukraine, as the conflict and governmental reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, intensified military activities, or more extensive sanctions impacting the region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy, and such effect could in turn have a material adverse effect on the operations, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business outlook of our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the world, including the United States. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought on by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruptions of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, as a result of the pandemic, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture our proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been impacted. If either we or any third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and assemble products.\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nWorldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, including an economic decline in the agricultural industry, may adversely affect our operating performance.\nWe intend to distribute our products and services in a number of countries and derive revenues from both inside and outside the United States. We expect our business will be subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, in specific countries or regions, or in the agricultural industry; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters affecting our operations or our customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including an economic decline in the agricultural industry, could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur senior management and key employees are important to our customer relationships and overall business.\nWe believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our senior management and key employees. We rely heavily on our executive officers, senior management and key employees to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that members of our management team and key employees have established and maintain with certain key customers continue to our ability to maintain good customer relations and to identify new business opportunities. The loss of any of our executive officers, members of our senior management team or key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships and impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts and otherwise manage our business.\nWe indemnify our officers and directors against liability to us and our security holders, and such indemnification could increase our operating costs.\nOur bylaws allow us to indemnify our officers and directors against claims associated with carrying out the duties of their offices. Our bylaws also allow us to reimburse them for the costs of certain legal defenses. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our officers, directors or control persons, the SEC has advised that such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable.\nRisks Associated with Our Capital Stock\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf announcements about us or about our competitors or new product introductions;\n\u25cf developments concerning our product manufacturers;\n\u25cf the loss or unanticipated underperformance of our global distribution channel;\n\u25cf litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf conditions in the UAV, domestic hemp cultivation and drone-enabled package delivery industries;\n\u25cf governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25cf variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf foreign currency values and fluctuations; and\n\u25cf overall political and economic conditions, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, from the sale of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Nevada law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public reporting company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not otherwise incurred by a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations will continue to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nWe currently have outstanding, and we may in the future issue, instruments which are convertible into shares of Common Stock, which will result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nWe currently have an outstanding instrument which is convertible into shares of Common Stock, and we may need to issue similar instruments in the future. In the event that these convertible instruments are converted into shares of outstanding Common Stock, or that we make additional issuances of other convertible or exchangeable securities, you could experience additional dilution. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors or the then current market price.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment recommended to a customer is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the shares, resulting in fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our shares, potentially reducing a stockholder\u2019s ability to resell our securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analyst\u2019s cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities could decline.", "PERMNO": 14720, "SIC": 3721, "TIC": "UAVS"}
