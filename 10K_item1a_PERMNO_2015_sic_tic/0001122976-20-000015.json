RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nDemand for and supply of our products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, some of which we cannot predict or control.\nSeveral factors may affect the demand for and supply of our products and services, including:\n\u2022economic downturns or other volatility in the significant end markets that we serve;\n\u2022product obsolescence or technological changes that unfavorably alter the value/cost proposition of our products and services;\n\u2022competition from existing and unforeseen polymer and non-polymer based products;\n\u2022declines in general economic conditions or reductions in industrial production growth rates, both domestically and globally, which could impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay amounts owed to us;\n\u2022changes in environmental regulations that would limit our ability to sell our products and services in specific markets;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations regarding plastic materials; and\n\u2022inability to obtain raw materials or supply products to customers due to factors such as supplier work stoppages, supply shortages, plant outages or regulatory changes that may limit or prohibit overland transportation of certain hazardous materials and exogenous factors, like severe weather.\nIf any of these events occur, the demand for and supply of our products and services could suffer and potentially lead to asset impairment or otherwise adversely affect our results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to hazards and other risks associated with polymer production and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes.\nThe occurrence of an operating problem at our facilities (e.g., an explosion, a mechanical failure, a chemical spill or a discharge of toxic or hazardous substances) may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing or distribution facility or on our operations as a whole, during and after the period of these operating difficulties. Operating problems may cause personal injury and/or loss of life, customer attrition and severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. We are subject to present claims and potential future claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters. Our property and casualty insurance, which we believe are of the types and in the amounts that are customary for the industry, may not fully insure us against all potential hazards that are incident to our business or otherwise could occur.\n6 POLYONE CORPORATION\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations impact our operations and financial statements.\nOur operations on, and ownership of, real property are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at the national, state and local governmental levels (including, but not limited to, the RoHS and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008). The nature of our business exposes us to compliance costs and risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, transportation, recycling or disposal and/or sale of materials that can cause contamination and other harm to the environment or personal injury if they are improperly handled and released. Environmental compliance requirements imposed on us and our vendors may significantly increase the costs of these activities involving raw materials, energy, finished products and wastes. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, criminal or civil sanctions, damages, remediation costs or experience interruptions in our operations for violations of these laws.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by various risks inherent in conducting operations worldwide.\nOur operations are subject to risks; including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in local government regulations and policies including, but not limited to duty or tariff restrictions, foreign currency exchange controls or monetary policy, repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property, investment limitations and tax policies;\n\u2022risks associated with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), commonly known as \"Brexit\";\n\u2022political and economic instability and disruptions, including labor unrest, withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, natural disasters, major public health issues, civil strife, acts of war, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022legislation that regulates the use of chemicals;\n\u2022disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022compliance with international trade laws and regulations, including export control and economic sanctions;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022reduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas where our operations are conducted; and\n\u2022increasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including but not limited to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which UK voters approved an exit from the EU. The June 2016 referendum result, and the subsequent commencement of the official withdrawal process by the UK government in March 2017, has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU. The long-term nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty regarding when any relationship will be agreed and implemented. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to EU markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. It is possible that the withdrawal could, among other things, affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our businesses are subject, impact trade between the UK and the EU through potential restrictions on the free movement of goods and labor between the UK and the EU, create economic and political uncertainty in the region, and create other impediments to our ability to transact within and between the UK and EU. Less than 2% of our total consolidated sales originated in the UK and shipped to the EU for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, UK Bribery Act, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of\n7 POLYONE CORPORATION\nexport privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing demand for our products.\nNatural gas, electricity, fuel, logistics and raw material costs could cause volatility in our results.\nThe cost of our natural gas, electricity, fuel, logistics and raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices we receive for our products, either in the direction of the price change or in absolute magnitude. Natural gas and raw materials costs represent a substantial part of our manufacturing costs. Most of the raw materials we use are commodities and the price of each can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability because of major capacity additions or reductions or significant facility operating problems. Other external factors beyond our control can also cause fluctuations in raw materials prices, which could negatively impact demand for our products and cause volatility in our results.\nWe face competition from other companies.\nWe encounter competition in price, payment terms, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved.\nWe expect that our competitors will continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of our products. In addition, our competitors could cause a reduction in the selling prices of some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures could also result in the loss of customers.\nCybersecurity breaches, global information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks and products, which could harm our business.\nWe depend on integrated information systems to conduct our business, including communicating with employees and customers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to customers, and analyzing and reporting results of operations. In addition, we store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data, on our servers and databases. Cybersecurity breaches, global information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their recurrence; however, our systems, networks and products may nevertheless be vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other types of system failures. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats and system failures could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could cause customers to cancel orders or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global credit, financial and/or currency markets could limit our access to credit or otherwise harm our financial results, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nGlobal credit and financial markets experience volatility, including volatility in security prices, liquidity and credit availability, declining valuations of certain investments and significant changes in the capital and organizational structures of certain financial institutions. Market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenors than we prefer or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. dollar, whether precipitated by governmental monetary policy or otherwise, could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nThe agreements governing our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loan and other debt instruments, contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and in certain circumstances require us to meet financial maintenance tests, failure to comply with which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n8 POLYONE CORPORATION\nThe agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan, and the indentures and credit agreements governing our other debt, contain a number of customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: sell or otherwise transfer assets, including in a spin-off, incur additional debt or liens, consolidate or merge with any entity or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries, make capital investments and alter the business we conduct.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to comply under certain circumstances with specific financial tests, under which we are required to achieve certain or specific financial and operating results. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under such agreements and instruments, which in certain circumstances could be a default under all of these agreements and instruments. In the event of any default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the agreements, together with accrued interest thereon, to be due and payable. In such event, we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to pay debt then outstanding under the agreements governing our debt.\nFurthermore, certain of these agreements condition our ability to obtain additional borrowing capacity, engage in certain transactions or take certain other actions, on our achievement of certain or specific financial and operating results, although our failure to achieve such results would not result in a default under such agreements. Any future refinancing of our senior secured revolving credit facility or other debt may contain similar restrictive covenants.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, and any future goodwill impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill of $685.7 million. Additionally, in connection with our planned acquisition of Clariant Masterbatch, we expect that our goodwill will significantly increase. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a material negative change in relationships with customers, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, loss of key personnel or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, could result in goodwill impairment charges, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Based on our 2019 goodwill impairment test, performed as of October 1, 2019, no reporting units were identified as being at risk of future impairment. For additional information, see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d included in Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Relating to our Planned Acquisition of Clariant Masterbatch\nThe Clariant Acquisition may not occur at all or may not occur in the expected time frame, which may negatively impact our share price.\nOn December 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive share purchase agreement (the Agreement) with Clariant and a definitive business transfer agreement (the BTA) with Clariant India, pursuant to which, among other things, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, we will acquire Clariant Masterbatch.\nThe consummation of the Clariant Acquisition is not assured. The Clariant Acquisition is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks that the necessary regulatory approvals will not be obtained, the risk that PolyOne may be required to divest certain businesses or assets in connection with the Clariant Acquisition, or that other closing conditions will not be satisfied. We cannot predict whether and when such conditions will be required or satisfied.\nWe may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Clariant Acquisition or may experience other difficulties integrating Clariant Masterbatch.\nThe benefits that are expected to result from the Clariant Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the Clariant Acquisition. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of Clariant Masterbatch. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Clariant Masterbatch. The failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe will incur additional debt to complete the Clariant Acquisition. Our ability to generate cash to service this debt depends on many factors beyond our control.\n9 POLYONE CORPORATION\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total debt of approximately $1,242.8 million. We expect to incur approximately $650 million of debt to complete the Clariant Acquisition.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. A significant portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. Our cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of our debt when due, may be dependent upon cash dividends and other distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe degree to which we are currently leveraged and will be leveraged following the consummation of the Clariant Acquisition could have important consequences for shareholders.", "PERMNO": 88597, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "AVNT"}
