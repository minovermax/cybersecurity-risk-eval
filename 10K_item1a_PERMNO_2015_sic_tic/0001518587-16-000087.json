RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Business\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success depend in large part on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or be able to continue improving our operating results. In particular, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute our significant ongoing, or any future, strategic investments, achieve all operating cost savings targeted through focused productivity improvements and capacity optimization, further enhance our business and product mix, manage key commodity exposures and opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nPast and future acquisitions or divestitures may not be successful, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs part of our strategy, we may continue to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances, which may not be completed or, if completed, may not be ultimately beneficial to us. We also consider potential divestitures of non-strategic businesses from time to time. We prudently evaluate these opportunities as potential enhancements to our existing operating platforms and continue to consider strategic alternatives on an ongoing basis, including having discussions concerning potential acquisitions, strategic alliances and divestitures that may be material.\nThere are numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the following:\n\u25aa\nour ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition;\n\u25aa\nour ability to integrate new businesses into our operations;\n\u25aa\nthe availability of capital on acceptable terms to finance acquisitions;\n\u25aa\nthe ability to generate the cost savings or synergies anticipated;\n\u25aa\nthe inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u25aa\nincreasing demands on our operational systems; and\n\u25aa\nthe amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, the process of integrating new businesses could cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing businesses and the diversion of management\u2019s attention. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of new businesses or divestiture of existing businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, any acquisition we may make could result in significant increases in our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. The terms of our indebtedness may limit the acquisitions we can pursue.\nThere are numerous risks commonly encountered in divestitures, including the following:\n\u25aa\ndiversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, including providing on-going services to the divested business;\n\u25aa\nloss of key employees following such a transaction;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;\n\u25aa\nretention of future liabilities as a result of contractual indemnity obligations; and\n\u25aa\ndamage to our existing customer, supplier and other business relationships.\nIn addition, sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction, may involve conditions outside our control and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any such acquisition, strategic alliance or divestiture. If we do not realize any such anticipated benefits, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe cyclical nature of the metals industry, our end-uses and our customers\u2019 industries could limit our operating flexibility, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe metals industry in general is cyclical in nature. It tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general and local economic conditions. These conditions include the level of economic growth, financing availability, the availability of affordable raw materials and energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. Historically, in periods of recession or periods of minimal economic growth, metals companies have often tended to underperform other sectors. We are particularly sensitive to trends in the key end-uses we serve, which can lead to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products and services.\nDemand for our automotive products is dependent on the production of cars, light trucks and heavy duty vehicles and trailers. The automotive industry is highly cyclical, as new vehicle demand is dependent on consumer spending and is tied closely to the strength of the overall economy. Production cuts by manufacturers may adversely affect the demand for our products. Many automotive related manufacturers and first tier suppliers are burdened with substantial structural costs, including pension, healthcare and labor costs that have resulted in severe financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, for several of them. A worsening of these companies\u2019 financial condition or their bankruptcy could have further serious effects on the conditions of the automotive industry, which directly affects the demand for our products. In addition, sensitivity to fuel prices and consumer preferences can influence consumer demand for vehicles that have a higher content of aluminum. The loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of, one or more particular vehicle models for which we are a significant supplier could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from products sold to the aerospace industry, which is highly cyclical and tends to decline in response to overall declines in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of the U.S. and global economies and numerous other factors, including the effects of terrorism. A number of major airlines have undergone bankruptcy or comparable insolvency proceedings and experienced financial strain from volatile fuel prices. Despite existing backlogs, continued financial uncertainty in the industry, inadequate liquidity of certain airline companies, production issues and delays in the launch of new aircraft programs at major aircraft manufacturers, stock variations in the supply chain, terrorist acts or the increased threat of terrorism may lead to reduced demand for new aircraft that utilize our products, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe building and construction and truck trailer industries are both seasonal, highly cyclical and dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, during recessions or periods of low growth, the building and construction and truck trailer industries typically experience major cutbacks in production, resulting in decreased demand for aluminum.\nBecause we generally have high fixed costs, our near-term profitability is significantly affected by decreased processing volume. Accordingly, reduced demand and pricing pressures may significantly reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a prolonged recession in our principal industry end-uses have had a negative impact on our operations in the past and could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in recent years global economic and commodity trends have been increasingly correlated. Although we continue to seek to diversify our business on a geographic and industry end-use basis, we cannot assure you that diversification will significantly mitigate the effect of cyclical downturns.\nChanges in the market price of aluminum impact the selling prices of our products and the benefit we gain from using scrap in our manufacturing process. Market prices of aluminum are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which we have minimal or no control, including:\n\u25aa\nregional and global economic conditions;\n\u25aa\navailability and relative pricing of metal substitutes;\n\u25aa\nlabor costs;\n\u25aa\nenergy prices;\n\u25aa\nenvironmental and conservation regulations;\n\u25aa\nseasonal factors and weather; and\n\u25aa\nimport and export levels and/or restrictions.\nIn addition, we depend upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of our products to us and to our customers. Transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, increases in fuel prices, disruptions in rail service, port congestion or shortages of truck drivers, could increase our costs and disrupt our operations and our ability to service our customers on a timely basis.\nWe may encounter increases in the cost, or limited availability, of raw materials and energy, which could cause our cost of goods sold to increase thereby reducing operating results and limiting our operating flexibility.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials and energy in our business, consisting principally of primary aluminum, aluminum scrap, alloys and other materials, and energy, including natural gas. Any substantial increases in the cost of raw materials or energy could cause our operating costs to increase and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrimary aluminum, aluminum scrap, rolling slab and hardener prices are subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations. Metallics (primary aluminum and aluminum scrap) represent the largest component of our costs of sales. We purchase aluminum primarily from aluminum producers, aluminum scrap dealers and other intermediaries. We have limited control over the price or availability of these supplies.\nThe availability and price of aluminum scrap and rolling slab depend on a number of factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, international demand for metallics and internal recycling activities by primary aluminum producers and other consumers of aluminum. We rely on third parties for the supply of alloyed rolling slab for certain products. In the future, we may face an increased risk of supply to meet our demand due to issues with suppliers and their rising costs of production and their ability to sustain their business. Our inability to satisfy our future supply needs may impact our profitability and expose us to penalties as a result of contractual commitments with some of our customers. The availability and price of rolling slab could impact our margins and our ability to meet customer volumes. Increased regional and global demand for aluminum scrap can have the effect of increasing the prices that we pay for these raw materials thereby increasing our cost of sales. We may not be able to adjust the selling prices for our products to recover the increases in scrap prices. If scrap prices were to increase significantly without a commensurate increase in the traded value of the primary metals, our future financial condition and results of operations could be affected by higher costs and lower profitability.\nAfter raw material and labor costs, utilities represent the third largest component of our cost of sales. The price of natural gas, and therefore the costs, can be particularly volatile. Price and volatility can differ by global region based on supply and demand, political issues and government regulation, among other things. As a result, our natural gas costs may fluctuate dramatically, and we may not be able to reduce the effect of higher natural gas costs on our cost of sales. If natural gas costs increase, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Although we attempt to mitigate volatility in natural gas costs through the use of hedging and the inclusion of price escalators in certain of our long-term supply contracts, we may not be able to eliminate or reduce the effects of such cost volatility. Furthermore, in an effort to offset the effect of increasing costs, we may also limit our potential benefit from declining costs.\nWe may be unable to manage effectively our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and our hedging activities may affect profitability in a changing metals price environment and subject our earnings to greater volatility from period-to-period.\nSignificant increases in the price of primary aluminum, aluminum scrap, alloys, hardeners, or energy would cause our cost of sales to increase significantly and, if not offset by product price increases, would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are substantial consumers of raw materials, and by far the largest input cost in producing our goods is the cost of aluminum. The cost of energy used by us is also substantial. Customers pay for our products based on the price of the aluminum contained in the products, plus a \u201crolling margin\u201d or \u201cconversion margin\u201d fee (the \u201cPrice Margin\u201d), or based on a fixed price. In general, we use this pricing mechanism to pass changes in the price of aluminum, and, sometimes, in the price of natural gas, through to our customers. In most end-uses and by industry convention, however, we offer our products at times on a fixed price basis as a service to the customer. This commitment to supply an aluminum-based product to a customer at a fixed price often extends months, but sometimes years, into the future. Such commitments require us to purchase raw materials in the future, exposing us to the risk that increased aluminum or natural gas prices will increase the cost of our products, thereby reducing or eliminating the Price Margin we receive when we deliver the product. These risks may be exacerbated by the failure of our customers to pay for products on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components, including the underlying base metal component, which is typically based on quoted prices from the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the regional premium, which comprises the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the delivery of metal to a particular region as further described below. The LME price is typically driven by macroeconomic factors, global supply and demand of aluminum (including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories) and financial investors. Speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have contributed to higher levels of price volatility. Furthermore, the North America and Europe segments are exposed to variability in the market price of a premium differential (referred to as \u201cMidwest Premium\u201d in the U.S. and \u201cDuty Paid/Unpaid Rotterdam\u201d in Europe) charged by industry participants to deliver aluminum from the smelter to the manufacturing facility. This premium differential also fluctuates in relation to several conditions, including the extent of warehouse financing transactions, which limit the amount of physical metal flowing to consumers and increases the price differential as a result. During times of greater volatility in the premium, the variability in our earnings can also increase. In addition to impacting the price we pay for the raw materials we purchase, changing premium differentials impact our customers, who may delay purchases from us during times of uncertainty with respect to the premium differential or seek to purchase lower priced imported products which are not susceptible to the changes in these premium differentials. The North America and Europe segments follow a pattern of increasing or decreasing their selling prices to customers in response to changes in the Midwest Premium and the Duty Paid/Unpaid Rotterdam. In addition, aluminum prices could fluctuate as a result of new LME warehousing rules. In February 2015, the LME implemented new rules that require LME warehouses, under certain conditions, to deliver out more aluminum than they take in. The new warehousing rules could cause an increase in the supply of aluminum to enter the physical market and may cause regional delivery premiums and LME aluminum prices to fall. A sustained weak LME aluminum pricing environment, deterioration in LME aluminum prices or a decrease in regional premiums could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flow.\nSimilarly, as we maintain large quantities of base inventory, significant and rapid decreases in the price of primary aluminum would reduce the realizable value of our inventory, negatively affecting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a drop in aluminum prices between the date of purchase and the final settlement date on derivative contracts used to mitigate the risk of price fluctuations may require us to post additional margin, which, in turn, could place a significant demand on our liquidity.\nWe purchase and sell LME forwards, futures and options contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in aluminum, copper and zinc prices. The ability to realize the benefit of our hedging program is dependent upon factors beyond our control, such as counterparty risk as well as our customers making timely payment to us for products. In addition, at certain times, hedging options may be unavailable or not available on terms acceptable to us. In certain scenarios when market price movements result in a decline in value of our current derivatives position, our mark-to-market expense may exceed our credit line and counterparties may request the posting of cash collateral. Despite the use of LME forwards, futures and options contracts, we remain exposed to the variability in prices of aluminum scrap. While aluminum scrap is typically priced in relation to prevailing LME prices, it may also be priced at a discount to LME aluminum (depending upon the quality of the material supplied). This discount is referred to in the industry as the \u201cscrap spread\u201d and fluctuates depending upon industry conditions. In addition, we purchase forwards, futures or options contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas and fuel prices and currency risks. We do not account for our forwards, futures, or options contracts as hedges of the underlying risks. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on our derivative financial instruments must be reported in our consolidated results of operations. The inclusion of such unrealized gains and losses in earnings may produce significant period to period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our underlying operating performance. See Item 7A. - \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nThe profitability of our operations depends, in part, on the availability of an adequate source of supplies.\nWe depend on scrap for our operations and acquire our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metals to us. In periods of low industry prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap and wait for higher prices. In addition, the slowdown in industrial production and consumer consumption in the U.S. during the previous economic crisis reduced the supply of scrap metal available to us. Furthermore, exports of scrap out of North America and Europe can negatively impact scrap availability and scrap spreads. If an adequate supply of scrap metal is not available to us, we would be unable to use recycled metals in our products at desired volumes and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operating segments depend on external suppliers for rolling slab for certain products. The availability of rolling slab is dependent upon a number of factors, including general economic conditions, which can impact the supply of available rolling slab and LME pricing, where lower LME prices may cause certain rolling slab producers to curtail production. If rolling slab is less available, our margins could be impacted by higher premiums that we may not be able to pass along to our customers or we may not be able to meet the volume requirements of our customers, which may cause sales losses or result in damage claims from our customers. We maintain long-term contracts for certain volumes of our rolling slab requirements, for the remainder we depend on annual and spot purchases. If we enter into a period of persistent short supply, we could incur significant capital expenditures to internally produce 100% of our rolling slab requirements.\nOur business requires substantial amounts of capital to operate; failure to maintain sufficient liquidity will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires substantial amounts of cash to operate and our liquidity and ability to access capital can be adversely affected by a number of factors outside our control. Fluctuations in the LME prices for aluminum may result in increased cash costs for metal or scrap. In addition, if aluminum price movements result in a negative valuation of our current financial derivative positions, our counterparties may require posting of cash collateral. Furthermore, in an environment of falling LME prices, the borrowing base and availability under Aleris International\u2019s asset backed multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \u201c2015 ABL Facility\u201d) may shrink and constrain our liquidity.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the industry end-uses we serve and aluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce our share of industry sales, sales volumes and selling prices.\nAluminum competes with other materials such as steel, plastic, composite materials and glass for various applications. Higher aluminum prices tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials. We compete in the production and sale of rolled aluminum products with a number of other aluminum rolling mills, including large, single-purpose sheet mills, continuous casters and other multi-purpose mills, some of which are larger and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. We compete with other rolled products suppliers, principally multipurpose mills, on the basis of quality, price, timeliness of delivery, technological innovation and customer service. Producers with a different cost basis may, in certain circumstances, have a competitive pricing advantage. In addition, a current or new competitor may also add or build new capacity, which could diminish our profitability by decreasing the equilibrium prices in our markets. Our competitive position may also be affected by economies of scale in purchasing, production and sales, which accrue to the benefit of some of our competitors, exchange rate fluctuations that may make our products less competitive in relation to products of companies based in other countries and changes in regulation that have a disproportionately negative effect on us or our methods of production. In addition, technological innovation is important to our customers who require us to lead or keep pace with new innovations to address their needs.\nAs we increase our international business, we encounter the risk that non-U.S. governments could take actions to enhance local production or local ownership at our expense. In addition, new competitors could emerge globally in emerging or transitioning markets with abundant natural resources, low-cost labor and energy, and lower environmental and other standards. This may pose a significant competitive threat to our business. Our competitive position may also be affected by exchange rate fluctuations that may make our products less competitive.\nAdditional competition could result in a reduced share of industry sales or reduced prices for our products and services, which could decrease revenues or reduce volumes, either of which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of certain members of our management may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business. If we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our senior officers, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. Moreover, the pool of qualified individuals may be highly\ncompetitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees, should the need arise.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our largest customers, our sales volumes, revenues and cash flows could be reduced.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. Our ten largest customers were responsible for less than 30% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of those revenues. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, our strategy of having dedicated facilities and arrangements with customers subjects us to the inherent risk of increased dependence on a single or a few customers with respect to these facilities. In such cases, the loss of such a customer, or the reduction of that customer\u2019s business at one or more of our facilities, could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and we may be unable to timely replace, or replace at all, lost order volumes. In addition, several of our customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to us in recent years. Similar incidents in the future would adversely impact our financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of our customers, and our sales volumes and revenues could be reduced if our customers switch their suppliers.\nApproximately 66% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were generated from customers who do not have long-term contractual arrangements with us. These customers purchase products and services from us on a purchase order basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. Any significant loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material negative impact on our sales volume and business.\nOur business requires substantial capital investments that we may be unable to fulfill.\nOur operations are capital intensive. The capital expenditures of our continuing operations were $313.6 million, $164.8 million and $238.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures over the past three years include spending related to maintenance and our strategic investments, including the Zhenjiang rolling mill. We are currently investing over $400.0 million to add ABS capabilities at our rolling mill in Lewisport, Kentucky in order to meet increasing demand in North America. We began construction in the fourth quarter of 2014 and expect to begin shipping ABS from this facility in 2017. We may not generate sufficient operating cash flows and our external financing sources may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to make anticipated capital expenditures, service or refinance our indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. In addition, if the cost of our capital expenditures exceed budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for completion is longer than initially anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to make upgrades or purchase new plants and equipment, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected by higher maintenance costs, lower sales volumes due to the impact of reduced product quality, and other competitive influences.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives.\nWe have invested in, and are involved with, a number of technology and process initiatives. Several technical aspects of these initiatives are still unproven, and the eventual commercial outcomes cannot be assessed with any certainty. Even if we are successful with these initiatives, we may not be able to deploy them in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the costs and benefits from our investments in new technologies and the consequent effects on our financial results may vary from present expectations.\nOur Asia Pacific operations may require significant funding support that we may be unable to fulfill.\nThe Zhenjiang rolling mill began limited production in the beginning of 2013. We continued the start-up phase of that operation through 2014, growing our sales as the year progressed, and exited the start-up phase of operations in the first quarter of 2015. The mill required funding for residual capital expenditures, working capital, and principal and interest on third party debt, reaching an aggregate of $36.8 million in 2015. This funding was obtained from an RMB 410.0 million (or equivalent to approximately $63.1 million) revolving credit facility (the \u201cZhenjiang Revolver\u201d) provided by the People\u2019s Bank of China and with capital provided by us.\nSignificant investment in the Zhenjiang rolling mill is needed to fund our anticipated future sales growth. Working capital requirements are anticipated to be funded under the Zhenjiang Revolver and with capital provided by us. The Chinese government exercises significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, including imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways, so we may experience future disruptions to our access to capital in the Chinese market. In addition, we have to meet certain conditions to be able to draw on the Zhenjiang\nRevolver. We cannot be certain that we will be able to draw all amounts committed under the Zhenjiang Revolver in the future. We also may not generate sufficient operating cash flows and our external financing sources may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund the anticipated working capital needs of the Zhenjiang rolling mill. To the extent that funding is not available under the Zhenjiang Revolver, we may need to increase the amount of capital necessary to fund the Zhenjiang rolling mill from our own or other sources of capital. The availability of financing, as well as future actions or policies of the Chinese government, could materially affect the funding of our working capital needs in China, which may delay our ability to produce and sell material from the Zhenjiang rolling mill.\nOur business involves significant activity in Europe, and adverse conditions and disruptions in European economies could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance.\nA material portion of our sales are generated by customers located in Europe and the euro is the functional currency of substantially all of our European-based operations. The financial markets remain concerned about the ability of certain European countries to finance their deficits and service growing debt burdens amidst difficult economic conditions. This loss of confidence has led to rescue measures by Eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. In addition, the actions required to be taken by those countries as a condition to rescue packages, and by other countries to mitigate similar developments in their economies, have resulted in increased political discord within and among Eurozone countries. The interdependencies among European economies and financial institutions have also exacerbated concern regarding the stability of European financial markets generally. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have a material adverse impact on the capital markets generally. Persistent disruptions in the European financial markets, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency or the failure of a significant European financial institution, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial performance.\nOur international operations expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad.\nWe have operations in Germany, Belgium and China. We continue to explore opportunities to expand our international operations. Our international operations generally are subject to risks, including:\n\u25aa\nchanges in U.S. and international governmental regulations, trade restrictions and laws, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u25aa\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u25aa\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25aa\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u25aa\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises or government policies favoring local production;\n\u25aa\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u25aa\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u25aa\ncurrency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits;\n\u25aa\ndiffering protections for intellectual property and enforcement thereof;\n\u25aa\ndiffering and, in some cases, more stringent labor regulations;\n\u25aa\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u25aa\npolitical, economic and social instability.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could cause our costs to rise, limit growth opportunities or have a negative effect on our operations and our ability to plan for future periods, and subject us to risks not generally prevalent in the U.S.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of our operating entities are reported in various currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies may have a negative impact on reported revenues and operating profit while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these currencies may generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit. In addition, a portion of the revenues generated by our international operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the majority of costs incurred are denominated in local currencies. As a result, appreciation in the U.S. dollar may have a positive impact on margins at the time of sale and on the subsequent translation of the resulting accounts receivable until\ncollection, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have the opposite effect. While we engage in hedging activity to attempt to mitigate currency risk, this may not fully protect our business, financial condition or results of operations from adverse effects due to currency fluctuations.\nCurrent environmental liabilities as well as the cost of compliance with, and liabilities under, health and safety laws could increase our operating costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites and employee health and safety. Future environmental regulations could impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which we operate. Additional pollution control equipment, process changes, or other environmental control measures may be needed at some of our facilities to meet future requirements.\nFinancial responsibility for contaminated property can be imposed on us where current operations have had an environmental impact. Such liability can include the cost of investigating and remediating contaminated soil or ground water, fines and penalties sought by environmental authorities, and damages arising out of personal injury, contaminated property and other toxic tort claims, as well as lost or impaired natural resources. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for certain kinds of matters, such that a person can be held liable without regard to fault for all of the costs of a matter even though others were also involved or responsible. The costs of all such matters have not been material to net income (loss) for any accounting period since January 1, 2011. However, future remedial requirements at currently owned or operated properties or adjacent areas could result in significant liabilities.\nChanges in environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement could materially increase our costs. For example, if salt cake, a by-product from some of our operations, were to become classified as a hazardous waste in the U.S., the costs to manage and dispose of it would increase and could result in significant increased expenditures.\nNew governmental regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations.\nClimate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are legislative and regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where we have manufacturing facilities, are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of our manufacturing facilities use significant amounts of energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of our facilities emit amounts of greenhouse gas above certain minimum thresholds that are likely to be affected by existing proposals. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could significantly increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our business, operations or financial results. While future emission regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict how this regulation may affect our business, operations or financial results.\nWe could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business.\nApproximately 64% of our U.S. employees and substantially all of our non-U.S. employees, located primarily in Europe where union membership is common, are represented by unions or equivalent bodies and are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements which are subject to periodic renegotiation. Although we believe that we will successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements when the current agreements expire, these negotiations may not prove successful, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption or cessation of our operations.\nLabor negotiations may not conclude successfully, and, in that case or any other, work stoppages or labor disturbances may occur. Any such stoppages or disturbances may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations by limiting plant production, sales volumes and profitability.\nFurther aluminum industry consolidation could impact our business.\nThe aluminum industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years, and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted our business, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.\nOur operations present significant risk of injury or death. We may be subject to claims that are not covered by or exceed our insurance.\nBecause of the heavy industrial activities conducted at our facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to our employees or other visitors, notwithstanding the safety precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has from time to time levied fines against us for certain isolated incidents. While we have in place policies to minimize such risks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to unplanned business interruptions that may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations may be materially adversely affected by unplanned events such as explosions, fires, war or terrorism, inclement weather, accidents, equipment, information technology systems and process failures, electrical blackouts or outages, transportation interruptions and supply interruptions. Operational interruptions at one or more of our production facilities could cause substantial losses and delays in our production capacity or increase our operating costs. In addition, replacement of assets damaged by such events could be difficult or expensive, and to the extent these losses are not covered by insurance or our insurance policies have significant deductibles, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by such events. Furthermore, because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us, customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us, and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Interruptions may also harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business.\nDerivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of our hedging activities.\nWe use over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives products to hedge our metal commodity, energy and currency risks and, historically, our interest rate risk. Legislation has been adopted to increase the regulatory oversight of the OTC derivatives markets and impose restrictions on certain derivatives transactions and participants in these markets, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. In the U.S., for example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d or \u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act includes extensive provisions regulating the derivatives market, and many of the regulations implementing the derivatives provisions have become effective and additional requirements will become effective in the future. As such, we have become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs, both directly and indirectly, through increased costs of doing business with more market intermediaries that are now subject to extensive regulation pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, derivatives dealers may seek to pass to us the cost of any increased margin, capital or other regulatory requirements that they are subject to under Dodd-Frank, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of our hedging activities. As the regulatory regime is still developing and additional regulations have not been finalized or fully implemented, the ultimate costs of Dodd-Frank and similar legislation in other jurisdictions, including the European Union member states, on our business remain uncertain. However, such costs could be significant and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally that impact the derivatives market and market participants could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pension obligations are currently underfunded. We may have to make significant cash payments to our pension plans, which would reduce the cash available for our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur U.S. defined benefit pension plans cover certain salaried and non-salaried employees at our corporate headquarters and within our North America segment. The plan benefits are based on age, years of service and employees\u2019 eligible compensation during employment for all employees not covered under a collective bargaining agreement and on stated amounts based on job grade and years of service prior to retirement for non-salaried employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Our funding policy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans is to make annual contributions based on advice from our actuaries and the evaluation of our cash position, but not less than minimum statutory requirements. All of the minimum funding requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d) for these plans have been met as of December 31, 2015, at which time, the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, in the aggregate, were underfunded (on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) basis) by approximately $50.6 million. The liabilities could increase or decrease, depending on a number of factors, including future changes in benefits, investment returns, and the assumptions used to calculate the liability. The current underfunded status of the U.S. defined benefit plans requires us to notify the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d)\nof certain \u201creportable events,\u201d (within the meaning of ERISA), including if we pay certain extraordinary dividends. Under Title IV of ERISA, the PBGC has the authority under certain circumstances or upon the occurrence of certain events to terminate an underfunded pension plan. One such circumstance is the occurrence of an event that unreasonably increases the risk of unreasonably large losses to the PBGC. We believe it is unlikely that the PBGC would terminate any of our plans, which would result in our incurring a liability to the PBGC that could be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding. However, in the event we increase our indebtedness and/or pay an extraordinary dividend, the PBGC could enter into a negotiation with us that could cause us to materially increase or accelerate our funding obligations under our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The occurrence of either of those actions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nOur global operations are managed through numerous information technology systems. If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we are continually modifying and enhancing our information systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency. As new systems and technologies are implemented, we could experience unanticipated difficulties resulting in unexpected costs and adverse impacts to our manufacturing and other business processes. When implemented, the information systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to ongoing operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur.\nEach quarter, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, which includes a review of the objectives, design, implementation and effect of the controls relating to the information generated for use in our financial reports. In the course of our controls evaluation, we seek to identify data errors or control problems and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including process improvements, are being undertaken. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures will be maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be satisfied. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in our decision-making could be faulty, and that isolated breakdowns could occur because of simple human error or mistake. We cannot provide absolute assurance that all possible control issues within our company have been detected. The design of our system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed absolutely in achieving our stated goals. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements could occur and not be detected. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operating flexibility.\nWe have substantial consolidated debt and, as a result, significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness was $1.1 billion, excluding $19.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. We also would have had the ability to borrow up to $373.2 million under the 2015 ABL Facility. Aleris Zhenjiang, which is an unrestricted subsidiary and non-guarantor under the indentures governing the $500.0 million aggregate original principal amount of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \u201c7 5/8% Senior Notes\u201d) and the $500.0 million aggregate original principal amount of 7 7/8% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201c7 7/8% Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 7 5/8% Senior Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), had the ability to borrow up to an additional $63.1 million (on a U.S. dollar equivalent subject to exchange rate fluctuations) under the Zhenjiang Revolver. Our substantial level of debt and debt service obligations could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25aa\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25aa\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;\n\u25aa\nexposing our cash flows to changes in floating rates of interest such that an increase in floating rates could negatively impact our cash flows;\n\u25aa\nimposing additional restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business under financing documents, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, make investments, incur additional debt and sell assets; and\n\u25aa\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, other debt obligations and other general corporate requirements, because we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to service debt obligations.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. Although the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreement governing the 2015 ABL Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Aleris International\u2019s ability to borrow under the 2015 ABL Facility will remain limited by the amount of the borrowing base. In addition, the credit agreement governing the 2015 ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes allow Aleris International to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with acquisitions and a significant amount of purchase money debt. If new debt is added to our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they face would be increased.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will primarily depend upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments to satisfy our debt obligations. Included in such factors are the requirements, under certain scenarios, of our counterparties that we post cash collateral to maintain our hedging positions. In addition, price declines, by reducing the borrowing base, could limit availability under the 2015 ABL Facility and further constrain our liquidity.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Senior Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indentures governing the Senior Notes may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives, which in turn could exacerbate the effects of any failure to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance our obligations at all or on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to business changes or to take certain actions, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Senior Notes.\nThe terms of the 2015 ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nThe credit agreement governing the 2015 ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. The indentures governing the Senior Notes and the credit agreement governing the 2015 ABL Facility include covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Aleris International and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 to:\n\u25aa\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u25aa\npay dividends on capital stock and make other restricted payments;\n\u25aa\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u25aa\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u25aa\nsell assets;\n\u25aa\nmerge or consolidate with other entities; and\n\u25aa\ncreate liens.\nIn addition, Aleris International\u2019s ability to borrow under the 2015 ABL Facility is limited by a borrowing base and, under certain circumstances, the 2015 ABL Facility requires Aleris International to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and may require Aleris International to reduce its debt or take other actions in order to comply with this ratio. See Note 9, \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further details. Moreover, the 2015 ABL Facility provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability and other reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to Aleris International. There can be no assurance that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or, were it to do so, that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity.\nA breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under the 2015 ABL Facility or either of the indentures governing the Senior Notes, as the case may be, that would allow lenders or noteholders, as applicable, to declare the applicable outstanding debt immediately due and payable. If we are unable to pay those amounts because we do not have sufficient cash on hand or are unable to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or, in the case of the 2015 ABL Facility, proceed against any assets that serve as collateral to secure such debt. The lenders under the 2015 ABL Facility will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand future downturns in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of limitations imposed on Aleris International and its subsidiaries by the restrictive covenants under the 2015 ABL Facility and the Senior Notes.\nA downgrade of our ratings by a credit rating agency could impair our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our business relationships could be adversely affected.\nA deterioration of our financial position or a downgrade of our credit ratings for any reason could limit our ability to obtain future financing, increase our borrowing costs, trigger the posting of cash collateral and have an adverse effect on our business relationships with customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties. As discussed above, we enter into various forms of hedging arrangements against commodity, energy and currency risks. Financial strength and credit ratings are important to the availability and terms of these hedging and financing activities. As a result, any downgrade of our credit ratings may make it more costly for us to engage in these activities.", "PERMNO": 75558, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "6685B"}
