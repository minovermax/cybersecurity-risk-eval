Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.\nIf we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.\nWe maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in long-tail and long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves. This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial.\nWe are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:\n\u2022\nuncertainty in future medical costs in workers' compensation. In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased healthcare utilization; and/or the future costs of healthcare facilities. In addition, the relationship between workers' compensation and government and private healthcare providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers' compensation;\n\u2022\nincreased uncertainty related to medical professional liability, medical products liability and workers\u2019 compensation coverages resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;\n\u2022\nsignificant class action litigation; and\n\u2022\nmass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.\nIn light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.\nOur key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies could vary significantly from actual experience.\nOur reserves for long term care policies are based on key assumptions including morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future rate increases. These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain. If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.\nEstimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical data and industry data available to us, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status. Morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, overall population mortality trends, advances in medical care and voluntary lapse experience.\nA prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves. This risk is more significant for long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the rate increases we request. Any adverse deviation of future rate increases approved relative to our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.\nIf our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.\nCatastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.\nCatastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.\nThe extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any. As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to \u201cunconventional\u201d terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted on January 12, 2015. The reauthorization provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks for another six years with increases to the insurer co-payment and program trigger. The existence of the mitigating effects of such law is part of the analysis of our overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, our risk positioning may change if such law were modified.\nWe have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.\nOur property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.\nOn August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer). The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer at December 31, 2014 is $2.5 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, our liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings. These charges could be substantial.\nWe face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nAll aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, we purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.\nWe may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.\nWe have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship. Such action increases the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If the amounts we collect from reinsurers are less than the amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, our net incurred losses will be higher.\nWe may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.\nA portion of our business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. As a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. If the amounts we collect from policyholders are less than the amounts recorded, our incurred losses will be higher.\nWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity and currency, many of which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity and currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.\nWe have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments. The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold. Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.\nIn addition, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.\nAs a result of all of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on the disposition of our investments and may be required to write down the value of our investments.\nOur valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment, which is inherently uncertain.\nWe exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in our investment portfolio, including those that are not regularly traded in active markets. We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities can be particularly sensitive to small changes in collateral performance.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of our investments are required.\nChanges in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFederal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits. Other potential tax law changes, including the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations. Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.\nThe shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner. This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.\nA significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.\nThe foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposure includes substantially increased compliance costs and computer system upgrading and security-related investments. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nLoss of key vendor relationships, issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships or exposure relating to claim administration and claim adjudication functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.\nIn the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.\nAdditionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrator of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions. Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.\nWe face considerable competition within our industry for qualified personnel and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.\nThe successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent. Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with industry experience, we may encounter significant obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.\nInsurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business. If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital. We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.\nOur insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.\nRating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.\nThe rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.\nIn addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.\nWe are subject to extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.\nThe insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors. Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business, generally at the state level. Any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on us. In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.\nThese rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;\n\u2022\nthe required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;\n\u2022\npotential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;\n\u2022\nlicensing of insurers and agents;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel, increase rates or change terms and conditions in policies.\nRegulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.", "PERMNO": 47626, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "CNA"}
