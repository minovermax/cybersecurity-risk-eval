{"cik": "811808", "company": "SUMMIT FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe, like other financial holding companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (i) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan clients or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (ii) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads, (iii) liquidity risk, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to the Company such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (iv) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks.\nIn addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur business is concentrated in West Virginia and northern Virginia. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes if there are changes in the economic conditions in these areas. A prolonged period of economic recession or other adverse economic conditions in these areas could have a negative impact on Summit. A significant decline in general economic conditions nationally, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets, declines in the housing market, a tightening credit environment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. economy was in recession from December 2007 through June 2009. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. was greatly reduced. Although economic conditions have improved, certain sectors continue to recover and significant numbers of individuals are underemployed or have even given up seeking employment. Financial stress on borrowers as a result of an uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, local governments and many businesses are still experiencing difficulty due to lower consumer spending and decreased liquidity in the credit markets. Deterioration in local economic conditions, particularly within our geographic regions and markets, could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions that negatively affect real estate values and the job market have resulted, and may continue to result, in deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolios, and such deterioration in credit quality has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nMarket developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u2022\nWe expect to face increased regulation of our industry, and compliance with such regulation may increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase compliance challenges.\nAs the above conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, or other institutional firms. Defaults by financial services institutions,\nand even rumors or questions about a financial institution or the financial services industry in general, have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nThe Company and Summit Community are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1. Business on page 1.\nWe may become subject to additional regulatory restrictions in the event that our regulatory capital levels decline.\nAlthough the Bank is qualified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action as of December 31, 2014, there is no guarantee that we will not have a decline in our capital category in the future. In the event of such a capital category decline, we would be subject to increased regulatory restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nIf a bank is classified as undercapitalized, the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the FDIC. Pursuant to FDICIA, an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets, engaging in a new line of business, acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution, or opening or acquiring a new branch office, except under certain circumstances, including the acceptance by the FDIC of a capital restoration plan for the bank. Furthermore, if a state non-member bank is classified as undercapitalized, the FDIC may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank; if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, the FDIC would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions. These actions would include, among other things, requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital; improvements in management; limits on interest rates paid; prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers. If a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized, FDICIA requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within ninety (90) days, unless the Federal Reserve determines that other action would better achieve the purposes of FDICIA regarding prompt corrective action with respect to undercapitalized banks.\nUnder FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. \u201cWell capitalized\u201d banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but all banks that are not well capitalized could be restricted from accepting such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. These restrictions could materially and adversely affect our ability to access lower costs funds and thereby decrease our future earnings capacity.\nOur financial flexibility could be severely constrained if we are unable to renew our wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available in the future at acceptable rates of interest. We may not have sufficient liquidity to continue to fund new loan originations, and we may need to liquidate loans or other assets unexpectedly in order to repay obligations as they mature. Our inability to obtain regulatory consent to accept or renew brokered deposits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects and our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFinally, the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank, the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank, and the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects. Under FDICIA, the FDIC is required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every twelve (12) months. An exception to this rule is made, however, that provides that banks (i) with assets of less than $100.0 million, (ii) that are categorized as \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d (iii) that were found to be well managed and whose composite rating was outstanding and (iv) that have not been subject to a change in control during the last twelve (12) months, need only be examined by the FDIC once every eighteen (18) months.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate, and our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nOur loan portfolio subjects us to credit risk. Inherent risks in lending also include fluctuations in collateral values and economic downturns. Making loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a risk that our loans will not be repaid.\nWe attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses totaled $11.2 million, which represents approximately 1.08% of our total loans. There is no precise method of predicting loan losses, and therefore, we always face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and that we would need to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses.\nOur methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans into various categories and the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. For non-classified loans, the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on at least an annual basis. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the estimated allowance for non-classified loans is adjusted for the probable effect that current environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use. While our allowance for loan losses is established in different portfolio components, we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all estimated probable credit losses inherent in our portfolio.\nIn addition, the FDIC as well as the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to establish additional reserves. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in our net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow our assets.\nWe do business with other financial institutions that could experience financial difficulty.\nWe do business through the purchase and sale of Federal funds, check clearing and through the purchase and sale of loan participations with other financial institutions. Because these financial institutions have many risks, as do we, we could be adversely affected should one of these financial institutions experience significant financial difficulties or fail to comply with our agreements with them.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on funding sources to meet our liquidity needs, such as brokered deposits and FHLB borrowings, which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be adversely affected by general economic conditions.\nWe have frequently utilized, as a source of funds, certificates of deposit obtained through third parties that solicit funds from their customers for deposit with us, or brokered deposits. Brokered deposits, when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network, are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets and could reduce our net interest spread and net interest margin. In addition, brokered deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition. As of December 31, 2014, brokered deposits totaled $146.9 million, or approximately 13.8% of our total deposits, compared to brokered deposits in the amount of $160.8 million or approximately\n16.0% of our total deposits at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $40.5 million in brokered deposits, or approximately 27.6% of our total brokered deposits, mature within one year. Our ability to continue to acquire brokered deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels, which may increase our funding costs and the confidence of the market. In addition, if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current regulatory guidelines, we could be restricted from using brokered deposits as a funding source.\nWe also have borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, or the FHLB. As of December 31, 2014, our FHLB borrowings maturing within one year totaled $121.0 million. If we were unable to borrow from the FHLB in the future, we may be required to seek higher cost funding sources, which could materially and adversely affect our net interest income.\nOne aspect of our liquidity management process is establishing contingent liquidity funding plans under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages or events. The following represents three \u201cstressed\u201d liquidity circumstances and our related contingency plans with respect to each.\nScenario 1 - Summit Community\u2019s capital status becomes less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d. Banks which are less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines are prohibited from issuing new brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC to do so. In the event Summit Community\u2019s capital status were to fall below well capitalized and was not successful in obtaining the FDIC\u2019s waiver to issue new brokered deposits, Summit Community:\n\u2022\nWould have limited amounts of maturing brokered deposits to replace in the short-term, as we have limited our brokered deposits maturing in any one quarter to no more than $50 million.\n\u2022\nPresently has $631 million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon to fund maturing brokered deposits until Summit Community had restored its capital to well capitalized status.\n\u2022\nWould first seek to restore its capital to well capitalized status through capital contributions from Summit, its parent holding company.\n\u2022\nWould generally have no more than $100 million in brokered deposits maturing in any one year time frame, which is well within its presently available sources of liquid funds, if in the event Summit does not have the capital resources to restore Summit Community\u2019s capital to well capitalized status. One year would give Summit Community ample time to raise alternative funds either through retail deposits or the sale of assets, and obtain capital resources to restore it to well capitalized status.\nScenario 2 - Summit Community\u2019s credit quality deteriorates such that the FHLB restricts further advances. If in the event that the Bank\u2019s credit quality deteriorated to the point that further advances under its line with the FHLB were restricted, Summit Community:\n\u2022\nWould severely curtail lending and other growth activities until such time as access to this line could be restored, thus eliminating the need for net new advances.\n\u2022\nWould still have available current liquid funding sources secured by unemcumbered loans and securities totaling $295 million aside from its FHLB line, which would result in a funding source of approximately $228 million.\nScenario 3 - A competitive financial institution offers a retail deposit program at interest rates significantly above current market rates in the Summit Community\u2019s market areas. If a competitive financial institution offered a retail deposit program at rates well in excess of current market rates in the Summit Community\u2019s market area, the Bank:\n\u2022\nPresently has $631 million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon immediately to fund any \u201cnet run off\u201d of deposits from this activity.\n\u2022\nWould severely curtail lending and other growth activities so as to preserve the availability of as much contingency funds as possible.\n\u2022\nWould begin offering its own competitive deposit program when deemed prudent so as to restore the retail deposits lost to the competition.\nWe operate in a very competitive industry and market.\nWe face aggressive competition not only from banks, but also from other financial services companies, including finance companies and credit unions, and, to a limited degree, from other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, and consumer finance companies. A number of competitors in our market areas are larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations\nthat govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. Our profitability depends upon our ability to attract loans and deposits. There is a risk that aggressive competition could result in our controlling a smaller share of our markets. A decline in market share could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on those properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our future earnings.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow. Our income and cash flow depend primarily on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rates are beyond our control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence loan originations, purchases of investments, volumes of deposits, and rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve.\nOur business is subject to significant government regulation.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions, the FRB and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of our operations. The bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law.\nAs a result, significant new legislation and regulatory reforms passed in the past three (3) years and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry as a whole, including our results of operations. New legislation or regulation may limit the manner in which we may conduct our business, including our ability to offer new products, assess fees, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nWe rely heavily on our management team, and the unexpected loss of key officers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects.\nOur success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to retain the services of existing senior management and, as we expand, to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management. Our senior executive officers have been instrumental in the development and management of our business. The loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects. We have not established a detailed management succession plan. Accordingly, should we lose the services of any of our senior executive officers, our Board of Directors may have to search outside of Summit Financial Group for a qualified permanent replacement. This search may be prolonged, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and hire a qualified replacement. If any of our senior executive officers leaves his or her respective position, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or future prospects may suffer.\nAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems may result in a loss of customer business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing or loan origination systems. Although we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or minimize the\neffect of a failure, interruption or breach in security of our communications or information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could result in a loss of customer business and have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe negative economic effects caused by terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, potential attacks and other destabilizing events, would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and could reduce our customer base, level of deposits and demand for our financial products, such as loans.\nHigh inflation, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, including cyber attacks, an escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences and other factors could have a negative impact on the economy of the Mid-Atlantic regions in which we operate. An additional economic downturn in our markets would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio by impacting the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and may reduce the level of deposits in our bank and the stability of our deposit funding sources. An additional economic downturn could also have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services. The cumulative effect of these matters on our results of operations and financial condition could be adverse and material.\nOur vendors could fail to fulfill their contractual obligations, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, our business and a negative impact on results of operations.\nWe have entered into subcontracts for the supply of current and future services, such as data processing, mortgage loan processing and servicing. These services must be available on a continuous and timely basis and be in compliance with any regulatory requirements. Failure to do so could substantially harm our business.\nWe often purchase services from vendors under agreements that typically can be terminated on a periodic basis. There can be no assurance, however, that vendors will be able to meet their obligations under these agreements or that we will be able to compel them to do so. Risks of relying on vendors include the following:\n\u2022\nIf an existing agreement expires or a certain service is discontinued by a vendor, then we may not be able to continue to offer our customers the same breadth of products, and our operating results would likely suffer unless we are able to find an alternate supply of a similar service.\n\u2022\nAgreements we may negotiate in the future may commit us to certain minimum spending obligations. It is possible that we will not be able to create the market demand to meet such obligations.\n\u2022\nIf market demand for our products increases suddenly, our current vendors might not be able to fulfill our commercial needs, which would require us to seek new arrangements or new sources of supply and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to control or adequately monitor the quality of services we receive from our vendors. Poor quality services could damage our reputation with our customers.\nPotential problems with vendors such as those discussed above could have a significant adverse effect on our business, lead to higher costs and damage our reputation with our customers and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setting bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards affecting the preparation of financial statements. These changes are not within our control and could materially impact our financial statements.\nOur business is dependent on technology, and our inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological\nimprovements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur potential inability to integrate companies we may acquire in the future could have a negative effect on our expenses and results of operations.\nOn occasion, we may engage in a strategic acquisition when we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand our business. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, we must integrate the administrative, financial, sales, lending, collections and marketing functions of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition, and our financial results may be negatively affected. A completed acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including our capital requirements and the accounting treatment of the acquisition. Completed acquisitions may also lead to significant unexpected liabilities after the consummation of these acquisitions.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiary bank, Summit Community. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Summit Community may pay to Summit. Also, Summit\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event Summit Community is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on either our common stock or our Series 2009 or Series 2011 preferred stock. The inability to receive dividends from Summit Community could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Such risks may include:\n\u2022\nOperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in our business or in the financial sector generally;\n\u2022\nRegulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our businesses and operations;\n\u2022\nRegulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our businesses and operations;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets, including the markets for mortgage-related securities;\n\u2022\nChanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stocks, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility;\n\u2022\nChanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of financial performance;\n\u2022\nVolatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\nRumors or erroneous information;\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nNew developments in the banking industry;\n\u2022\nVariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nNew litigation or changes in existing litigation; and\n\u2022\nRegulatory actions\nOur executive officers and directors own shares of our common stock, allowing management to have an impact on our corporate affairs.\nAs of February 24, 2015 our executive officers and directors beneficially own 24.58% (computed in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13d-3) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers and directors will be able to impact the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to our shareholders for approval, including decisions relating to the election of directors, the determination of our day-to-day corporate and management policies and other significant corporate transactions.\nYour share ownership will be diluted by the conversion of our Series 2009 and Series 2011 Preferred Stock and may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future.\nAt December 31, 2014, we have issued and outstanding 3,610 shares of our Series 2009 Preferred Stock and 11,914 shares of our Series 2011 Preferred Stock, which are convertible into 656,363 common shares and 1,489,250 common shares, respectively. Our Board of Directors has authorized the conversion of all of the Series 2009 and Series 2011 Preferred Stock to common stock on March 12, 2015, which will dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders.\nYour share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock in the future. In 1998, we adopted a stock option plan (the \u201c1998 Plan\u201d) that provided for the granting of stock options to our directors, executive officers and other employees. Although the 1998 Plan expired in May 2008, as of December 31, 2014, 149,170 shares of our common stock are still issuable under options granted in connection with our 1998 Plan. At our 2009 Annual Meeting of shareholders, a new officer stock option plan was approved, providing for 350,000 shares of common stock to be available for issuance under the plan. As of December 31, 2014, 8,000 shares of our common stock are issuable under options granted in connection with our 2009 Plan. It is probable that the stock options will be exercised during their respective terms if the fair market value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the particular option. If the stock options are exercised, your share ownership will be diluted.\nAt our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the Summit Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizing the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units granted under the plan. In addition, we have agreed to sell 1,057,137 shares of common stock (representing approximately 9.9% of our outstanding common stock) at the price of $9.75 per share to Castle Creek Capital Partners V, LP (\"Castle Creek\") in a private placement. The private placement with Castle Creek consists of two (2) closings. The first closing for the purchase of 819,384 shares of common stock at an aggregate price of $7,988,994 was consummated on November 25, 2014. The consummation of the second closing for the purchase of 237,753 shares of common stock at an aggregate price of $2,318,092 is conditioned upon, among other things, the conversion into shares of common stock of all of the outstanding shares of our 8% Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 2009 and our 8% Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 2011, in accordance with the terms of our Articles of Incorporation, as amended.\nIn addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock, but do not provide for preemptive rights to the holders of our common stock. Any authorized but unissued shares are available for issuance by our Board of Directors. As a result, if we issue additional shares of common stock to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes, you may be unable to maintain your pro rata ownership in Summit Financial Group.\nChanges in United States tax laws may have a detrimental impact on the after-tax return on investment.\nChanges in the tax law or a failure by Congress to extend or make permanent certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may adversely affect the after-tax return on investment by holders of our preferred stock or common stock. Specifically, the designation of dividends as qualified dividends currently results in a lower rate of taxation to certain taxpayers, including individuals. This provision is currently set to expire, and will no longer be available for tax years beginning after December 31, 2010. We can give no assurances that this provision will be extended or made permanent or that other detrimental changes in current tax law will not be enacted.\nThe conversion of the Series 2009 or Series 2011 preferred stock may dilute the appreciation of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock may appreciate in value, the conversion of the Series 2009 and Series 2011 preferred stock in March 2015 may dilute such appreciation. There is no guarantee that an investor in our common stock will recognize an increase in value after the impact of the conversion of the Series 2009 and Series 2011 preferred stock despite overall positive performance.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred shares without any action on the part of the shareholders. The board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred shares that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock or preferred stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur. The conversion of the Series 2009 and Series 2011 preferred stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures and our subordinated debt have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nWe have three statutory business trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable securities (the \u201ccapital securities\u201d) for which we are obligated to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities in our junior subordinated debentures (the \u201cdebentures\u201d). The debentures held by the trusts are their sole assets. Our subordinated debentures of these unconsolidated statutory trusts totaled approximately $19.6 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nDistributions on the capital securities issued by the trusts are payable quarterly, at the variable interest rates specified in those certain securities. The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the debentures.\nPayments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of the statutory trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five (5) years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock. In 2014, our total interest payments on these junior subordinated debentures approximated $514,000. Based on current rates, our quarterly interest payment obligation on our junior subordinated debentures is approximately $129,000.\nThe capital securities held by our three trust subsidiaries qualify as Tier 1 capital under FRB guidelines. In accordance with these guidelines, trust preferred securities generally are limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of Tier 1 capital elements, net of goodwill. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in Tier 2 capital.\nWe have also issued $16.8 million of subordinated debt. In 2008, $10.0 million of this debt was issued to an unaffiliated financial institution, bears a variable interest rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 275 basis points, a term of seven and one-half (7.5) years, and is not prepayable by us within the first two and one-half (2.5) years. During 2009, $5.0 million was issued to an affiliate of a director of Summit, and $1.0 million and $0.8 million was issued to two unrelated parties. These 2009 issuances bear an interest rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, a term of ten (10) years, and are not prepayable by us within the first five (5) years. In January 2015, we repaid the entire $6.8 million subordinated debt issued in 2009 and prepaid $2.5 million of the subordinated debt issued in 2008. Like the junior subordinated debentures, the subordinated debt is senior to our common stock and we must make payments on the subordinated debt before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated debt must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. The subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital under FRB guidelines, until the debt is within five (5) years of its maturity; thereafter, the amount qualifying as Tier 2 capital is reduced by twenty percent (20%) each year until maturity. Our total interest payments on this subordinated debt in 2014 were approximately $984,000. Based upon the current rate, our quarterly interest payment obligation on this debt is approximately $55,000.\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or could otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. For example, our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors. We also have a staggered board of directors, which means that only one-third (1/3) of our Board of Directors can be replaced by shareholders at any annual meeting.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated negative variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022 Negative recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 Poor operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 News reports relating to negative trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022 Negative perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022 New technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in interest rates or a lending environment with prolonged low interest rates;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in the real estate market;\n\u2022 Negative economic news;\n\u2022 Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022 Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease, regardless of operating results.\nYour shares are not an insured deposit.\nYour investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment is subject to investment risk, and you must be capable of affording the loss of your entire investment.\nOTHER RISKS\nAdditional factors could have a negative effect on our financial performance and the value of our common stock. Some of these factors are general economic and financial market conditions, continuing consolidation in the financial services industry, new litigation or changes in existing litigation, regulatory actions, and losses.", "PERMNO": 90544, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMMF"}
