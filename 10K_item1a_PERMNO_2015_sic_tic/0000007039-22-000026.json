Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global specialty petrochemicals and specialty waxes businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within our control and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or our financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Industry and Operations\nWe rely on a limited number of customers, including one customer that represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers. Our largest customer, ExxonMobil and its affiliates, represented approximately 13.4%, 15.4%, and 15.0% of our consolidated revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A significant reduction in sales to any of our key customers could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could result from our key customers further diversifying their product sourcing, experiencing financial difficulty or undergoing consolidation.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may lose market share to other producers of specialty petrochemicals, specialty waxes or other products that can be substituted for our products, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from both large international producers and from smaller regional competitors. Our competitors may improve their competitive position in our core markets by successfully introducing new products, improving their manufacturing processes or expanding their capacity or manufacturing facilities. Further, some of our competitors benefit from advantageous cost positions that could make it increasingly difficult for us to compete in certain markets. If we are unable to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 product and manufacturing process innovations, cost position or alternative value proposition, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures, alternative values or strategic goals than us. We have a portfolio of businesses across which we must allocate our available resources, while competing companies may specialize in only certain of our product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and such competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete, and competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers. We may have to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time, trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin.\nLoss of key employees, our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees or our inability to keep our employees focused on our strategies and goals could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial, technical, safety, operations, sales and marketing positions. We must also keep employees focused on our strategies and goals. The failure to hire, or loss of, key employees in a competitive industry could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. In addition, an important component of our competitive performance is our ability to operate safely and efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technological improvements, safe operations, cost control and productivity enhancements. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition.\nIf the availability of our raw materials is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand or on favorable economic terms, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe use natural gasoline as a raw material in the production our products in the Specialty Petrochemicals segment. We use polyethylene waxes in our Specialty Waxes segment. Suppliers may not be able to meet our raw material requirements and we may not be able to obtain substitute supplies from alternative suppliers in sufficient quantities, on economic terms, or in a timely manner. A lack of timely availability of our raw materials in the quantities we require to produce our products (including as a result of supply chain issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global economic issues) could result in our inability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreases in the costs of our raw materials could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if those costs cannot be passed onto our customers.\nOur results of operations are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. Since the cost of these primary raw materials comprise a significant amount of our total cost of goods sold, the selling prices for our products and therefore our total revenue is impacted by movements in these raw material costs, as well as the cost of other inputs. In the past we have experienced erratic and significant changes in the costs of these raw materials, the cost of which has generally correlated with changes in energy prices, supply and demand factors, and prices for natural gas and crude oil. Moreover, the price of raw materials may also be impacted by other external factors, including uncertainties associated with war, terrorist attacks, weather and natural disasters, health epidemics or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), civil unrest, the effects of climate change or political instability, plant or production disruptions, strikes or other labor unrest, breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used in the delivery of raw materials or changes in laws or regulations in any of the countries in which we have significant suppliers. In addition, product mix can have an impact on our overall unit selling prices, since we provide an extensive product offering and therefore experience a wide range of unit selling prices. Because of the significant portion of our cost of goods sold represented by these raw materials, our gross profit margins could be adversely affected by changes in the cost of these raw materials if we are unable to pass the increases on to our customers.\nIn addition, we utilize both formula and non-formula based pricing, depending on customer requirements and competitive situations. Under formula pricing the price charged to the customer is primarily based on a formula which includes, as a component, the average cost of feedstock over the prior month. With this pricing mechanism, product prices generally move in conjunction with feedstock prices. However, because the formulas use an average feedstock price from the prior month, the movement of product prices will trail feedstock prices, and formula prices may or may not reflect our actual feedstock cost for the month during which the product is actually sold. These timing differences have had and may, in the future, have a negative effect on our cash flow. Any raw materials cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDue to volatile raw material prices, there can be no assurance that we can continue to recover raw material costs or retain customers in the future. For example, our logistics costs have increased substantially within the past three years, narrowing our profit margins. This may force us to increase our pricing, which could cause customers to consider competitors\u2019 products, some of which may be available at a lower cost. Significant loss of customers could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to access third-party transportation for our raw materials and finished products, we may not be able to fulfill our obligations to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely upon transportation provided by third parties (including common carriers, rail companies and trans-ocean cargo companies) to receive raw materials used in the production of our products and to deliver finished products to our customers. While we attempt to offset the risks associated with third-party transportation issues, including by owning and operating a truck fleet to meet certain customer demand as well as managing our supplies of raw materials, such mitigation efforts may not be\nsuccessful. If we are unable to access third-party transportation at economically attractive rates, or at all, or if there is any other significant disruption in the availability of third-party transportation, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials (on favorable terms, or at all) to match the pace of production and/or we may not be able to fulfill our obligations to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to successfully consummate extraordinary transactions, including the integration of other businesses, assets, products or technologies, or realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any such transaction may adversely affect our future business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we from time to time explore possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures, outsourcing transactions and other business combinations (collectively, \u201cextraordinary transactions\u201d) in order to further our business objectives. To pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for, and successfully complete, extraordinary transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses or employees. The expense and effort incurred in exploring and consummating extraordinary transactions, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in additional and/or unexpected expenses and losses. We also may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential extraordinary transactions, conducting thorough due diligence, financing an extraordinary transaction or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology. Moreover, we may incur significant expenses whether or not a contemplated extraordinary transaction is ultimately consummated.\nAdditionally, in connection with any extraordinary transaction we consummate, we many not fully realize all of the anticipated synergies and other benefits we expect to achieve (on our expected timeframe, or at all), and we may incur unanticipated expenses, write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. Further, managing extraordinary transactions requires varying levels of management and employee resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. We may also face additional challenges and costs after the consummation of the transaction, including those related to integrating or restructuring our operations, information management and other technology systems, while carrying on our ongoing business.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of our facilities and the development and implementation of new manufacturing processes involve significant risks which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur facilities require periodic maintenance, upgrading, expansion, refurbishment or improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce our facilities\u2019 production capacity below expected levels which would reduce our revenues and profitability. Unanticipated expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading, expanding, refurbishing or improving our facilities may also reduce profitability.\nIf we make any major modifications to our facilities, such modifications likely would result in substantial additional capital expenditures and may prolong the time necessary to bring the facility online. We may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our facilities based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. However, such activities require time for development before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, demand growth and timing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFinally, we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Innovation in production processes involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing new process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, returns of product from customers, interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions, all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere are certain hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of diversified chemical products, our business is subject to operating risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions,\nsevere weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, loss of raw materials or our products, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, terrorist acts or war, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, our suppliers are also subject to similar risks that may adversely impact our production capabilities. A significant limitation on our ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we adapt our manufacturing and distribution processes and controls to minimize the inherent risk of our operations, to promote workplace safety and to minimize the potential for human error, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials, including injury of our employees, individuals who handle our products or goods treated with our products, or others who claim to have been exposed to our products, nor can we completely eliminate the unanticipated interruption or suspension of operations at our facilities due to such events. We may be held liable for significant damages or fines in the event of contamination or injury, and such assessed damages or fines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. Our property, business interruption and casualty insurance may not fully insure us against all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nConditions in the global economy may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe demand for our products have historically correlated closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest, weather and national disasters or health epidemics and pandemics also impact the demand for our products. Economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and financial institutions also pose risks to us, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to us.\nIn addition, the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically been subject to fluctuation, which makes future financial results less predictable. Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products, customer groups and geographic markets. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net revenue. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures. Market trends, competitive pressures, increased raw material or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has the potential to result in higher interest rates and capital costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, increases in the costs of feedstocks, labor, materials, and other inputs. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains, if these measures are not effective our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred. Additionally, the pricing actions we take could result in a decrease in market share.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Company and/or its customers, suppliers, and other counterparties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity, particularly, reduced demand in durable goods markets such as automotive and construction, disruptions in global supply chains, significant economic uncertainty and volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. Across all of our businesses, we are facing increased operational challenges from the continued need to protect employee health and safety by requiring restrictions on the movement of people, which can cause workplace disruptions, reduced productivity, operational disruptions or shutdowns, and the incurrence of additional costs. Due to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also experiencing, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services from our customers, as well as potential restrictions or delays on deliveries of key raw materials from our suppliers. See Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information on how we have been impacted and the steps we have taken in response.\nBecause the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict (including as a result of the emergence of the new variants such as Delta and Omicron), the pandemic\u2019s impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and human capital constraints); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; the weakening of demand in certain end markets; prolonged disruption in global logistics channels; inflationary pressure on on cost of good sold and global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. We expect that the longer the period of economic and global supply chain and disruption continues, the more material the impact could be on our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, and this could include potential charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts in future periods.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors herein, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us.\nDomestic or international natural disasters or other severe weather events, health epidemics or pandemics or terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, decrease demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business.\nChemical related assets, and U.S. corporations such as ours, may be at a greater risk of future terrorist attacks (including both physical attacks and cyber-attacks) than other possible targets in the U.S. Moreover, extraordinary events such as natural disasters, other severe weather events (such as the prolonged period of sub-freezing temperatures and snow across the State of Texas and the region in February 2021 (the \u201cTexas freeze event\u201d)) or global or local health epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) could result in significant damage to our facilities, the pipeline systems and other infrastructure we rely on and/or disruption of our operations and may negatively affect local economies, including those of our customers or suppliers. The occurrence of such events cannot be predicted, although their occurrence can be expected to continue to adversely impact the economy in general and our specific markets.\nThe resulting damage from a natural disaster, other severe weather events or terrorist attack could include loss of life, property damage or site closure. Several of our facilities are located in regions where natural disasters and other severe weather events have previously disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our ability to manufacture and deliver products from certain facilities. Any damage resulting in stoppage or reduction of our facilities\u2019 production capacity could reduce our revenues and any unanticipated capital expenditures to repair such damage (to the extent not covered by our insurance policies) may reduce profitability. Any, or a combination, of these factors could also adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not have production operations and assets outside of the U.S., we do have a global portfolio of customers and thus we are subject to a variety of international market risks including, but not limited to: ongoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, civil unrest and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability or credit risk among customers and distributors; trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, including domestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers; regulations favoring local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a local jurisdiction; local labor conditions and regulations and the geographical dispersion of the workforce; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; differing technology standards or customer requirements; import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for labor and raw materials or lead to penalties or restrictions; data privacy regulations; risk of non-compliance with the sanction laws or U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery legislation in other countries by agents or other third-party representatives; risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments; foreign currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations; the outbreak of global or regional health epidemics or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nSuch economic and political uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive raw materials from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. We are also predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.\nOur business, operating results and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist stockholders.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. Our board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our board of directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with the Company\u2019s stockholders will be successful. Activist stockholders who disagree with our operations, including the composition of our board of directors, our management team or the Company\u2019s strategic direction, may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by our board of directors and litigation.\nIf faced with a proxy contest or other stockholder action or request, we may not be able or willing to respond successfully to the contest, action, or request, which could be significantly disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business and operations could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or activist stockholder action or request because:\n\u2022responding to proxy contests and other actions or requests by activist stockholders, including responding to, or initiating, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from a proxy contest, can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to uncertainty among employees, customers, suppliers and investors about the strategic direction of our business;\n\u2022perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business may make it more difficult to attract and retain customers and skilled employees; and\n\u2022if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our stockholders.\nIn 2021 and early 2022, we engaged in extensive dialogues with certain activist stockholders. In February 2022, we received notice from Pangaea Ventures, L.P. (\u201cPangaea\u201d) of its intent to nominate six directors to our board of directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of continued action by Pangaea or further actions by other activist stockholders, which could serve as a distraction to our board of directors, management team and employees and could require us to incur additional costs. Additionally, there can be no assurance that Pangaea or a third party will not pursue litigation and no assurance that if the six persons proposed by Pangaea for election at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders are elected, which would constitute a change to a majority of our board of directors, they will not attempt to effect changes to our operations, including to our management team or the strategic direction of our business.\nAny activist stockholder contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist stockholders among our stockholder base, could cause the market price for our common stock to experience periods of significant volatility based on temporary or speculative market perceptions that do not necessarily reflect our business operations.\nDelaware law and certain provisions of our organizational documents may make a takeover of our company more difficult.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company. A change of control could be proposed in the form of a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. For example, our charter and bylaws: require that the number of directors be determined, and provide that any vacancy or new board seat may be filled only by the board; do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur employment agreements and equity arrangements with our executive officers also contain change in control provisions. Under the terms of these arrangements, the executive officers may be entitled to receive significant cash payments and immediate vesting of equity awards in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances in connection with or in certain circumstances following, a \u201ccorporate change\u201d. We disclose in proxy statements filed with the SEC potential payments to our named executive officers in connection with such \u201ccorporate change.\u201d Certain change of control transactions may also constitute an event of default under our agreements with our creditors and other third parties.\nThese arrangements and provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management of our company, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for our stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to numerous regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe operate in a highly-regulated industry and are subject to numerous regulations, including customs and international trade laws, export control, data privacy, antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of our facilities, and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. If these laws or regulations were to change (including as a result of policies that may be adopted by the Biden administration, consistent with its stated environmental policy objectives) or were violated by our management, employees, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and hurt our business and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, we face risk associated with trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements. Finally, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nLegal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effects on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business, including legal proceedings brought in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nWe expect to continue to incur capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.\nOur industry is subject to extensive laws and evolving regulations related to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations have tended to become more stringent over time, continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things: the discharge of pollutants into the environment; emissions into the atmosphere (including greenhouse gas emissions); and restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We are also subject to laws and regulations that require us to operate and maintain our facilities to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nWhile we are committed to full compliance with all environmental legal requirements, failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or failure to obtain required permits from applicable regulatory authorities, may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in operations. To the extent these capital expenditures or operating costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, or that we are subject to fines, penalties or other interruptions in our operations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our products.\nAs a business in the fossil fuel industry, the nature of our operations could make us subject to legislation or regulations affecting the emission of greenhouse gases. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated (and may in the future promulgate) regulations applicable to projects involving greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold, and the U.S. and certain states within the U.S. have enacted, or are considering, limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Such policies are currently being considered by the Biden administration, which has made the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and reduced dependence on fossil fuel consumption, central policy concerns. Jurisdictions outside the U.S. are also addressing greenhouse gases by legislation or regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made at the international level toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global greenhouse gas emissions. These limitations may\ninclude the adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, in January 2021, President Biden signed executive orders that represent his administrations first actions to fight climate change, which included an executive order to reenter the Paris Agreement international treaty on climate change that requires member countries to review and progress their intended contributions and set greenhouse gas reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The implementation of this treaty and other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources. Such legislation, regulation, treaties or protocols may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\nRisks Related to Technology\nIncreased information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nIncreased information systems security threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data, operations, and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including security measures, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, upgrading our equipment and software and maintenance of backup and protective systems, if these measures prove inadequate, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary and confidential information, and communications or customer data, having our business operations interrupted, our supply chain interrupted and increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate these cyber security threats. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause customers to cancel orders, result in us being unable to manufacture or deliver products (or cause delays), harm our reputation or cause standard business processes to become inefficient or ineffective, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to continue the technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur industry and the markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In addition, our customers may introduce new generations of their own products, adopt new or different risk profiles, or require new technological and increased performance specifications that would require us to develop customized products. Our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain or enhance technological capabilities, develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer requirements and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our inability to maintain a technological edge, innovate and improve our products could cause a decline in the demand and sales of our products and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA failure of our information technology systems, including our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, could adversely effect on our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or similar events. For example, in 2017 we implemented a new ERP system at our specialty petrochemicals facility in order to better manage our business, and we continue to implement additional improvements to the system. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities over a significant period of time. A failure or prolonged interruption in our information technology systems, including our ERP system, or difficulties encountered in upgrading our systems or implementing new systems that compromises our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs or impairs our ability to record, process and report accurate information, could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting (including our disclosure controls and procedures), and our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financing and Tax\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.\nFactors that could materially affect our future effective tax rates include but are not limited to: changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment; changes in accounting and tax standards or practices; changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction; and our operating results before taxes.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related\nlitigation could be materially different to that which is reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Should any tax authority take issue with our estimates, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities. While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to, among other things: incur indebtedness and liens; make loans and investments; prepay, redeem or repurchase debt; engage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions; change our business; amend some of our debt agreements; and grant negative pledges to other creditors.\nIn addition, the ARC Agreement (as defined herein) also has financial covenants that require TOCCO to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the ARC Agreement). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements. Further, an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one instrument may constitute an event of default under another instrument. If any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d) and $42.2 million in borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\" and, together with the Revolving Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cARC Agreement\u201d) governing the Credit Facilities, we also have the option, at any time, to request an increase to the commitment under the Revolving Facility and/or the Term Loan Facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lenders acceptance of the increased commitment and other conditions.\nAlthough the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and additional indebtedness that we may incur from time to time to finance projects or for other reasons in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nFor example, in May 2020, SHR and TC received loan proceeds in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.1 million under the Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP Loans\u201d) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) and administered by the United States Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). The PPP Loans were eligible for partial or full forgiveness if we complied with the provisions of the CARES Act. In the second half of 2021, the Company was notified of full forgiveness for the PPP Loans, including all accrued interest to the applicable date of forgiveness. Although the PPP Loans have been forgiven in full, the SBA reserves the right to audit any loan under the Paycheck Protection Program and these audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. In accordance with the CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their PPP loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in full and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request. If the SBA were to conduct an audit of the PPP Loans, there can be no guarantee that the results will be favorable in determining that SHR and TC were eligible for full forgiveness of the PPP Loans.\nOur current, or any future, indebtedness could: limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness; limit our ability to reinvest in our business; render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to maintain our operating performance, which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations.\nTo service our current, and any future, indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may adversely affect our future results.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness (or otherwise seek amendment or relief from the terms of our indebtedness), on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We might not generate sufficient cash flow to repay indebtedness as currently anticipated. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities are, and additional borrowings in the future may be, at variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may in the future enter into, interest rate swaps for our variable rate debt whereby we exchange floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility. However, any interest rate swaps into which we enter may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, our variable rate indebtedness may use the London Interbank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The LIBOR has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (the \u201cLIBOR Announcement\u201d).\nThese reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although on July 29, 2021, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a U.S.-based group convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, formally recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred replacement rate for LIBOR. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments, or whether the COVID-19 pandemic will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. In addition, SOFR or other replacement rates may fail to gain market acceptance. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market value of and/or transferability of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations.\nUS dollar borrowings under the Credit Facilities currently bear interest at variable interest rates that use LIBOR. No modification has been made yet to the Credit Facilities as it pertains to US dollar borrowings as a result of the LIBOR Announcement, though changes will be required in the future. Currently, it is anticipated that the new benchmark for our US dollar borrowings will be one or more SOFR-based rates. The shift to SOFR from LIBOR is complex and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition liquidity and cash flows. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in our financing costs and our ability to access capital. We do not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.", "PERMNO": 14761, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "TREC"}
