RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information on the risks we face and our Management of risk contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings, the following are material risks which may affect us. Events or circumstances arising from one or more of these risks could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and prospects-and the value and price of our common stock could decline. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks we face, and additional risks that we may currently view as not material may also impair our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nReaders and prospective investors in our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nCOVID-19 RELATED RISKS\nThe effects of widespread public health emergencies such as the outbreak of COVID-19, has negatively affected the U.S. economy and will likely negatively affect our local economies and may disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWidespread health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China, U.S. and other countries, may disrupt our operations through their impact on our employees, customers and their businesses, and certain industries in which our customers operate. Disruptions to our customers may impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to the Company and result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, declining collateral values associated with our existing loans, and losses on our loans. Further, the spread of the outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may likely disrupt banking and other financial activity in the areas in which the Company operates. This would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and services, including loans and deposits which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nAdditional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:\n\u2022employees contracting COVID-19;\n\u2022a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;\n\u2022unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\n\u2022declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;\n\u2022reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;\n\u2022volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio;\n\u2022decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our allowance for loan losses;\n\u2022declines in value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral;\n\u2022declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022difficult economic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, including changes to the commercial real estate market where we have a concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate;\n\u2022disruptions in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect our business;\n\u2022we could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services;\n\u2022deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future;\n\u2022our allowance for loan loss may not be adequate to cover actual losses;\n\u2022the repayment of our income property loans, consisting of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers;\n\u2022we are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and litigation, regulatory or other enforcement proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences;\n\u2022we compete against larger banks and other institutions who may have more resources to absorb some of the costs adverse effects of COVID19; or\n\u2022we may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on, or repurchase, our common stock.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employee\u2019s ability to provide customer support and service. If we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could further adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nConcern about the spread of COVID-19 has caused and is likely to continue to cause business disruptions which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments.\nCurrently, COVID-19 is continuing to spread through the United States and the world. The resulting concerns on the part of the U.S. and global populations have created the threat of a recession and reduced economic activity. Certain of our borrowers are in or have exposure to the various industries impacted by COVID-19 and/or are located in areas that are quarantined or under stay-at-home orders. A prolonged quarantine or stay-at-home order would have a negative adverse impact on these borrowers and their revenue streams, which consequently impacts their ability to meet their financial obligations and could result in loan defaults.\nFurther, our risks of timely loan repayment and the value of collateral supporting the loans are affected by the strength of our borrower\u2019s business. Concern about the spread of COVID-19 has caused and is likely to continue to cause business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments, and overall economic and financial market instability, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. If the effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our loan portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. In addition, we have unfunded commitments to extend credit to customers. During a challenging\neconomic environment like now, our customers are more dependent on our credit commitments and increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe volatility in the global capital markets resulting from the pandemic and related business conditions may restrict our access to capital and/or increase our cost of capital.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including employees, customers, and business partners) to assess, address and mitigate the impact of this global pandemic. However, we cannot predict the length and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time.\nWe rely upon third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our customers. Furthermore, the outbreak could negatively impact the ability of our employees and customers to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which we operate and could create widespread issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of a COVID-19 outbreak in our market areas. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective. We believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on our business and could result in increased losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would impact our earnings and capital.\nThere are significant operational risks associated with modified work programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and regulatory responses thereto.\nWe rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information technology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. In response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with over 60% of our employees working remotely from their homes to have our operations uninterrupted as much as possible. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nMoreover, we rely on many third parties in our business operations, including appraisers of real property collateral, vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems and analytical tools and providers of electronic payment and settlement systems, and local and federal government agencies, offices, and courthouses. In light of the developing measures responding to the pandemic, many of these entities may limit the availability and access of their services. If the third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our operations.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19 and governmental and regulatory responses thereto.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent and expects to maintain this target range until it is confident the economy is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy sector. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nMARKET RISKS\nDifficult economic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry.\nOur financial performance, and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on, and repay the principal of, outstanding loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in\nthe markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Economic pressures on consumers and businesses may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price. In particular, our banking operations are concentrated primarily in Southern California. Deterioration of economic conditions in Southern California could impair the ability of our borrowers to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, and erode the value of loan collateral. These conditions could increase the amount of our non-performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non-performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non-performing assets (including other real estate owned) on terms favorable to us, if at all. These conditions could also cause a decline in demand for our products and services, a lack of growth, or a decrease in deposits, any of which may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital, and hurt our business.\nWe have a niche in the hospitality industry which has been materially affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt December 31, 2020, our total loan commitments to the hospitality industry was $241.2 million, of which $212.3 million was outstanding, representing 11.2% of total loans including loans held for sale, and loans held for investment net of discount and deferred fees. We originated $25.8 million hospitality PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA. We also originated four loans to the hospitality industry under the Main Street Lending Program in a principal amount totaling $14.4 million and sold 95% participation interests totaling $13.7 million to the SPV reducing the Company's net exposure to $700 thousand at December 31, 2020. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality business segment are unprecedented with global demand for lodging, food and travel drastically reduced and, for many borrowers in lodging, occupancy levels reaching historic lows. As a result, revenues of our borrowers heavily involved in this industry segment have declined significantly and this trend may continue which could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers within the hospitality industry to make payments on their loans when due, impair the value of the collateral securing their loans to us, and/or reduce demand from this industry segment for our products and services, any of which individually, or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates which could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential, or \u201cspread,\u201d between the interest earned on loans, investment securities, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and deposit-taking activities is a material market risk to us and our business. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates. The magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates, events over which we have no control, may have an adverse effect on net interest income. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels, which are also impacted by the decreases in interest rates, can materially affect our assets and liabilities. On the contrary, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations, which could in turn lead to an increase in non-performing assets and net charge-offs.\nGenerally, the interest rates on our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate, to the same extent, or on the same basis. Even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of re-pricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. We seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset-liability composition to obtain the maximum spread. We use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in managing asset-liability composition. However, such management tools have inherent limitations that may impair their effectiveness.\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, in May 2018 a group of selected large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee or ARRC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, given the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Furthermore, the Bank of England has commenced publication of a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average or SONIA, comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling money market transactions, as of April 23, 2018. The SONIA has been recommended as the alternative to Sterling LIBOR by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR and SONIA will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR or SONIA, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally\n\u2022adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities\n\u2022require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR or reformed SONIA\nAlthough the manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain, because we do not have a material amount of LIBOR-based products and our credit documentation provides for the flexibility to move to alternative reference rates, our Management does not believe that the discontinuation of LIBOR will have any material adverse impact on the Company.\nDisruptions in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWhile overall the U.S. economy has experienced a prolonged low interest rate environment, the Southern California real estate market has recovered from what had been a substantial decline during the prior recession. On December 31, 2020, 37.7% and 10.5% of our total loans held for investment, net, were comprised of commercial real estate and construction loans, respectively. Of the commercial real estate loans, 29.1% was non-owner-occupied. Because a significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate, any new downturn in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect our business. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would likely experience greater exposure to risk of loss on loans.\nGENERAL BUSINESS RISKS\nOur clients could move their money to alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding.\nDemand deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts offered by other out-of-area financial institutions or non-bank service providers. When clients move money out of Bank demand deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits, we lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income.\nSeveral rating agencies publish unsolicited ratings of the financial performance and relative financial health of many banks, including our Bank, based on publicly available data. As these ratings are publicly available, a decline in our ratings may result in deposit outflows or the inability of our Bank to raise deposits in the secondary market as broker-dealers and depositors may use such ratings in deciding where to deposit their funds.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASU 2016-13\") also known as CECL. CECL will result in earlier recognition of credit losses and requires consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will be required to comply with the new standard on January 1, 2023. The Company is considering early adoption of ASU 2016-13. In December 2018, the regulatory agencies approved a final rule that provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to errors, financial misstatements, or operational losses. The Company\nhas not yet determined the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will have insufficient cash or access to cash to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. We mitigate liquidity risk by establishing and accessing lines of credit with various financial institutions and having back-up access to the brokered deposit markets. Results of operations could be affected if we were unable to satisfy current or future financial obligations. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented.\nOur Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls, procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, and consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We have also experienced an increase in malicious attempts, although, to our knowledge, none of these attempts have resulted in any material loss. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, and certain of our third-party partners, such as our internet-based services to our clients, including mobile and online banking services either directly or through an arrangement with a service bureau or third-party or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches, and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees.\nFurthermore, our cardholders use their debit and commercial credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third-party processing services. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third party\u2019s information systems or their payment processors. Such a data security breach could compromise our account information. We may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions, as well as for other costs related to data security breaches.\nIn addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems), or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes, and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients, and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches (including cybersecurity breaches) could limit the growth of our technology-driven products and services.\nWe offer various internet-based services to our clients, including mobile and online banking services either directly or through an arrangement with a service bureau or third party. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence in our mobile and online services. In certain cases, we are responsible for protecting customers\u2019 proprietary information as well as their accounts with us. We have security measures and processes in place to defend against these cybersecurity risks but these cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving (including computer viruses, malicious code, phishing or other information security breaches), and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, which could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. In addition, individuals, groups or sovereign countries may seek to intentionally disrupt our online banking services or compromise the confidentiality of customer information with criminal intent. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to recognize and assist in preventing security breaches (and periodically test our security), failure to protect against or mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our technology-driven products and services, constitute a breach of privacy or other laws, result in costly litigation and loss of customer relationships, negatively impact our reputation, and could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. The Company holds various insurance policies including cybersecurity insurance, however we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of breaches and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches of security. We may also incur substantial increases in costs in an effort to minimize or mitigate cyber security risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors, and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable, illegal, or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place that seek to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors, and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues, and increased governmental regulation.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating, and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating, and financial control systems technology, including customer relationship management, internet banking, website, general ledger, deposit, loan servicing, and wire origination systems. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could\nresult in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, internet banking, website, general ledger, deposit, loan servicing, and/or wire origination systems. We cannot assure you that such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational, or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of our vendors\u2019 performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems, or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. In addition, we continue to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the growth and successful operation of our business. If for any reason we are unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nCREDIT RISKS\nDeteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future.\nWhen we lend money or commit to lend money, we incur credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans or other credit obligations. The performance of these loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which could result in a higher level of loan losses and allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\"). We reserve for loan losses by establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of these reserves is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolios including unfunded credit commitments. The process for determining the amount of the ALLL, and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about the environment, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nOur Management might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our portfolios and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower\u2019s behavior or changing protections in credit agreements. As an example, borrowers may \u201cstrategically default,\u201d or discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments. We believe that both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at December 31, 2020; however, there is no assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future loan losses, especially if the commercial real estate market and employment conditions experience a decline. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce earnings. For more information, refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Potential Problem Loans.\nOur allowance for loan loss may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nWe maintain an ALLL on loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents Management\u2019s best estimate of risk of losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects Management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; historical loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALLL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires our Management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.\nDeterioration in economic conditions and pandemic events such as COVID-19 affecting our borrowers and collateral, new information regarding existing loans, identification of problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ALLL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ALLL and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our Management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALLL, we will need additional provisions to increase the ALLL. Any increases in the ALLL will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for Loan Losses for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the ALLL.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices.\nWe mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to sound and proven underwriting practices, managed by experienced and knowledgeable credit professionals. These practices include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns, cash flow projections, valuations of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers, and verifications of liquid assets. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria is appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ALLL.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, or other climate change-related matters could significantly affect our business especially for loans secured by commercial real estate.\nOur primary market is located in an earthquake-prone zone in Southern California, which is also subject to other weather or disasters, such as severe wildfire, earthquakes, drought, or flood. These events could unexpectedly interrupt our business operations. Climate-related physical changes and hazards (e.g. properties in coastal areas have higher risk of rising sea level and erosions or damages to the properties (e.g. tsunamis, landslides, floods, etc.) could also pose credit risks for us. A number of factors can affect credit losses, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent of damage not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure to us. Lastly, there could be increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, due to severe weather-related losses. The ultimate outcome on our business of a natural disaster, whether or not caused by climate change, is difficult to predict.\nOur concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate (including owner-occupied nonresidential properties, other nonresidential properties, construction, land development and other land, and multifamily residential properties) has increased from 441% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2019 to 456% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020. While our risk management practices are designed to closely monitor these loans as well as the market conditions, and analyze the impact of various stress scenarios on these loans, it is possible that an adverse change in the Southern California commercial real estate market could result in loan losses or the need to increase reserves or capital costs which could have a negative impact on consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations, capital, prospects, or reputation.\nThe repayment of our income property loans, consisting of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWe originate non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. Repayment of these loans is often dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions.\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate loans also expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate,\nare not fully amortized with large balloon payments upon maturity, and have a longer holding period for the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis. As of December 31, 2020, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $550.8 million or 29.1% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts.\nReal estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nThe risks inherent in real estate construction loans may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. Such risks include, among other things, (i) the possibility that contractors may fail to complete, or complete on an untimely basis, construction of the relevant properties; (ii) substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing are incurred; (iii) market deterioration occurs during construction; and (iv) a lack of permanent take-out financing arises. Loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because they have no operating history. The costs may exceed a project's realizable value in a declining real estate market and such properties may not be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower. Real estate construction loans, including land development loans, comprised approximately 10.5% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts, as of December 31, 2020.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it. A general decline in real estate sales and prices across the United States or locally in the relevant real estate market, a decline in demand for commercial real estate loans, economic weakness, high rates of unemployment, and reduced availability of mortgage credit, are some of the factors that can adversely affect the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral, and thereby adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nSupervisory guidance on commercial real estate concentrations could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limits on the conduct of our business.\nThe Federal Regulatory Agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities. There have been concerns about commercial real estate lending and underwriting expressed by the agencies along with historical concerns that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets. Existing guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit banks\u2019 commercial real estate lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. Our lending and risk management practices will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy. The regulatory definition of a commercial real estate concentration excludes owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, but includes unsecured commercial and industrial loans for the purpose of real estate that are not secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial real estate concentration exceeded the regulatory guideline (as defined by the federal bank regulators) of 300% of total risk-based capital and exceeded 50% growth of our commercial real estate related loans over the past 36 months due primarily to the PCB acquisition. Our internal policy is to limit our commercial real estate concentration to 350% of total risk-based capital. Our commercial real estate concentration, as defined by regulatory guidance, was 308% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, as compared to 314% at December 31, 2019. In addition, the federal bank regulators established a guideline of 100% of total risk-based capital for loans secured by commercial real estate construction and land development loans. Our internal policy is to limit these loans to 150% of total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total loans secured by commercial real estate under construction and land development represented 94% and 125% of total risk-based capital. If our risk management\npractices with regard to this portion of our portfolio are found to be deficient, it could result in increased reserves and capital costs or a need to reduce this type of lending which could negatively impact earnings.\nRepayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default.\nWe make our commercial and industrial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Collateral securing commercial and industrial loans are generally the working assets of a business that fluctuate in value, may depreciate over time, and could be difficult to appraise. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial and industrial loans totaled $388.8 million, or 20.5% of our total loans held for investment, net of discounts.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and litigation, regulatory or other enforcement proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.\nWe are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding our customers and businesses, as well as our sales practices, data security, product offerings, compensation practices, and other compliance issues. In addition, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S. means that a single event or topic may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings which may result in material adverse consequences. These potential consequences include without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of our SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, responding to information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, could be time-consuming and expensive.\nLike other financial institutions and companies, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against our Company could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm to our business. The outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties. For further information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings, please refer to Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nSignificant changes in banking laws or regulations and federal monetary policy could materially affect our business.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and significant new laws and regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws and regulations, and the manner in which the changes are applied may cause results to differ materially. Also, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and bank reserve requirements. A material change in these conditions would affect our results. For further discussion of the regulation of financial services, please refer to Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation and Supervision.\nWe may incur fines, penalties, and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, which are possibly even for inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. We may incur fines, penalties, and other negative consequences from\nregulatory violations. We may suffer other negative consequences resulting from findings of noncompliance with laws and regulations, which may also damage our reputation, and this in turn might materially affect our business and results of operations.\nFor example, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, imposes upon the Company a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of our entire community, and requires our federal banking regulators to evaluate the Company\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of our communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and to take that record into account in their evaluation of certain regulatory applications, such as applications for mergers, consolidations and acquisitions or the Company\u2019s engagement in certain activities pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the \u201cGLB\u201d). An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying such application. Accordingly, a determination that our policies, procedures and systems are deficient under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 or our record of meeting the credit needs of our entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, is less than satisfactory could materially limit our ability to, or otherwise prevent us from, engaging in any expansion activities or any other activities contemplated in our strategic plan. Further, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional, and even though systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance were in place at the time.\nWe are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations as well as contractual privacy and data protection obligations. Our failure to comply with these or any future laws, regulations, or obligations could subject us to sanctions and damages, and could harm our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies and state and local agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our current and prospective customers in the course of offering and/or providing financial products, services, and our employees. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies, and other legal obligations may apply to our collection, distribution, use, security, or storage of personally identifiable information or other data relating to individuals. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, or our internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations-or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees, and others may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, and penalties or adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. In particular, California\u2019s recently enacted privacy laws, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, give consumers significant rights over the use of their personal information and provides a private right of action for security breaches. Any new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations, or other standards may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations, especially since different jurisdictions may have enacted different laws with varying compliance obligations.\nLiabilities from environmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages, and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nSTRATEGY RISKS\nWe have a continuing need to adapt to technological changes.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology allows us to potentially serve our customers better, increase our operating efficiency by reducing operating costs, provide a wider range of products and services to our customers, and potentially attract new customers. Our future success will partially depend upon our ability to successfully leverage technology to provide products and services that will satisfy our customers\u2019 demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operating efficiencies while still maintaining appropriate fraud and cyber-security controls. Our larger competitors already have existing infrastructures or substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We generally arrange for such services through service bureau arrangements or other arrangements with third parties.\nSBA lending is subject to government funding, which can be limited or uncertain.\nThe Bank engages in SBA lending through programs designed by the federal government to assist the small business community in obtaining financing from financial institutions that are given government guarantees as an incentive to make the loans. SBA lending is subject to federal legislation that can affect the availability and funding of the program. From time to time, this dependence on legislative funding causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such programs, which could potentially have an adverse financial impact on our business.\nWe compete against larger banks and other institutions.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits and loans in our marketplace. Competition for deposits primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, thrift and loan associations, money market and mutual funds, and other investment alternatives. Competition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, thrift and loan associations, and other financial intermediaries. Our larger competitors, by virtue of their larger capital resources, have substantially greater lending limits than we have. They also provide certain services for their customers, including trust, wealth management, and international banking, which we only are able to offer indirectly through our correspondent relationships. In addition, they have greater resources and are able to offer longer maturities and on occasion, lower rates on fixed rate loans as well as more aggressive underwriting.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to: not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and to obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. To the extent we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in this Annual Report and future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThere is a risk that we may be dropped from inclusion in the Russell 2000 Index which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nAlthough we are currently included in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index, there is a risk that we could be dropped from inclusion when the list of public companies included in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index is reconstituted in May 2021 which could result in a decline in demand for our common stock and, accordingly, the trading price of our common stock following such event. Investment banks have estimated that the market capitalization cutoff for the Russell 2000 index would be increased to roughly $245 million from about $95 million due to recent strong small-cap performance, special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, activity, strong IPO activity and the depressed mergers and acquisitions environment in 2020. Our market capitalization fluctuates based on the market price of our common stock and, between March 1, 2021 and March 12, 2021, our market capitalization fluctuated between a low of $245 million and a high of $288 million based on the lowest closing price of $20.72 per share and the highest closing price of $24.33 per share during this period.\nOur accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. They require Management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of our accounting policies are critical because they require Management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements, including the allowance for loan losses, valuation of acquired loans, the valuation of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the valuation of deferred tax assets, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require Management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, and contingencies. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust our accounting policies or consolidated financial statements. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, may experience significant volatility based on its history. The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our consolidated financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales of our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified in the \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation. Among the factors that could affect our stock price, certain of which are beyond our control, are:\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations;\n\u2022publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022failure to continue our common stock repurchase program or payment of dividends;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings actions by institutional shareholders;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022political events, elections, or changes in government or administration;\n\u2022proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us\n\u2022deletion from a well-known index; and\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThere are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to our holding company, in particular, federal and state banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank without prior approval.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk-based capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies. The final Basel III capital standards issued in 2013 by the Federal Reserve provide that distributions (including dividend payments and redemptions) on additional Tier 1 capital instruments may only be paid out of net income, retained earnings, or surplus related to other additional Tier 1 capital instruments. The final Basel III capital standards also introduced a new capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Failure to maintain a capital conservation buffer above certain levels will result in restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, make dividend payments, redemptions, or other capital distributions. These\nrequirements, and any other new regulations or capital distribution constraints, could adversely affect the ability of our Bank to pay dividends to our holding company and, in turn, affect our holding company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. In addition, the Federal Reserve may also, as a supervisory matter, otherwise limit our holding company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe elected into the CBLR, framework, beginning with our regulatory report filed for the first quarter of 2020. Under the CBLR framework, if the Bank maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, it will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements of the capital rules of its federal bank regulator and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Even though the Bank meets the above-stated criteria, its federal banking regulators have reserved the authority to disallow the use of the CBLR framework based on the risk profile of the banking organization.\nOn April 6, 2020, the federal banking regulators, implementing the applicable provisions of the CARES Act, issued interim rules which modified the CBLR framework so that: (i) beginning in the second quarter 2020 and until the end of 2020, a banking organization that has a leverage ratio of 8% or greater and meets certain other criteria may elect to use the CBLR framework; and (ii) community banking organizations will have until January 1, 2022, before the CBLR requirement is reestablished at greater than 9%. Under the interim rules, the minimum CBLR is 8% beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9% thereafter. The interim rules also maintain a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 1% below the applicable community bank leverage ratio.\nThe Bank\u2019s failure to maintain the minimum leverage ratio under the CBLR framework will result in our Bank having to comply with the generally applicable capital rules, including the capital conservation buffer requirements thereof at which time, the failure to maintain this capital conservation buffer above certain levels will result in restrictions on our ability to make dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.\nPayment of stock or cash dividends on our common stock depends on a multitude of factors, including but not limited to: (a) our holding company may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to it by our Bank, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of our Bank to pay dividends; (b) Federal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and consolidated financial condition; or (c) our Board of Directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy. If we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event our Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to our holding company, our holding company may not be able to service our debt, pay our other obligations, continue repurchasing our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our holding company\u2019s inability to receive dividends from our Bank could also have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and the value of our common stock.\nOur stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of our common stock are listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the average daily trading volume in the common stock varies and may be less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time,-or the expectation of these sales-could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17798, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCBP"}
