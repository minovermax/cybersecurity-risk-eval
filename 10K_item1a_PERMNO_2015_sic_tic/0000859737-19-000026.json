Risk Factors\nIn evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements; please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe continuing worldwide macroeconomic and political uncertainty, as well as existing tariffs and trade wars, may adversely affect our business and prospects, both domestically and internationally.\nContinued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply.\nMarket acceptance of our medical products in the U.S. and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient need for our products and procedures, the reimbursement of patients\u2019 medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions and financial markets may cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities. Economic uncertainty as well as increasing health insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles may continue to result in cost-conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists, which in turn would adversely affect demand for our products and procedures. Furthermore, governments and other third-party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered, which could adversely affect sales of our products. Also, the elective nature of the Medical Aesthetics procedures subjects our business to increased volatility due to macroeconomic conditions.\nChanges in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. In 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impending exit of the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d), has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU. Until the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU are determined, including any transition period, it is difficult to predict its impact. For example, as a result of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges. We have a manufacturing facility in the UK, and, depending on the terms of Brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in Europe. We have increased inventories of certain products and components in anticipation of Brexit, which has impacted our financial results. Additionally, Brexit could result in the UK or the EU significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the UK. Any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal may affect us.\nOur international sales are often denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, UK Pound and Renminbi. Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the increase in the value of the dollar against any such foreign currencies, may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the U.S and associated cash flows and our ability to compete effectively in foreign markets. In addition, such fluctuations can also result in foreign currency exchange losses. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes. We currently have limited hedging arrangements in place to mitigate some of the impact of negative exchange rates.\nThere is also uncertainty surrounding U.S. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 and the impact on existing and future healthcare legislation. While we cannot predict the outcome of the elections or any resulting legislative changes, such changes could have a material impact on our business.\nOur long-term success will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products, enhance our existing products and integrate acquired businesses.\nThe markets for our products have been characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. Our growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for or enhancements of existing products, either through internal research and development or through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties.\nThe development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory clearances and approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain, maintain, protect and enforce appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, gain and maintain market approval of our products and access capital. If we are not able to successfully enhance existing products or develop new products, our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology. We cannot assure that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance, and we may be unable to recover all or a meaningful part of our investment in such products and technologies.\nAdditionally, as part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities to further expand our presence in or diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once we acquire a business, any inability to successfully integrate the business, decreases in customer loyalty or product orders, failure to retain and develop the acquired workforce, failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls or unknown or contingent liabilities could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. The integration of an acquired business whether or not successful, requires significant efforts which may result in additional expenses and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from other projects. These transactions are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any past or future transaction will be successful. For example, we were unable to achieve our anticipated benefits and results following our acquisition of Cynosure (our Medical Aesthetics business), and as a result, we recorded impairment charges in excess of $1.4 billion, in the aggregate, in fiscal 2018 and 2019.\nIf we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or other obligations, or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could be adversely affected, and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete.\nIf we fail to develop, successfully manufacture and launch new products, enhance existing products or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses and products, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory and quality requirements, our ability to sell our products and our business will be harmed.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities. These difficulties have primarily related to delays and difficulties associated with ramping up production of newly introduced products and may result in increased delivery lead-times and increased costs of manufacturing these products. In addition, production of these newer products may require the development of new manufacturing technologies and expertise, which we may be unable to develop. Our failure, including the failure of our contract manufacturers, to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals, increased warranty costs or other problems that could harm our business and prospects.\nIn determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors\n(including the anticipation of Brexit). There could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we and our distributors require, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, maintaining compliance with multiple regulators, and multiple centers within the FDA, adds complexity and cost to our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, and these facilities are subject to the FDA's Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices. We or our contractors may fail to satisfy these regulatory requirements in the future, and any failure to do so may prevent us from selling our products.\nIf, despite internal testing and testing by customers, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet applicable specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense.\nAdditionally, a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall could divert managerial and financial resources, be difficult and costly to correct, result in the suspension of sales of certain of our products, harm our reputation and the reputation of our products and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur reliance on one third-party manufacturer for certain of our product lines and a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials, components and subassemblies for our products exposes us to increased risks associated with production delays, delivery schedules, manufacturing capability, quality control, quality assurance and costs.\nWe have sole source third-party manufacturers for each of our Panther and Tigris molecular diagnostics instruments and for our Skeletal Health products. Similarly, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products due to cost, quality, expertise or other considerations. For example, we rely on a single source supplier for Alexandrite rods used in the lasers for our Elite and PicoSure systems, our SmartCool cooling systems for our SculpSure laser system and the SLT II laser system that we integrate with our own proprietary software and delivery systems for our SmartLipo Triplex, Cellulaze and PrecisionTx systems. We have no firm long-term volume commitments with certain of our sole source suppliers, including the manufacturers of our Panther or Tigris instruments.\nSimilarly, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for some key raw materials for our products due to cost, quality, expertise or other considerations, and some of these suppliers are competitors. For example, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd, a direct competitor of our Diagnostics business, is the parent company of Roche Diagnostics Corporation, our current supplier of certain key raw materials for certain of our amplified NAT diagnostic assays. GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., an affiliate of GE, supplies us with the membranes used in connection with our ThinPrep product line. GE is a direct competitor with our Breast Health and Skeletal Health businesses.\nIf any of sole source manufacturers or suppliers, or our other of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers, experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its development or manufacturing operations or becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to supply us with goods in sufficient quantities, then shipments to our customers could be delayed, which would decrease our revenues and harm our competitive position and reputation. Moreover, the failure of a supplier to provide sufficient quantities, acceptable quality and timely delivery of goods at an acceptable price, or an interruption in the delivery of goods from such a supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of products, components, subassemblies or raw materials could involve significant delays and other costs and regulatory challenges and may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe may in the future need to find new contract manufacturers or suppliers to replace existing manufacturers or suppliers, increase our volumes or reduce our costs. We may not be able to find contract manufacturers or suppliers that meet our needs, including regulatory requirements, and even if we do, the process of qualifying such alternative manufacturers and suppliers is often expensive and time consuming. As a result, we may lose revenues and our customer relationships may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete, and we continue to assess the key personnel that we believe are essential to our long-term success. If we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed. Additionally, facilitating seamless leadership transitions for key positions is a critical factor in sustaining the success of an organization. If our succession planning efforts are not effective, it could adversely impact our business.\nMoreover, in our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees. The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly management or key research and development personnel, could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research\nand development, operational or strategic objectives. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe face intense competition from other companies and may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants, and these competitive pressures may reduce our gross margins. Other companies may develop products that are superior to and/or less expensive than our products. Improvements in existing competitive products or the introduction of new competitive products may reduce our ability to compete for sales, particularly if those competitive products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs.\nSome companies may have significant competitive advantages over us, which may make them more attractive to hospitals, radiology clients, group purchasing organizations, laboratories, and physicians. Such competitive advantages may include:\n\u2022\ngreater brand recognition;\n\u2022\nlarger or more established distribution networks and customer bases;\n\u2022\na broader product portfolio, resulting in the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nhigher levels of automation and greater installed bases of such equipment;\n\u2022\nmore extensive research, development, sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities and greater financial resources; and\n\u2022\ngreater technical resources positioning them to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry.\nThe current environment of managed care, economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, together with current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures, may put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes. If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors and existing and future alternative products, our business and prospects could be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in healthcare-related laws and regulations or our inability to obtain in a timely manner or at all U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;\n\u2022\nchanges in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products; and\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices.\nGiven the high level of regulatory oversight to which our products are subject, the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Most medical devices cannot be marketed in the U.S. without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the FDA. Any modifications to a device that has received a pre-market approval that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device require a pre-market approval supplement or possibly a separate pre-market approval, either of which is likely to be time-consuming, expensive and uncertain to obtain. If the FDA requires us to seek one or more pre-market approval supplements or new pre-market approvals for any modification to a previously approved device, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified device until we obtain approval, and we may be subject to significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, regulatory fines or penalties. Last year, we received a letter from the FDA regarding the MonaLisa\nTouch\u00ae laser and whether our existing 510(k) clearances adequately include certain claims made on our website. In connection with this inquiry, we elected to suspend marketing and distribution of our TempSure Vitalia handpieces and single-use probes until we assessed the implications of recent FDA considerations for devices in this category. This suspension had a negative impact on our revenue. States may also regulate the manufacture, sale and use of medical devices, particularly those that employ x-ray technology.\nOur products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \u201cEU IVDR\u201d), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2020 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Complying with the requirements of these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\nThe regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our China operations, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nWe anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that changes in laws, regulations or policies by governmental authorities may cause increased uncertainties and compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our business and operations. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of Hologic and its customers, business partners and suppliers products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data on these products, systems and networks. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable, and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats, and there is no assurance that the impact from such threats will not be material. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. We also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our implementation of controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. Data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems, to date we do not believe any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.\nThe failure of third-party payors to provide appropriate levels of coverage and reimbursement for the use of our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products and treatments facilitated by our products could harm our business and prospects.\nSales and market acceptance of our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products and the treatments facilitated by these products is dependent upon the coverage decisions and reimbursement policies established by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. These policies affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless appropriate reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S. and other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our diagnostics, breast and skeletal health and surgical products or denies coverage for those procedures\nfacilitated by our products, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHealthcare cost containment legislation, including the associated rules and regulations, and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of any such legislation, could harm our business and prospects.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in the U.S., as well as state-level healthcare reform proposals could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products. These reforms include a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. The impact of this healthcare reform legislation, and practices including price regulation, competitive pricing, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed care arrangements could harm our business and prospects, results of operations and/or financial condition. Healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the U.S. and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products, reduce reimbursement available for such use, further tax the sale or use of our products, adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted, and further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance.\nThese reforms and cost containment measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could also have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products and/or procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, increase cost containment pressures or impose taxes or additional costs on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGuidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations may reduce the use of our products.\nProfessional societies, government agencies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors. If followed by healthcare providers and insurers, such publications could result in decreased use of our products. For example, in November 2012, the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, known as the ACOG, released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released in March 2012 by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, or the USPSTF, and the American Cancer Society. We believe that these recommendations and guidelines may have contributed to increased screening intervals for cervical cancer, which we believe has and may continue to adversely affect our ThinPrep revenues. In addition, on October 20, 2015, the American Cancer Society issued new guidelines recommending that women start annual mammograms at age 45 instead of 40 and have a mammogram every two years instead of annually. This recommendation could result in a decrease in purchases of our mammography systems.\nIf the U.S. medical device excise tax on medical devices is reinstated our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe United States imposed a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. As such, this excise tax applied to the majority, if not all, of our products sold in the U.S. The implementation of the medical device tax was suspended for calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The tax for sales after December 31, 2019 will be reinstated unless there is legislative effort to temporarily suspend or permanently repeal the tax. While the excise tax was in effect, it increased our costs of doing business, and its reinstatement would increase our operating expenses, impose significant additional administrative burdens and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our significant market segments, which could harm our business and prospects.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, which we expect will continue, including with respect to hospitals and clinical laboratories. This consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. We are dependent upon a relatively small number of large clinical laboratory customers in the U.S. for a significant portion of our sales of diagnostics products. Due in part to a trend toward consolidation of clinical\nlaboratories in recent years and the relative size of the largest U.S. laboratories, it is likely that a significant portion of these sales will continue to be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories.\nInterruptions, delays, shutdowns or damage at our manufacturing facilities could harm our business.\nIn most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. An interruption in manufacturing capabilities at any of these facilities, as a result of equipment failure or other reasons, could reduce, delay or prevent the production of our products. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or weather conditions. Manufacturing facilities may experience plant shutdowns, strikes or other labor disruptions, or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, gray outs, delays in deliveries or extensive damage, which could harm our business and prospects. Some of our manufacturing operations are located outside the U.S., including in Costa Rica and the UK. Those manufacturing operations are also subject to additional challenges and risks associated with international operations described herein.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false or fraudulent claims.\nWe are subject to the provisions of a federal law commonly known as the anti-kickback statute, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similarly, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also includes stringent reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals. Specifically, under one provision of the law, which is commonly referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect data on and annually report to CMS certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and annually report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. Anti-kickback and false claims laws and the Physician Payment Sunshine Act prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial.\nSimilarly, our international operations are subject to the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\"FCPA\"), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering or making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Our international operations are also subject to various other international anti-bribery laws such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal policies and procedures, we may not always prevent unauthorized, reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents, or employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also could be subject to adverse publicity, severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions. Moreover, our failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, and withdrawal of an approved product from the market.\nOur international operations and foreign acquisitions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.\nInternational expansion is a key component of our growth strategy. In fiscal 2019, 24.7% of our revenue came from outside of the U.S. As we grow internationally, our future and existing international operations may subject us to a number of additional risks and expenses, any of which could harm our operating results. These risks and expenses include:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic changes and disruptions, export/import controls and tariff regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\ngovernmental currency controls;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations (including, among other things, antitrust and tax requirements);\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the collection of trade accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses related to implementing internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with customizing products for clients in foreign countries;\n\u2022\npossible adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or favorable third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\noperation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices;\n\u2022\nthe inability to effectively obtain, maintain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, and the inability to otherwise protect against clone or \u201cknock off\u201d products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of ability to enforce non-compete agreements with former owners of acquired businesses competing with us in China and other foreign countries; and\n\u2022\nlower margins on a number of our products sold outside of the U.S.\nOur Diagnostics segment depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its product sales, the loss of any of these customers or any cancellation or delay of a large purchase by any of these customers could significantly reduce revenues in our Diagnostics segment.\nAlthough we do not currently have any customers that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, a material portion of product sales in our Diagnostics segment comes from (and we anticipate will continue to come from) a limited number of customers, one of whom accounted for 14.5% of our Diagnostics segment revenue in fiscal 2019. The loss of any of these key customers, or a significant reduction in sales volume or pricing to these customers, could significantly reduce our Diagnostics segment revenues or profitability.\nIf we cannot maintain our current corporate collaborations and enter into new corporate collaborations, our product development could be delayed and our revenue could be adversely impacted.\nWe have relied and/or expect to rely on corporate collaborators for funding development, marketing, distribution, and the commercialization of certain products. If any of our corporate collaborators were to breach, terminate, fail to renew our agreements or otherwise fail to properly conduct its obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization and subsequent marketing of the products contemplated by the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Further, we would be required to devote additional resources to product development or marketing, to terminate some development programs or to seek alternative corporate collaborations. Any corporate collaboration may divert management time and resources. In some instances, we have entered into corporate collaborations with certain partners or companies that could make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business and prospects.\nThe markets for our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products may not develop as expected.\nThe successful commercialization of our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products are subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainty of the development of a market for such product;\n\u2022\ntrends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products or technologies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe perception of our products as compared to other products;\n\u2022\nrecommendation and support for the use of our products by influential customers, such as highly regarded hospitals, physicians and treatment centers;\n\u2022\nthe availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and\n\u2022\nother technological developments.\nOften, the development of a significant market for a product will depend upon the establishment of a reimbursement code or an advantageous reimbursement level for use of the product. Moreover, even if addressed, such reimbursement codes or levels frequently are not established until after a product is developed and commercially introduced, which can delay the successful commercialization of a product.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our newly developed products and newly introduced enhancements to our existing products our business and prospects could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on technologies we license, and if we fail to maintain these licenses or license new technologies and rights to particular nucleic acid sequences for targeted diseases in the future, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.\nOur business is dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. For example, our patented TMA technology is based on technology we licensed from Stanford University. We anticipate that we will enter into new licensing arrangements in the ordinary course of business to expand our product portfolio and access new technologies to enhance our products and develop new products. Many of these licenses will provide us with exclusive rights to the subject technology or disease marker. If our license with respect to any of these technologies or markers is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to sell products that incorporate the technology. Similarly, we may lose competitive advantages if we fail to maintain exclusivity under an exclusive license.\nOur ability to develop additional diagnostic tests for diseases may depend on the ability of third parties to discover particular sequences or markers and correlate them with disease, as well as the rate at which such discoveries are made. Our ability to design products that target these diseases may depend on our ability to obtain the necessary rights from the third parties that make any of these discoveries. In addition, there are a finite number of diseases and conditions for which our NAT diagnostic assays may be economically viable. If we are unable to access new technologies or the rights to particular sequences or markers necessary for additional diagnostic products on commercially reasonable terms, we may be limited in our ability to develop new diagnostic products.\nOur products and manufacturing processes may require access to technologies and materials that may be subject to patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the additional intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize our products.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology.\nWe have relied primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality procedures to protect our products and technology. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property, or copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology. The pursuit and assertion of a patent right, particularly in areas like nucleic acid diagnostics and biotechnology, involve complex determinations and, therefore, are characterized by substantial uncertainty. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents that do issue will be challenged or invalidated. The patents that we own or license could also be subjected to invalidation proceedings or similar disputes, and an unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to the technology from the prevailing party. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in the field of biotechnology. As a result, patents might not issue from certain of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us.\nWe have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our U.S. patents and patent applications. There is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology. Moreover, there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S.\nThe rights provided by a patent are finite in time. Over the coming years, certain patents relating to current products will expire in the U.S. and abroad thus allowing third parties to utilize certain of our technologies.\nOur competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology that our patents do not cover. In addition, because patent applications in the U.S. are not generally publicly disclosed until eighteen months after the application is filed, applications may have been filed by third parties that relate to our technology. Even if our proprietary information is protected\nby patents or otherwise, the initiation of actions to protect our proprietary information could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, and the outcome of such litigation is often uncertain. As a result of these uncertainties, we could also elect to forego such litigation or settle such litigation without fully enforcing our proprietary rights. In the absence of significant patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products, processes or technology.\nWithin our Medical Aesthetics business, we jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third parties. In the absence of an agreement with each co-owner of jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. Some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries.\nOur business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device, diagnostic products and related industries. We are and have been involved in patent litigation and may in the future be subject to further claims of infringement of intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. In connection with claims of patent infringement, we may seek to enter into settlement and/or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology. These actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. As a result, any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims, whether or not proven to be true, may harm our business and prospects.\nWe utilize distributors for a portion of our sales, the loss of which could harm our revenues in the territory serviced by these distributors.\nWe rely on strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products. If any of our strategic relationships terminate without replacement or if our strategic partners fail to perform their contractual obligations, our revenues and/or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. We do not control our distributors, and these parties may not be successful in marketing our products. These parties may fail to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations.\nIf we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales and marketing resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would significantly increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. If we fail to successfully market our products, our product sales will decrease. We may also be exposed to risks as a result of transitioning a territory from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers, hiring appropriately trained personnel or ensuring compliance with local product registration requirements, any of which could result in lower revenues than previously received from the distributor in that territory.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation.\nOur results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of reimbursement for our products domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe development status and demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe development status and demand for therapies to treat the health concerns addressed by our products;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in our markets;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of orders;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products we sell and markets we serve;\n\u2022\nregulatory approval and compliance of products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\npricing and other competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\ncomplex revenue recognition rules pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as U.S. GAAP;\n\u2022\nasset impairments;\n\u2022\ncontingent consideration charges;\n\u2022\nrestructuring and consolidation charges;\n\u2022\ndebt refinancing charges and expenses; and\n\u2022\nseasonality of sales of certain of our products.\nCustomers may also cancel or reschedule shipments. Production difficulties could also delay shipments. Any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects.\nFailure to comply with laws relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards related to the transmission of electronic health data, may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.\nState, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, regulate the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specified electronic transactions, for example transactions involving submission of claims to third-party payors. These standards also continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply.\nOutside the U.S., we are impacted by privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the EU, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules have been enacted. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies uniformly across the EU and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the EU to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules.\nFailure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to the risk of product liability claims relating to our products for which we may not have adequate insurance.\nOur business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business. If even one of our products is found to have caused or contributed to injuries or deaths, we could be held liable for substantial damages. We maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions. There is a risk that the insurance coverage will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims, or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. An under-insured or uninsured claim could harm our business and prospects. In addition, claims could adversely affect the reputation of the related product, which could damage that product\u2019s competitive position in the market.\nThe sale and use of our diagnostic products could also lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect that resulted in inaccurate test results or the failure to detect a disorder for which it was being used to screen, or caused injuries to a patient. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure additional coverage in the future. Also, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend, which could result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business and could adversely affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and could harm our business and prospects.\nBecause we do not require training for users of our non-invasive Medical Aesthetics products, and we sell these products to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of these products, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nFederal regulations allow us to sell our Medical Aesthetics products to or on the order of practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training and, in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the U.S., many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. We do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor can we require that direct medical supervision occur. We and our distributors offer product training sessions, but neither we nor our distributors require purchasers or operators of our non-invasive products to attend training sessions. The lack of required training and the purchase and use of our non-invasive products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to our use and recycling of hazardous materials and the composition of our products.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds, and the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In such event, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could be extensive. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, regulations enacted in the EU such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances, or REACH, which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or RoHS, which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products we manufacture, and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE, which requires the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from certain products we manufacture. These and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China and various states of the U.S. may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. These redesigns or the use of alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, result in additional costs or have other similar effects. We are also subject to other substantial regulation relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including occupational health and safety, environmental protection, hazardous substance control, and waste management and disposal. The failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to, among other things, fines and criminal liability. We may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and future regulations, which may result in a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAn adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAt least annually, we review the carrying value of our goodwill, and for other long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment of the value of these assets. Conditions that could indicate impairment and necessitate an evaluation of these assets include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or the legal or regulatory environment within which we operate. In addition, the deterioration of a company\u2019s market capitalization significantly below its net book value is an indicator of impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we identified indicators of impairment for our Medical Aesthetics reporting unit as a result of reductions in forecasts during the year, and in connection with our efforts to sell the business that began prior to the end of fiscal 2019. We executed a definitive agreement on November 20, 2019 to sell the business. The definitive agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants customary for a transaction of this nature, and the completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete this transaction on a timely basis, if at all. Although this agreement was signed subsequent to the balance sheet date, we concluded that it provided evidence regarding the estimate of fair value of the asset group at September 28, 2019 and that there were no events that occurred between September 28, 2019 and the date we entered into the definitive agreement that would significantly affect the fair value of the asset group. As a result of these indicators of impairment, we recorded total impairment charges of $685.4 million in fiscal 2019.\nAlthough we believe that we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. Any significant adverse change regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and discount rates used in valuing our reporting units could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. It is possible that the continuation of the current global financial and economic uncertainty could negatively affect our anticipated future cash flows, or the discount rates used to value the cash flows for each of our reporting units to such an extent that we could be required to perform an interim impairment test during fiscal 2020.\nWe cannot assure we will be able to close our pending sale of Cynosure on a timely basis, if at all.\nOur pending sale of Cynosure is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the purchase and sale agreement, the failure of the parties to the transaction to satisfy conditions to completion of the proposed transaction, the risk that regulatory or other approvals are delayed or subject to terms and conditions that are not anticipated. As a result, we cannot assure that the pending transaction will be completed on a timely basis, if at all. The purchase price is subject to adjustment and may be different than we anticipate, and we may incur unexpected liabilities in connection with the transaction.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by numerous factors including a change in, or the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, a change in our geographic earnings mix, or a change in the measurement of our deferred taxes.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding, which limits our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of September 28, 2019, we had approximately $3.1 billion aggregate principal of indebtedness outstanding. We also have other contractual obligations. This significant level of indebtedness and our other obligations may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the terms of our financing obligations contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends, repurchase our common stock, or make other distributions or restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nagree to payment restrictions affecting the restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nuse the proceeds of permitted sales of our assets.\nOur amended and restated credit facilities also require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our amended and restated credit facilities, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments or a change of control, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately and may be cross-defaulted to other debt, including our outstanding notes. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default or a change of control, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.\nA significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.\nA significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. As of September 28, 2019, approximately $1.7 billion aggregate principal of our indebtedness, which represented the outstanding principal under our Term Loan under our 2018 Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, was subject to floating interest rates. We currently have certain hedging arrangements in the form of interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements in place to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates. The interest rate cap agreements hedge $1.0 billion of principal under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and have a December 2019 termination date and December 2020 termination date for the interest rate cap agreements entered into in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge $1.0 billion of principal under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with an effective date of December 2020 and termination date of December 2023.\nThe proposed discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR would require us to amend certain agreements and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. If changes are made to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our Credit Agreement and related interest rate swap agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter, bylaws, and indebtedness may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur charter, bylaws, and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. Our indebtedness also contains provisions which either accelerate or require us to offer to repurchase the indebtedness at a premium upon a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\n\u2022\nnew, or changes in, recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;\n\u2022\nannouncements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\npublished studies and reports relating to the comparative efficacy of products and markets in which we participate;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the U.S. or worldwide economy;\n\u2022\nour stock repurchase program;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations;\n\u2022\nnew products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of healthcare reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future; and\n\u2022\nthe success or lack of success of integrating our acquisitions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of \u201chigh-tech\u201d and life sciences companies, have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may decline.", "PERMNO": 76095, "SIC": 3844, "TIC": "HOLX"}
