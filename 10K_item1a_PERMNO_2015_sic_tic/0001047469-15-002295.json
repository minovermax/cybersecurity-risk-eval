{"cik": "1318568", "company": "Global Cash Access Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following section describes material risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our stock. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements and \"Item7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \"included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not remain profitable.\nWe had a net income of $12.1 million and $24.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result of the interest payments on the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, amortization of intangible assets associated with the Merger and other acquisitions, other related acquisition and financing costs, and depreciation and other amortization, we may not be able to remain profitable in the future. We expect to continue to incur substantial charges in the future in connection with the Merger and future acquisitions and we cannot assure you that we will generate net profits from operations in 2015 or subsequent years. Our ability to generate net profits in the future will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022 successfully integrate our cash access and gaming operations;\n\u2022 attract and retain an adequate customer base;\n\u2022 effectively manage a larger and more diversified business;\n\u2022 react to changes, including regulatory and technological changes, in the markets we target or operate in;\n\u2022 sell our products and services into additional markets;\n\u2022 respond to competitive developments and challenges;\n\u2022 successfully complete the conversion of our third-party processor; our ability to comply with the Europay, MasterCard and Visa global standard for cars equipped with computer chips;\n\u2022 attract and retain experienced and talented personnel; and\n\u2022 establish strategic business relationships. We may not be able to do any of these successfully, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows, which could, among other things, affect our ability to make payments under our Credit Facilities or the Notes.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.2 billion, which included the Credit Facilities and the Notes, and contains restrictive covenants. Our high degree of leverage could have significant adverse effects on our business, including:\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022 requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the Notes, and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the Notes, will depend upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including those under the Credit Facilities, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the holders of the notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding amounts under such facilities due and payable and terminate their commitments to loan money, and, in each case, foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Facilities, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022 pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 issue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; and\n\u2022 enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates. These covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Facilities require us to comply with a financial maintenance covenant under certain circumstances. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facilities, if applicable. If we violate this covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the Credit Facilities would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Based on cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur net operating loss and other tax credit carry-forwards are subject to limitations that could potentially reduce these tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had tax-effected U.S. Federal and various state net operating loss (\"NOL\") carry-forwards of approximately $63.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively, that if unused, will expire starting in 2015. Based on the weight of positive and negative evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these NOL and other tax credit carry-forwards, with the exception of certain state NOL carry-forwards that already have a valuation allowance. However, our ability to utilize these NOL and other tax credit carry-forwards to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including the possibility that projected future taxable income is insufficient to realize the full benefit of these NOL carry-forwards prior to their expiration. Additionally, our ability to fully use these tax assets could be adversely affected by the limitations of Sections 382, 383 and 384 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe gaming industry is intensely competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for cash access products, gaming devices and operations and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future. In our cash access business, we compete with other established providers of cash access products and services, including third-party transaction processors, financial institutions and other regional and local banks that operate ATMs on the premises of gaming establishments, as well as from gaming establishments that operate their own proprietary cash access systems. In both our cash access business and our gaming operations (including, but not limited to, lottery, Class II, Class III and commercial slot markets), some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers with respect to other financial services, greater financial, research, design, development, marketing, technological and other\nresources, and more ready access to capital resources, which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, be in a better position to compete as well as, in respect of our cash access business, to pay higher commissions or other incentives to gaming establishments in order to gain new customers. To the extent that we lose customers to these competitors, or competitive pressures force us to offer incentives or less favorable pricing terms to us to establish or maintain relationships with gaming establishments, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent upon consumer demand for gaming and overall economic trends specific to the gaming industry. Economic downturns or a decline in the popularity of gaming could reduce the number of patrons that use our products and services or the amounts of cash that they access using our services.\nWe provide our cash access and gaming-related products and services almost exclusively to gaming establishments. As a result, our business depends on consumer demand for gaming. gaming is a discretionary leisure activity, participation in which has in the past and may in the future decline during economic downturns due to decreases in our customers' disposable income or general tourism activities, as well as during periods of declining consumer confidence due to general economic conditions, geopolitical concerns or other factors. gaming competes with other leisure activities as a form of consumer entertainment and may lose popularity as new leisure activities arise or as other leisure activities become more popular. In addition, gaming in traditional gaming establishments (to which we sell our products and services) competes with Internet-based gaming. The popularity and acceptance of gaming is also influenced by the prevailing social mores and changes in social mores, including changes driven by social responsibility organizations that are dedicated to addressing problem gaming, which could result in reduced acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity or litigation or lobbying efforts focused on limiting gaming activities. To the extent that the popularity of gaming in traditional gaming establishments declines as a result of any of these factors, the demand for our cash access and gaming-related products and services, or the willingness of our customers to spend new capital on acquiring gaming equipment or utilize revenue share agreements, may decline and our business may be harmed.\nMost of our gaming device contracts with our customers are on a month-to-month basis, and if we are unable to maintain our current customers on terms that are favorable to us, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows may suffer a material adverse effect.\nMost of our gaming device contracts with our customers are generally on a month-to-month basis, except for customers with whom we have entered into development and placement fee agreements. We do not rely upon the stated term of our gaming device contracts to retain the business of our customers. We rely instead upon providing competitive player terminals, games and systems to give our customers the incentive to continue doing business with us. At any point in time, a significant portion of our gaming device business is subject to nonrenewal, which may materially and adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and cash flows. To renew or extend any of our customer contracts generally, we may be required to accept financial and other terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of the expired contracts. In addition, we may not succeed in renewing customer contracts when they expire. If we are required to agree to other less favorable terms to retain our customers or we are not able to renew our relationships with our customers upon the expiration of our contracts, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\nConsolidation among our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nWe often execute contracts with customers pursuant to which we provide products and services at multiple gaming establishments. Accordingly, the expiration or termination of a single key contract can mean the loss of multiple gaming facilities at which our products and services are used. In addition, consolidation among operators of gaming establishments may also result in the loss of customers if one of our customers is acquired by a business that utilizes one of our competitors.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from Native American tribal customers, and our ability to effectively operate in Native American gaming markets is vulnerable to legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the ability to enforce contractual rights on Native American land.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from the provision of cash access and gaming-related products and services to gaming facilities operated on Native American lands.\nNative American tribes are independent governments with sovereign powers and, in the absence of a specific grant of authority by Congress to a state or a specific compact or agreement between a tribal entity and a state that would allow the state to regulate activities taking place on Native American lands, they can enact their own laws and regulate gaming operations and contracts. In this capacity, Native American tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits similar to that of the individual states and the United States. Accordingly, before we can seek to enforce contract rights with a Native American tribe, or an agency or instrumentality of a Native American tribe, we must obtain from the Native American tribe a waiver of its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute, which we are not always able to do. Without a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, or if such waiver is held to be ineffective, we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against a Native American tribe, including the right to enter Native American lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribal party to that contract. Even if the waiver of sovereign immunity by a Native American tribe is deemed effective, there could be an issue as to the forum in which a lawsuit may be brought against the Native American tribe. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and generally do not have jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to Native American tribes, and we may be unable to enforce any arbitration decision effectively. Although we attempt to agree upon governing law and venue provisions in our contracts with Native American tribal customers, these provisions vary widely and may not be enforceable.\nCertain of our agreements with Native American tribes are subject to review by regulatory authorities. For example, our development agreements are subject to review by the NIGC, and any such review could require substantial modifications to our agreements or result in the determination that we have a proprietary interest in a Native American tribe's gaming activity, which could materially and adversely affect the terms on which we conduct our business. The NIGC has previously expressed the view that some of our development agreements could be in violation of the requirements of the IGRA and Native American tribal gaming regulations, which state that the Native American tribes must hold \"sole proprietary interest\" in the Native American tribes' gaming operations, which presents additional risk for our business. The NIGC may also reinterpret applicable laws and regulations, which could affect our agreements with Native American tribes. We could also be affected by alternative interpretations of the Johnson Act as the Native American tribes, who are the customers for our Class II games, could be subject to significant fines and penalties if it is ultimately determined they are offering an illegal game, and an adverse regulatory or judicial determination regarding the legal status of our products could have material adverse consequences for our business, financial condition, operations, cash flows or prospects.\nGovernment enforcement, regulatory action, judicial decisions and proposed legislative action have in the past, and will likely continue to affect our business, financial condition, operations, cash flows and prospects in Native American tribal lands. The legal and regulatory uncertainties surrounding our Native American tribal agreements could result in a significant and immediate material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows. Additionally, such uncertainties could increase our cost of doing business and could take management's attention away from operations. Regulatory action against our customers or equipment in these or other markets could result in machine seizures and significant revenue disruptions, among other adverse consequences. Moreover, Native American tribal policies and procedures, as well as tribal selection of gaming vendors, are subject to the political and governance environment within each Native American tribe. Changes in tribal leadership or tribal political pressure can affect our business relationships within Native American markets.\nCertain Native American tribes require us to contract with entities that are owned, controlled or managed by tribal members to provide a portion of our services. In some instances, these entities are subcontractors of ours in connection with providing our services, while in other instances we are a subcontractor to these entities who contract with the applicable tribal gaming casino or tribe directly to provide cash access services. Our ability to provide our services is dependent upon our relationship with these third parties and their ability to provide services in accordance with the terms of our contractual arrangement with these third parties and, in some instances, the third parties' relationship or contractual arrangement with the applicable tribal gaming casino or tribe.\nOur business depends on our ability to introduce new, commercially viable games, products and services in a timely manner.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to develop and sell new games, products and services that are attractive not only to our customers but also to their customers, the gaming patrons. If our games, products and services do not appeal to gaming operators and patrons, or do not meet or sustain revenue and profitability of contractual obligations and expectations, we may lose business to our competitors. Additionally, we may be unable to enhance existing games, products and services in a timely manner in response to changing regulatory, legal or market conditions or customer requirements, or new games, products and services may not achieve market acceptance in new or existing markets. Furthermore, as we attempt to generate new streams of revenue by selling our games, products and services to new customers in new jurisdictions, we may have difficulty implementing an effective sales strategy for these new jurisdictions. If we are unable to keep pace with rapid innovations in new technologies or product design and deployment or if we are unable to quickly adapt our development, manufacturing or sales processes to compete, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe may not successfully enter new markets and potential new markets may not develop quickly or at all.\nIf and as new and developing domestic markets develop, competition among providers of cash access and gaming-related products and services will intensify. We will face a number of hurdles in our attempts to enter these markets, including the need to expand our sales and marketing presence, compete against pre-existing relationships that our target customers may have with our competitors, the uncertainty of compliance with new or developing regulatory regimes (including regulatory regimes relating to Internet gaming) with which we are not currently familiar and oversight by regulators that are not familiar with us or our businesses. Each of these risks could materially impair our ability to successfully expand our operations into these new and developing domestic markets.\nIn addition, as we attempt to sell our cash access products and services into international markets in which we have not previously operated, we may become exposed to political, economic, tax, legal and regulatory risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the United States. The legal and regulatory regimes of foreign markets and their ramifications on our business are less certain. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including different regulatory requirements and interpretations, trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, higher rates of fraud, compliance with anti-corruption and export control laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty in enforcing or interpreting contracts or legislation, political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences. Difficulties in obtaining approvals, licenses or waivers from the monetary and gaming authorities of other jurisdictions, in addition to other potential regulatory and quasi-regulatory issues that we have not yet ascertained, may arise in international jurisdictions into which we attempt to enter. In these new markets, our operations will rely on an infrastructure of financial services and telecommunications facilities that may not be sufficient to support our business needs, such as the authorization and settlement services that are required to implement electronic payment transactions and the telecommunications facilities that would enable us to reliably connect our networks to our products at gaming establishments in these new markets. In these new markets, we may additionally provide services\nbased upon interpretations of applicable law, which interpretation may be subject to regulatory or judicial review. These risks, among others, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations. In connection with our expansion into new international markets, we may forge strategic relationships with business partners to assist us. The success of our expansion into these markets therefore may depend in part upon the success of the business partners with whom we forge these strategic relationships. If we do not successfully form strategic relationships with the right business partners or if we are not able to overcome cultural or business practice differences, our ability to penetrate these new international markets could suffer.\nWe are subject to the risk that the domestic or international markets we attempt to enter or expand into may not develop as quickly as anticipated, or at all. The development of new gaming markets is subject to political, social, regulatory and economic forces beyond our control. The expansion of gaming activities in new markets can be very controversial and may depend heavily on the support and sponsorship of local government. Changes in government leadership, failure to obtain requisite voter support in referendums, failure of legislators to enact enabling legislation and limitations on the volume of gaming activity that is permitted in particular markets may inhibit the development of new markets. Further, our estimates of the potential future opportunities in new markets are based on a variety of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. To the extent that we overestimate the potential of a new market, incorrectly gauge the timing of the development of a new market or fail to anticipate the differences between a new market and our existing markets, we may fail in our strategy of growing our business by expanding into new markets. Moreover, if we are unable to meet the needs of our existing customers as they enter markets that we do not currently serve, our relationships with these customers could be harmed.\nWe may not realize satisfactory returns on money loaned or otherwise funded to new and existing customers to develop or expand gaming facilities.\nIn our gaming business, we enter into development and placement fee agreements to provide financing for construction, expansion or remodeling of gaming facilities, primarily in the State of Oklahoma. Under our development and placement fee agreements, we secure a long-term revenue share percentage and a fixed number of player terminal placements in the facility in exchange for funding the development and construction of the gaming facility. The success of these ventures is dependent upon the timely completion of the gaming facility, the placement of our player terminals and a favorable regulatory environment. Our development and placement efforts and financing activities may result in operating difficulties, financial and regulatory risks, or required expenditures that could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. In connection with one or more of these transactions, and to obtain the necessary development and placement fee funds, we may need to extend secured and unsecured credit to potential or existing customers that may not be repaid, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, or incur other contingent liabilities. While we believe the increased level of receivables from counterparties to development agreements has allowed us to grow our business, it has also required direct, additional focus of and involvement by management. The failure to maintain controls and processes related to our collection efforts or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on third-party transaction processors, telecommunication networks and other third-party technology providers to provide our cash access and related services, and if we, or any of these third parties, experience system or service failures, the products and services we provide could be delayed or interrupted, which could harm our business and reputation.\nOur ability to provide uninterrupted and high levels of services depends upon the performance of the third-party processors, telecommunication networks and other third-party technology providers that we use. Any significant interruptions in or degradation of the quality of the services that these third parties provide to us could severely harm our business and reputation and lead to the loss of customers and\nrevenue. Our third-party providers and their systems are potentially vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions or outages of our services, delays, loss of data or public release of confidential data, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows. In some instances, such failures could cause us to fail to meet contractual deadlines or specifications and force us to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. We are parties to certain agreements that could require us to pay damages resulting from loss of revenues if our systems are not properly functioning or as a result of a system malfunction. For example, our agreement with the New York Lottery permits termination of the contract at any time for failure by us or our system to perform properly, and any such unforeseen downtime could subject us to liquidated damages. In addition, if we fail to meet the terms specified in our contracts, we may not realize their full benefits. Failure to perform under any contract could result in substantial monetary damages, as well as contract termination. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts.\nWe typically rely on a single third-party processor to process substantially all of our cash access transactions that are processed through various card associations and payment networks, and the failure of our third-party processor to adequately provide such processing services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nWe typically rely on a single third party to provide processing services for the substantial majority of our cash access transactions by obtaining authorizations for ATM cash withdrawal, POS debit card and credit card cash access transactions and to provide settlement transaction files to card associations and payment networks for some of these transactions. In addition, we recently elected to switch third-party processors and began converting our cash access services to a new third-party processor (the \"New Third-Party Processor\") beginning in 2014. If we fail to successfully complete this conversion by June 30, 2016, we will not be able to provide services to our customers or to the locations that are not converted to the New Third-Party Processor which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows. If our third-party processor, including the New Third-Party Processor, fails to adequately provide these services, it could result in our systems being unable to process our cash access transactions intermittently or for extended periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nAn unexpectedly high level of chargebacks, as the result of fraud or otherwise, including in connection with new technology standards being implemented in the United States regarding chip-based cards, could materially and adversely affect our cash access business.\nIn 1994, Europay, MasterCard and Visa jointly developed EMV, designed to deter fraudulent card transactions related to identity theft, counterfeit cards and the misuse of lost or stolen cards via enhanced card authentication, transaction authorization and cardholder verification using chip-based smart-cards. EMV has been adopted in many regions of the world as the global standard for fraud deterrence in chip based smart-card payments. Historically, the U.S. Payments industry has relied on magnetic stripe cards instead of EMV compliant chip-based cards. Recently, however, U.S. card issuers have begun to offer EMV-capable chip-based smart-cards, and beginning on October 1, 2015, the U.S. payment card industry will begin shifting liability for fraudulent transactions generated through EMV-enabled cards onto merchants whose devices are not capable of processing chip-based smart-card EMV transactions. This will shift the responsibility for chargebacks due to fraudulent transactions on such cards from the card issuer onto the merchant. If we fail to comply with these new requirements in time, we will bear the chargeback risk for fraudulent transactions generated through EMV-enabled cards or we may experience a decrease in transaction volume if we cannot process transactions at all for cardholders whose issuer has migrated entirely from magnetic stripe to chip-based smart-cards.\nWhen patrons use our cash access services, we either dispense cash or produce a negotiable instrument that can be exchanged for cash. If a completed cash access transaction is subsequently disputed, and if we are unsuccessful in establishing the validity of the transaction, we may not be able to collect payment for such transaction and such transaction becomes a chargeback. In the event that we incur chargebacks in excess of specified levels, we could lose our sponsorship into the card associations or be censured by the card associations by way of fines or otherwise. Our failure to adequately manage our chargebacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nChanges in consumer willingness to pay a fee to access their funds could reduce the demand for our cash access products and services.\nOur cash access business depends upon the willingness of patrons to pay a service fee to access their own funds on the premises of a gaming establishment. In most retail environments, consumers typically do not pay an additional fee for using non-cash payment methods such as credit cards, POS debit cards or checks. Gaming patrons could bring more cash with them to gaming establishments or access cash outside of gaming establishments without paying a fee for the convenience of not having to leave the gaming establishment. To the extent that gaming patrons become unwilling to pay these fees for convenience or lower cost cash access alternatives become available, the demand for cash access services within gaming establishments will decline and our business could suffer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on developing and protecting our intellectual property. We rely on copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on other confidentiality and contractual agreements and arrangements with our employees, affiliates, business partners and customers to establish and protect our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights. While we expect these agreements and arrangements to be honored, we cannot assure you that they will be and, despite our efforts, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by, competitors. Any litigation relating to the defense of our intellectual property, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nIn addition, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay royalties to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be required to enter into a license agreement and pay license fees, or we may be required to stop using the technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable amount of time. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nWe rely on hardware, software and games licensed from third parties, and on technology provided by third-party vendors, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our business, increase our costs and delay deployment or suspend development of our gaming systems and player terminals.\nWe have entered into license agreements with third parties for the exclusive use of their technology and intellectual property rights in the gaming industry, such as our license to use portions of the software infrastructure upon which our cash access systems operate, and we also rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our gaming devices, fully integrated kiosks and jackpot kiosks. We rely on these other parties to maintain and protect this technology and the related intellectual property rights. If our licensors fail to protect their intellectual property rights in material that we license and we are unable to protect such intellectual property rights, the value of our licenses may diminish significantly and our business could\nbe significantly harmed. In addition, if these agreements expire and we are unable to renew them, or if the manufacturers of this software or hardware, or functional equivalents of this software or hardware, were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms, we may lose a valuable competitive advantage and our business could be harmed.\nActs of God, adverse weather and shipping difficulties, particularly with respect to international third-party suppliers of our components, could cause significant production delays. If we are unable to obtain these components from our established third-party vendors, we could be required to either redesign our product to function with alternate third-party products or to develop or manufacture these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in the deployment of our gaming systems and player terminals. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future offerings.\nWe rely on intellectual property licenses from one or more third-party competitors, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the sale or placement of our products. Various third-party gaming manufacturers with which we compete are much larger than us and have substantially larger intellectual property assets. The gaming manufacturer industry is very competitive and litigious, and a lawsuit brought by one of our larger competitors, whether or not well-founded, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows and our ability to sell or place our products.\nOur use of open source software may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products and services in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nSome of our gaming products may incorporate open source software. Some open source licenses mandate, as a condition of use of the open source software that is subject to the license, that software developed based upon such open source software, or combined in certain ways with such open source software, become subject to the open source license, or the proprietary software may become infected. If our proprietary software were thus infected, we could be required to stop using the infecting open sources of software (which would require us to obtain commercial licenses or develop alternative software, which could be costly or time consuming) or make any of our proprietary software that was infected available to the public in source code form without charge. We take steps to ensure that proprietary software we do not wish to disclose is not combined with, or does not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require such proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted the open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters. Any interruption to our business resulting from a natural disaster will adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn the event of a natural disaster, the operations of gaming establishments could be negatively impacted or consumer demand for gaming could decline, or both, and as a result, our business could be interrupted, which will materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions, particularly flooding, tornadoes, heavy snowfall and other extreme weather conditions often deter our customer's end users from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent the sites where our games are installed. If any of those sites experienced prolonged adverse weather conditions, or if the sites in the State of Oklahoma, where a significant number of our games are installed, simultaneously experienced adverse weather conditions, our results of business, financial condition and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may lead to our inability to accurately report our financial results.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. Our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting has identified material weaknesses in the past, each of which we subsequently remediated, but new material weaknesses may arise in the future. Our failure to identify, or to remediate identified, material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, cause a decline or volatility in our stock prices, cause a reduction in our credit ratings or tarnish our reputation. Also, increased expenses due to remediation costs and increased regulatory scrutiny are also possible.\nIf our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation, financial condition, operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks; however, these methods may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods may depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. If our methods are not fully effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nChanges by M&C International and First Data Corporation to certain of their tax returns may have an impact on the value of a component of our deferred tax asset, which could require us to recalculate the starting balance of the deferred tax asset and the annual amortization thereof.\nIn connection with a recapitalization and private equity restructuring that occurred in 2004 involving our former owners, First Data Corporation (\"First Data\"), M&C International (\"M&C\") and entities affiliated with Bank of America, N.A., we recorded a deferred tax asset of $247.0 million. In connection with this deferred tax asset, we expect to pay a significantly lower amount in United States federal income taxes than we provide for in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Our calculation of the starting balance of the deferred tax asset is based upon information we received from First Data and M&C about the gains they recorded in the transaction. If First Data or M&C change their calculation of the gains and file amended tax returns, we may be required to recalculate the starting balance of the deferred tax asset and the annual amortization thereof. In addition, unanticipated changes in applicable income tax rates or laws or changes in our tax position or our ability to utilize our deferred tax asset, which may be affected by factors beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Industry\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, liabilities and legal claims resulting from unauthorized disclosure of cardholder and patron data, whether through a security breach of our computer systems, our third-party processor's computer systems or otherwise, or through our unauthorized use or transmission of such data.\nWe collect and store personally identifiable information about cardholders and patrons that perform certain cash access and Central Credit transactions, including names, addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and account numbers, and we maintain a database of cardholder and patron data, including account numbers, in order to process our cash access and Central Credit transactions. We also rely on our third-party processor and certain other technology partners to process and store cardholder and patron data relating to our cash access and Central Credit transactions. As a result, we, as well as our third-party processor, certain of our other technology providers and some of our gaming establishment\ncustomers, are required to comply with various federal and state privacy statutes and regulations and the PCI Data Security Standard. Compliance with these regulations and requirements, which are subject to change at any time, is often difficult and costly, and our failure, or the failure of these other third parties, to comply may result in significant fines or civil penalties, regulatory enforcement action, liability to our sponsor bank and termination of our agreements with our gaming establishment customers, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows. If our computer systems or those of our third-party processor or other technology providers suffer a security breach, we may be subject to liability, including claims for unauthorized transactions with misappropriated bank card information, impersonation or similar fraud claims, as well as for any failure to comply with laws governing required notifications of such a breach, and these claims could result in protracted and costly litigation, penalties or sanctions from the card associations and payment networks, and damage to our reputation, which could reduce and limit our ability to provide cash access and related services to our gaming establishment customers.\nThe personally identifiable information we collect also includes our patrons' transaction behavioral data and credit history data, which we may use to provide marketing and data intelligence services to gaming establishments. This information is increasingly subject to federal, state and card association laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Governmental regulations are typically intended to protect the privacy and security of such data and information as well as to regulate the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, use and distribution of such data and information. We could be materially and adversely affected if domestic or international laws or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their laws or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business or even prohibit us from offering certain marketing and data intelligence or other services. Similarly, if we are required to allocate significant resources to modify our internal operating systems and procedures to enable enhanced protection of patron data that we transmit, store and use, our business results could be adversely affected. In addition, we may face requirements that pose compliance challenges in new international markets that we seek to enter as various foreign jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the storage, transmission and use of gaming patron data. Such variation could subject us to costs, liabilities or negative publicity that could impair our ability to expand our operations into some countries and therefore limit our future growth.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation, which may harm our business.\nOur operation of gaming activities, including the sale and manufacturing of gaming devices, fully integrated kiosks, the provision of cash access services at gaming establishments and the operation of central determinant systems, is subject to extensive regulation by the jurisdictions where we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of our owners, officers and directors, as well as those persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, gaming regulators can require us to cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, the unauthorized operation of gaming or unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our subsidiaries or affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to the possible increase at any time by various state and federal legislatures and officials of gaming taxes or fees, which could adversely affect our results. For a summary of gaming regulations that could affect our business, see \"Item 1. Business-Regulation.\"\nOur ability to conduct both our gaming and cash access businesses, expand operations, develop and distribute new games, products and systems, and expand into new gaming markets is also subject to significant federal, state, local, Native American and foreign regulations. In the United States and many other countries, gaming must be expressly authorized by law. Once authorized, such activities are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. While we seek to comply with the standards and regulations set forth by each jurisdiction, a governmental agency or court could disagree with our interpretation of these standards and regulations or determine that the manufacturing and use of certain of our electronic player terminals, and perhaps other key components of our gaming systems that rely to some extent upon electronic equipment to run a game, constitute illegal gaming. An adverse regulatory or judicial determination regarding the legal status of our products could have material adverse consequences for us in other jurisdictions, including with gaming regulators, and our business, operating results and prospects could suffer and we and our officers and directors could be subject to significant fines and penalties. Furthermore, the failure to become licensed, or the loss or conditioning of a license, in one market may have the adverse effect of preventing licensing in other markets or the revocation of licenses we already maintain.\nAs we expand into new markets, we expect to encounter business, legal, operational and regulatory uncertainties as well as additional responsibilities. As we enter new jurisdictions, we are subject to increasing legal, regulatory and reporting requirements that will require substantial additional resources, such as new licenses, permits and approvals, including third-party certifications that our games comply with a particular jurisdiction's stated regulations, in order to meet our expectations for new market entry, and such licenses, permits or approvals may not be timely granted to us, or granted to us at all, which could have a material effect on our business in general and new market entry specifically. Obtaining and maintaining all required licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits or approvals is time consuming, expensive and potentially distracting to management. As we enter new jurisdictions, our reporting systems will need to be developed and/or updated, and we may fail to provide timely or adequate notifications or reporting requirements within these new jurisdictions, which could have adverse regulatory consequences for us in that, or in other, jurisdictions, which could affect our business. In addition, entry into new markets may require us to make changes to our gaming systems to ensure that they comply with applicable regulatory requirements. We may also encounter additional legal and regulatory challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new market opportunity. If we are unable to effectively develop and operate within these new markets, then our business, operating results and financial condition would be impaired.\nGenerally, our placement of systems, games and technology into new market segments involves a number of business uncertainties, including whether:\n\u2022 the technical platform on which our gaming units, systems and products are based will comply, or can be modified to comply, with the minimum technical requirements for each of the identified new gaming markets;\n\u2022 we are able to successfully pass required field trials and comply with the initial game/system installation requirements for each new jurisdiction;\n\u2022 our resources and expertise will enable us to effectively operate and grow in such new markets, including meeting regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 our internal processes and controls will continue to function effectively within these new segments;\n\u2022 we have enough experience to accurately predict revenues and expenses in these new markets;\n\u2022 the diversion of management attention and resources from our traditional business, caused by entering into new market segments, will have harmful effects on our traditional business;\n\u2022 we will be able to successfully compete against larger companies who dominate the markets that we are trying to enter; and\n\u2022 we can timely perform under our agreements in these new markets because of other unforeseen obstacles. In addition, the suspension, revocation, nonrenewal or limitation of any of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to maintain key employees. The gaming authorities may deny, limit, condition, suspend or revoke a gaming license or related approval for violations of applicable gaming laws and regulations and may impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, changes in existing gaming laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing gaming laws may hinder or prevent us from continuing to operate in those jurisdictions where we currently do business, which could harm our operating results. In particular, the enactment of unfavorable legislation or government efforts affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators, such as referendums to increase gaming taxes or requirements to use local distributors, could have a negative impact on our operations. Moreover, in addition to the risk of enforcement action, we are also at risk of loss of business reputation in the event of any potential legal or regulatory investigation, whether or not we are ultimately accused of or found to have committed any violation.\nMany of the financial services that we provide are subject to extensive rules and regulations, which may harm our business.\nOur Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau and check verification and warranty services are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 and similar state laws. The collection practices that are used by our third-party providers and us may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and applicable state laws relating to debt collection. All of our cash access services and patron marketing services are subject to the privacy provisions of state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Our POS debit card transactions and ATM withdrawal services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Our ATM services are subject to the applicable state banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs. Our ATM services may also be subject to state and local regulations relating to the imposition of daily limits on the amounts that may be withdrawn from ATMs, the location of ATMs, our ability to surcharge cardholders who use our ATMs and the form and type of notices that must be disclosed regarding the provision of our ATM services. The cash access services we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. We are required to file SARs with respect to transactions completed at all gaming establishments at which our cash access services are provided. If we are found to be noncompliant in any way with these laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In jurisdictions in which we serve as a check casher, we are subject to the applicable state licensing requirements and regulations governing check cashing activities. We are also subject to various state licensing requirements and regulations governing money transmitters.\nWe are subject to formal or informal audits, inquiries or reviews from time to time by the regulatory authorities that enforce these financial services rules and regulations. In the event that any regulatory authority determines that the manner in which we provide cash access, patron marketing or gaming patron credit bureau services is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations, or the regulatory authorities adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which we provide cash access, patron marketing or gaming patron credit bureau services, then these regulatory authorities may force us to modify the manner in which we operate or force us to stop processing certain types of cash access transactions or providing patron marketing or gaming patron credit bureau services altogether. We may also be required to pay substantial penalties and fines if we fail to comply with applicable rules and\nregulations. For example, if we fail to file CTRs or SARs on a timely basis or if we are found to be noncompliant in any way with either the Bank Secrecy Act or the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could subject us to private litigation.\nWe are subject to extensive rules and regulations of card associations, including VISA, MasterCard and electronic payment networks that are always subject to change, which may harm our business.\nOur cash access business is subject to the extensive rules and regulations of the leading card associations, VISA and MasterCard. The rules and regulations do not expressly address some of the contexts and settings in which we process cash access transactions or do so in a manner subject to varying interpretations. As an example, we and certain of our providers must comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. The failure by any of such providers to comply with such standards could result in our being fined or being prohibited from processing transactions through VISA, MasterCard and other card and payment networks. We also process transactions involving the use of the proprietary credit cards such as those offered by Discover Card and American Express, as well as other regional cards issued in certain international markets. The rules and regulations of the proprietary credit card networks that service these cards present risks to us that are similar to those posed by the rules and regulations of VISA, MasterCard and other payment networks.\nThe card associations' and payment networks' rules and regulations are always subject to change, and the card associations or payment networks may modify their rules and regulations from time to time. Our inability to anticipate changes in rules and regulations, or the interpretation or application thereof, may result in substantial disruption to our business. In the event that the card associations, payment networks or our sponsoring banks determine that the manner in which we process certain types of card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations, or if the card associations or payment networks adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which we process certain types of card transactions, we may be forced to pay a fine, modify the manner in which we operate our business or stop processing certain types of cash access transactions altogether, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nCard associations and EFT networks may change interchange reimbursement rates or network operating fees or assess new fees associated with the processing and settlement of our cash access transactions or otherwise change their operating rules and regulations without our consent and such changes may affect our revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), net income and our business generally.\nWe receive income from issuers of ATM, credit and debit cards for certain transactions performed on our ATMs related to cash dispensing or certain other non-financial transactions such as balance inquiries. The EFT networks may also charge certain fees related to the performance of these transactions. We refer to the net of this income and fees as reverse interchange. The amount of this reverse interchange income is determined by the card network associations and EFT networks, and this income is subject to decrease at their discretion.\nWe pay interchange and other network fees for services to the credit card associations and EFT networks that they provide in settling transactions routed through their networks. Collectively we call these charges interchange fees. Subject to the limitations imposed by federal regulations such as the Durbin Amendment or other regulations that may be enacted, the amounts of these interchange fees are determined based upon the sole discretion of the card associations and EFT networks and are subject to increase at any time. Although certain of our contracts enable us to pass through increases in interchange or other network processing fees to our customers, competitive pressures might prevent us from passing all or some of these fees through to our customers in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass through to our customers all or any portion of any increase in interchange or other network processing fees, our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) would increase and our net income would decrease,\nassuming no change in transaction volumes. Any such decrease in net income could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nThe card associations and EFT networks may also elect to impose new membership or other fees, or implement new rules and regulations with respect to processing transactions through their networks, and any such new fees, rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nThe provision of our credit card access, POS debit and ATM services are dependent upon our continued sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard card associations, and the suspension or termination of our sponsorship would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nWe process virtually all of our credit card cash access, POS debit and ATM service transactions through the VISA and MasterCard card associations, both domestically and internationally, and virtually all of the revenue that we derive from our credit card cash access, POS debit and ATM services is dependent upon our continued sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard associations. We cannot provide these services without sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard associations by a member financial institution. Our failure to maintain our current sponsorship arrangements or secure alternative sponsorship arrangements into the VISA and MasterCard associations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nOur ATM service business is subject to extensive rules and regulations, which may harm our business.\nOur ATM services are subject to the applicable federal, state and local banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs, which regulations relate to the imposition of daily limits on the amounts that may be withdrawn from ATMs, the location of ATMs, our ability to surcharge cardholders who use our ATMs and the form and type of notices that must be disclosed with respect to the fees we charge to patrons in connection with our ATM services. ATMs are also subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons. These laws and regulations may impose significant burdens on our ability to operate ATMs profitably in some locations, or at all, and our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, because these regulations are subject to change, we may be forced to modify our ATM operations in a manner inconsistent with the assumptions upon which we relied when entering into contracts to provide ATM services at gaming establishments. If federal, state, local or foreign authorities adopt new laws or regulations or raise enforcement levels on existing laws and regulations that make it more difficult for us to operate our ATM business, then our revenues and earnings may be negatively affected. If legislation or regulations are enacted in the future that adversely impact our ATM business, we may be forced to modify our operations in a manner inconsistent with the assumptions upon which we relied when entering into contracts to provide ATMs at gaming establishments and our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\nConsumer privacy laws may change, requiring us to change our business practices or expend significant amounts on compliance with such laws.\nOur patron marketing and database services depend on our ability to collect and use non-public personal information relating to patrons who use our products and services and the transactions they consummate using our services. We are required by federal and state privacy laws and rules to safeguard and protect the privacy of such information, to make disclosures to patrons regarding our privacy and information sharing policies and, in some cases, to provide patrons an opportunity to \"opt out\" of the use of their information for certain purposes. The failure or circumvention of the means by which we safeguard and protect the privacy of information we gather may result in the dissemination of non-public personal information, which may harm our reputation and may expose us to liability to the affected individuals and regulatory\nenforcement proceedings or fines. Regulators reviewing our policies and practices may require us to modify our practices in a material or immaterial manner or impose fines or other penalties if they believe that our policies and practices do not meet the necessary standard. To the extent that our patron marketing and database services have failed, are now failing or in the future fail to comply with applicable law, our privacy policies or the notices that we provide to patrons, we may become subject to actions by a regulatory authority or patrons which cause us to pay monetary penalties or require us to modify the manner in which we provide patron marketing and database services. To the extent that patrons exercise their right to \"opt out,\" our ability to leverage existing and future databases of information would be curtailed. Consumer and data privacy laws are evolving, and due to recent high profile thefts and losses of sensitive consumer information from protected databases, such laws may be broadened in their scope and application, impose additional requirements and restrictions on gathering, encrypting and using patron information or narrow the types of information that may be collected or used for marketing or other purposes or require patrons to \"opt-in\" to the use of their information for specific purposes, or impose additional fines or potentially costly compliance requirements which will hamper the value of our patron marketing and database services.\nWe may experience increased capital requirements, accelerated depreciation and amortization expense and asset write-offs in connection with the EMV standards being implemented in the United States, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nWe are classified as a merchant for purposes of our cash access transactions, so we must upgrade or replace our existing fleet of U.S.-based devices to accept the EMV standard. This requires us to upgrade the software on a significant portion of our currently deployed fleet of U.S.-based POS, kiosks and ATM devices. Additionally, we may have to replace a portion of our devices with newer devices equipped with the minimum hardware requirements to support EMV. The costs involved with upgrading our fleet may cause us to incur increased capital expenditures related to device replacement.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including potential cost synergies, due to challenges associated with integrating the two companies or other factors.\nThe success of the Merger will depend in part on the success of our management in integrating the operations, technologies and personnel following the closing of the Merger. Our management's inability to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could seriously harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies will require substantial attention from our management, particularly in light of the geographically dispersed operations of the two companies, which could further harm our results of operations.\nThe challenges involved in integration include:\n\u2022 integrating the two companies' operations, processes, people, technologies, products and services;\n\u2022 coordinating and integrating sales and marketing and research and development functions;\n\u2022 demonstrating to our customers that the Merger will not result in adverse changes in business focus, products and service deliverables (including customer satisfaction);\n\u2022 assimilating and retaining the personnel of both companies and integrating the business cultures, operations, systems and clients of both companies; and\n\u2022 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and administrative functions.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate operations in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including potential cost and operating synergies or sales or growth opportunities, to the extent or in the time frame anticipated. The anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger are based on assumptions and current expectations, not actual experience, assume a successful integration and reallocation of resources among our facilities without unanticipated costs, and assume our efforts do not have unforeseen or unintended consequences. In addition, our ability to realize the benefits and synergies of the business combination could be adversely impacted to the extent that relationships with existing or potential customers, suppliers or strategic partners are adversely affected as a consequence of the Merger or by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations.\nWe may be unable to retain key personnel, which could materially impact our ability to further develop our business.\nWe depend on the continued performance of the members of our senior management team and certain other key employees to assist in executing our strategy. If we were to lose the services of any of our senior officers, directors or key employees, and are not able to find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner, our business could be materially affected. Further, we expect that our efforts to grow will place a significant strain on our personnel, management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Our ability to manage future growth effectively will also require us to successfully attract, train, motivate, retain and manage new employees and continue to update and improve our operational, financial and management controls and procedures. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us until or after our strategies with respect to the Merger are announced or executed. Similar issues may arise in connection with any future acquisition, merger or disposition. These circumstances may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We also must continue to attract and motivate all of our other employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals following the Merger.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute any of our identified business opportunities or other business opportunities that we determine to pursue, we may not achieve the benefits of the Merger and our business may be harmed.\nAs a result of the Merger, we have approximately 900 employees. In order to pursue business opportunities, we will need to continue to build our infrastructure, customer initiatives and operational capabilities. Our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022 the ability of our technology and hardware, suppliers and service providers to perform as we expect;\n\u2022 our ability to execute our strategy and continue to operate a larger, more diverse business efficiently;\n\u2022 our ability to effectively manage our third-party relationships;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022 our ability to effectively manage our employee costs and other expenses;\n\u2022 our ability to retain our customers and grow the current portfolio of business with each client;\n\u2022 technology and application failures and outages, security breaches or interruption of service, which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our customers;\n\u2022 our ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving service and pricing demands of the markets we serve; and\n\u2022 our ability to raise additional capital to fund our long-term growth plans. Our failure to adequately address the above factors would have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise, which might negatively affect our business.\nWe may have difficulty integrating future acquisitions, which would reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions and the Merger.\nIn addition to the Merger, we intend to continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies, including those that are significant in size and scope. The risks we commonly encounter in acquisitions include:\n\u2022 if, in addition to the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, we incur significant debt to finance a future acquisition and our combined business does not perform as expected, we may have difficulty complying with debt covenants;\n\u2022 we may be unable to make a future acquisition which is in our best interest due to the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022 if we use our stock to make a future acquisition, it will dilute existing stockholders;\n\u2022 we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired company;\n\u2022 the challenge and additional investment involved with integrating new products and technologies into our sales and marketing process;\n\u2022 we may have difficulty effectively integrating any acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies, particularly where such products reside on different technology platforms or overlap with our products;\n\u2022 our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues;\n\u2022 the costs and complexity of integrating the internal information technology infrastructure of each acquired business with ours may be greater than expected and may require additional capital investments;\n\u2022 we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from an acquired business;\n\u2022 we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for any acquired and combined businesses;\n\u2022 we may have difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration period following a future acquisition;\n\u2022 our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected;\n\u2022 our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired;\n\u2022 our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality, product architecture, legal or tax contingencies, customer obligations and product development, among other things;\n\u2022 as successor we may be subject to certain liabilities of our acquisition targets; and\n\u2022 we may be required to sustain significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful. Our failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition would adversely affect the benefit of such transaction, including potential synergies or sales growth opportunities, in the time frame anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur common stock has been publicly traded since September 2005 and we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially.\nThere has been a public market for our common stock since September 2005. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under \"-Risks Related to Our Business,\" \"-Risks Related to Regulation of Our Industry\" \"-Risks Related to the Merger\" and the following:\n\u2022 our failure to maintain our current customers, including because of consolidation in the gaming industry;\n\u2022 increases in commissions paid to gaming establishments as a result of competition;\n\u2022 increases in interchange rates, processing fees or other fees paid by us;\n\u2022 decreases in reverse interchange rates paid to us;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors' revenue, operating results or growth rate;\n\u2022 our inability to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 any adverse results in litigation initiated by us or by others against us;\n\u2022 our inability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness as they become due or our inability to undertake actions that might otherwise benefit us based on the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the notes;\n\u2022 the loss, or failure, of a significant supplier or strategic partner to provide the goods or services that we require from them;\n\u2022 our inability to introduce successful, new products and services in a timely manner or the introduction of new products or services by our competitors that reduce the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022 our failure to successfully enter new markets or the failure of new markets to develop in the time and manner that we anticipate;\n\u2022 announcements by our competitors of significant new contracts or contract renewals or of new products or services;\n\u2022 changes in general economic conditions, financial markets, the gaming industry or the payments processing industry;\n\u2022 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 sales of common stock or other actions by our current officers, directors and stockholders;\n\u2022 acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022 future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022 the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022 our failure to meet the revenue, net income or earnings per share estimates of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 terrorist acts, theft, vandalism, fires, floods or other natural disasters; and\n\u2022 rumors or speculation as to any of the above which we may be unable to confirm or deny due to disclosure restrictions imposed on us by law or which we otherwise deem imprudent to comment upon.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of additional shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders or the perception that these sales could occur.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares, or options to purchase additional shares, to our employees, directors and consultants, in connection with corporate alliances or acquisitions and in follow-on offerings to raise additional capital. Based on all of these factors, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, future sales of our common stock by our stockholders could make it more difficult for us to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities in the future.\nSome provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nSome provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging, or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or a change in our management or our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u2022 divide our Board of Directors into three separate classes serving staggered three-year terms, which will have the effect of requiring at least two annual stockholder meetings instead of one, to replace a majority of our directors, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or management;\n\u2022 provide that special meetings of stockholders can only be called by our Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the business permitted to be conducted at any special meeting of stockholders is limited to the business specified in the notice of such meeting to the stockholders;\n\u2022 provide for an advance notice procedure with regard to business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders which may delay or preclude stockholders from bringing matters before a meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at a meeting of stockholders, which could delay or deter takeover attempts or changes in management;\n\u2022 eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent so that all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting;\n\u2022 provide that directors may only be removed for cause with the approval of stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled by a majority, although less than a quorum, of directors in office and that our Board of Directors may fix the number of directors by resolution;\n\u2022 allow our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock and that otherwise could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights and the right to approve or not to approve an acquisition or other change in control, of the holders of common stock, without any further vote or action by the stockholders; and\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting for our directors, which may make it more difficult for stockholders owning less than a majority of our stock to elect any directors to our Board of Directors. In addition, we are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides, subject to enumerated exceptions, that if a person acquires 15% or more of our voting stock, the person is an\n\"interested stockholder\" and may not engage in \"business combinations\" with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired 15% or more of our voting stock.\nThese provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive our stockholders of the opportunity to sell shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90885, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "EVRI"}
