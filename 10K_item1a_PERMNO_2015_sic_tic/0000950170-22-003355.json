{"cik": "69488", "company": "MYERS INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\tRisk Factors\nThis Form 10-K and the information we are incorporating by reference contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including information regarding the Company\u2019s financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects and anticipated financial performance. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d or variations of these words, or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, these statements inherently involve a wide range of inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. The Company\u2019s actual actions, results, and financial condition may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Specific factors that could cause such a difference include those set forth below and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. Given these factors, as well as other variables that may affect our operating results, you should not rely on forward-looking statements, assume that past financial performance will be a reliable indicator of future performance, nor use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. We expressly disclaim any obligation or intention to provide updates to the forward-looking statements and the estimates and assumptions associated with them.\nRisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the applicable statements include, but are not limited to:\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nFirst identified in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) became a global pandemic and has spread rapidly to other areas of the world, including our primary markets. Regulatory actions in response to COVID-19 have varied across jurisdictions and have included closure of nonessential businesses. While the effects from the pandemic appear to have improved compared to 2020, the duration and extent of these measures put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 remain unknown, including possible reimplementation of any measures that have been removed or relaxed. Through the date of this report, most of the Company\u2019s businesses are considered essential because they supply food and agricultural, automotive, healthcare, industrial and consumer end markets. Accordingly, those businesses have continued to operate, other than temporary closures in March and April 2020 of certain manufacturing facilities in the Material Handling Segment and our Distribution business in Central America. Beyond the impact of these temporary closures, some of our businesses have been and may continue to be affected by the broader economic effects from COVID-19 and related regulatory actions, including customer demand for our products, supply chain disruptions and labor availability. While we have so far been able to source required materials and products at reasonable cost, the pandemic may affect our supply chain in ways that are beyond our control. We may also incur costs or experience further disruption to comply with new or changing regulations in response to the pandemic.\nThe overall magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its direct and indirect impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity continues to be inherently uncertain. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the outbreak duration and severity of new variants of COVID-19; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the availability, distribution, effectiveness and community acceptance of vaccines; and the pace of economic recovery, particularly in our end markets, when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nSignificant increase in the cost of raw materials or disruption in the availability of raw materials could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to manage our cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices. Our primary raw materials include plastic resins, colorants, steel and natural and synthetic rubbers. Plastic resins in particular are subject to substantial short-term price fluctuations, including those arising from supply shortages and changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other petrochemical intermediates from which resins are produced, as well as other factors such as production interruption created by extreme weather conditions. Over the past several years, we have at times experienced rapidly increasing resin prices. The Company\u2019s revenue and profitability may be materially and adversely affected by these price fluctuations.\nMarket conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our raw material input costs. If we are unsuccessful in developing ways to mitigate raw material cost increases, we may not be able to improve productivity or realize our ongoing cost reduction programs sufficiently to help offset the impact of these increased raw material costs. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nRaw material availability is subject to the risk of our suppliers\u2019 ability to supply products to us, which could be affected by the suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain raw materials due to material or labor shortages or labor disputes or strikes. Changes in raw material availability may also occur due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, such as the severe winter storm and freezing conditions in and near Texas in February 2021. Our specific molding technologies and/or product specifications can limit our ability to timely locate alternative suppliers to produce certain products. This can occur when there are limited suppliers of certain grades of plastic resins, where the market supply can be temporarily disrupted by an unanticipated loss of capacity from any one such supplier.\nIn some instances, we rely on a limited number of key suppliers to manufacture custom made components for certain of our products using proprietary molds that we own. We have not and do not expect disruption from these key suppliers, and our sourcing team has taken measures to mitigate this risk. However, if suppliers of these custom made components are unable to meet our requirements, fail to make shipments in a timely manner, or ship defective components, we could experience a shortage or delay in supply or fail to meet our customers' demand, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in trade policies could result in new tariffs or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced, directly or indirectly, from foreign countries, which could increase raw material costs and adversely impact profitability. However, as the Company has limited foreign operations and sources much of its raw materials domestically, we do not believe new tariffs would have a material impact on our operations. We also believe that adverse impacts can be mitigated over time through increases in price or sourcing through an alternate supply chain.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBoth of our segments participate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality and performance, value, and supply chain competency. Our competitive success also depends on our ability to maintain strong brands, customer relationships and the belief that customers will need our solutions to meet their growth requirements. The development and maintenance of such brands require continuous investment in brand building, marketing initiatives and advertising. The competition that we face in all of our markets - which varies depending on the particular business segment, product lines and customers - may prevent us from achieving sales, product pricing and income goals, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOngoing industry consolidation continues to create competitors with greater financial and other resources. Competitive pressures may require us to reduce prices and attempt to offset such price reductions with improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, for which options may be limited or unavailable. Additionally, larger competitors may be better positioned to weather prolonged periods of reduced prices, which may incentivize them to reduce prices even when not dictated by market and competitive conditions.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain continuous, uninterrupted production at our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nWe are subject to inherent risks from our diverse manufacturing and distribution activities, including but not limited to product quality, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, environmental events, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, disruptions in logistics and transportation services, labor disputes and industrial accidents. While we maintain insurance covering our manufacturing and production facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, natural disaster or any other reason, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment, machinery and manufacturing processes may also result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to offset the lost revenues or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption of our operations. A temporary or long-term business disruption could result in a permanent loss of customers. If this were to occur, our future sales levels, and therefore our profitability, could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we depend on skilled labor in the manufacturing of our products. High demand for skilled manufacturing labor in the United States has resulted in difficulty hiring, training, and retaining labor in a tightening labor market. Difficulties in securing skilled labor can result in increased hiring and training costs, increased overtime to meet demand, and increased wage rates to attract and retain workers, and lower manufacturing efficiency due to fewer and less experienced workers which could adversely affect our business or our ability to meet customer demand.\nOur future performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new products if there are changes in technology, regulatory requirements or competitive processes.\nChanges in technology, regulatory requirements and competitive processes may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our performance in the future will depend in part on our ability to develop and market new products that will gain customer acceptance and loyalty, as well as our ability to adapt our product offerings and control our costs to meet changing market conditions. Our operating performance would be adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products or if such products did not gain market acceptance. There can be no assurance that existing or future products will be sufficiently successful to enable us to effectively compete in our markets or, should new product offerings meet with significant customer acceptance, that one or more current or future competitors will not introduce products that render our products noncompetitive.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Additionally, in the future we may license patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights are protected when entering into business relationships, third parties may take actions that could materially and adversely affect our rights or the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.\nOur business operations could be adversely affected if we lose key employees or members of our senior management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key employees and senior management team. Our senior management team has extensive marketing, sales, manufacturing, finance and engineering experience, which we believe is instrumental to our continued success. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel who have experience in the application of our products and are knowledgeable about our business, markets and products. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or other key employees or attract additional qualified personnel when needed, and we may modify our management structure from time to time or reduce our overall workforce, which may create marketing, operational and other business risks. The loss of key employees or executive officers in the future could adversely impact our business and operations, including our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans, expansion of services, marketing and other objectives.\nRisks Relating to the Execution of Our Strategy\nOur strategic growth initiatives have inherent risks and may not achieve anticipated benefits.\nOur growth initiatives include:\n\u2022Organic growth driven by strong brands and new product innovation;\n\u2022Development of new, high-growth markets and expansion in existing niche markets;\n\u2022Strengthened customer relationships through value-added initiatives and key product partnerships;\n\u2022Investments in new technology and processes to reinforce market strength and capabilities in key business groups;\n\u2022Consolidation and rationalization activities to further reduce costs and improve productivity within our manufacturing and distribution footprint;\n\u2022An opportunistic and disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth in our market positions; and\n\u2022Potential divestitures of businesses with non-strategic products or markets.\nWhile this is a continuous process, all of these activities and initiatives have inherent risks and there remain significant challenges and uncertainties, including economic and general business conditions that could limit our ability to achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced strategic initiatives and affect our financial results. We may not achieve any or all of these goals and are unable to predict whether these initiatives will produce significant revenues or profits.\nWe may not realize the improved operating results that we anticipate from past acquisitions, including Trilogy, or from acquisitions we may make in the future, and we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses or may inherit significant liabilities related to such businesses.\nWe explore opportunities to acquire businesses that we believe are related to the execution of the Company\u2019s long-term strategies, with a focus on, among other things, alignment with the Company\u2019s existing technologies and competencies, flexible operations, and leadership in niche markets. Some of these acquisitions may be material to us. We expect such acquisitions will produce operating results consistent with our other operations and our strategic goals; however, we may be unable to achieve the benefits expected to be realized from our acquisitions. In addition, we may incur additional costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted because of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other risks inherent in acquiring businesses, including the following:\n\u2022We may have difficulty integrating the acquired businesses as planned, which may include integration of systems of internal controls over financial reporting and other financial and administrative functions;\n\u2022We may have delays in realizing the benefits of our strategies for an acquired business;\n\u2022The increasing demands on our operational systems and integration costs, including diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may be greater than anticipated;\n\u2022We may not be able to retain key employees necessary to continue the operations of an acquired business;\n\u2022Acquisition costs may be met with cash or through increased debt, increasing the risk that we will be unable to satisfy current and future financial obligations; and\n\u2022Acquired companies may have unknown liabilities that could require us to spend significant amounts of additional capital.\nRisks Relating to Economic Conditions and Currency Exchange Rates\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by a downturn or inflationary conditions in the United States economy or global markets.\nWe operate in a wide range of regions, primarily in North America. Additionally, some of our end markets are cyclical, and some of our products are a capital expense for our customers. Worldwide and regional business and political conditions and overall strength of the worldwide, regional and local economies, including changes in the economic conditions of the broader markets and in our individual niche markets, could have an adverse effect on one or both of our operating segments.\nInflationary economic conditions in North America and the other regions in which we operate could adversely impact the cost of labor, and commodity and other raw material prices. Market conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increased costs and prices caused by inflation. To the extent we are not able to offset increased costs and prices caused by inflation we may not be able to maintain current margins and operating results.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales outside the United States and are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe currently operate manufacturing, sales and service facilities outside of the United States, particularly in Canada and Central America. For the year ended December 31, 2021, international net sales accounted for approximately 6% of our total net sales. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022Limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022Limitations on foreign investment;\n\u2022Additional costs of compliance with local regulations; and\n\u2022In certain countries, higher rates of inflation than in the United States.\nIn addition, our operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. The costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt and Capital Structure\nIf we are unable to maintain access to credit financing, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make payments on or refinance our indebtedness, fund planned capital expenditures, finance acquisitions and pay dividends depends on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow and retain access to credit financing. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service debt, make necessary capital expenditures or fund other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur current credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios, and our ability to satisfy those requirements may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of those financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in a default and upon such a default the lenders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. We cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated.\nEquity Ownership Concentration\nBased solely on the Schedule 13D/A filed on April 6, 2021, by Mario J. Gabelli, Gabelli Funds, LLC, GAMCO Asset Management Inc., MJG Associates, Inc., Teton Advisors, Inc., Gabelli Foundation, Inc., GGCP, Inc., GAMCO Investors, Inc., Associated Capital Group, Inc. and Gabelli & Company Investment Advisors, Inc., (collectively, the \u201cGamco Group\u201d), for which the Company disclaims any responsibility for accuracy, the Gamco Group beneficially owned 5,671,317 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 15.6% of the 36,262,259 shares outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nBased solely on the Schedule 13G/A filed on January 27, 2022, by Blackrock, Inc., (\u201cBlackrock\u201d), for which the Company disclaims any responsibility for accuracy, Blackrock beneficially owned 5,736,819 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 15.8% of the 36,262,259 shares outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nIndividually or combined, these parties may have sufficient voting power to influence actions requiring the approval of our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Information Security\nOur information technology systems have in the past and may experience an interruption or a breach in security.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized intrusion, and other events, any of which could interrupt our business operations. While we have implemented security measures designed to prevent and mitigate the risk of breaches, information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cybersecurity attacks. A failure in or a breach of security in our information technology systems could expose us, our customers and our suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could negatively affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, because the techniques used to carry out cybersecurity attacks change frequently and in many instances are not recognized until after they are used against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these changes or implement adequate preventative measures.\nChanges in privacy laws, regulations and standards may negatively impact our business.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States and in many other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy which may require us to incur significant compliance costs. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations could result in significant cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our sales and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nFuture claims, litigation and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nThe nature of our business exposes us, from time to time, to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, claims for negligence, or product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage claims. We strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements and that our products perform effectively and safely; however, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet contractual requirements, and users could be harmed by use or misuse of our products. This could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. Such claims can be expensive to defend or address and may divert the attention of management for significant time periods. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance coverage, such coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances and claims may increase the cost of such insurance coverage. In addition, claims may arise related to patent infringement, environmental liabilities, distributor terminations, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law, employment law and employee benefits issues and other regulatory matters. While we have in place processes and policies to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict the underlying costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nCurrent and future environmental and other governmental laws and requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the handling, use, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous wastes and other materials and require clean-up of contaminated sites. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and periodically may be subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines, penalties and other civil or criminal sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. Certain environmental laws in the United States, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 et seq. (\u201cCERCLA\u201d or \u201cSuperfund law\u201d) and similar state laws, impose liability for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites upon the current or, in some cases, the former site owners or operators (or their predecessor entities) and upon parties who arranged for the disposal of wastes or transported or sent those wastes to an off-site facility for treatment or disposal, regardless of when the release of hazardous substances occurred or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the release. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation.\nWhile we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict with any certainty our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about, including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, or at sites formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors in connection with discontinued operations, could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material.\nAs more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, we are a potentially responsible party (\u201cPRP\u201d) in an environmental proceeding and remediation matter in which substantial amounts may be involved. It is possible that adjustments to reserved expenses will be necessary as new information is obtained, including after EPA approval of the work plan for the remedial investigation and feasibility study (\u201cRI/FS\u201d), which is anticipated to occur in 2022. Estimates of the Company\u2019s liability are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. Estimates of the Company\u2019s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluation and cost estimates, the extent of remedial actions that may be required, the extent of oversight by the EPA, the number and financial condition of other PRPs that may be named as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation, and the availability of insurance coverage for these expenses. At this time, we have not accrued for such remediation costs as we are unable to estimate the liability at this time. Additionally, we are party to a consent decree regarding another location pursuant to which we are required to contribute to the costs of the remediation project.\nWe have limited insurance coverage for potential environmental liabilities associated with historic and current operations and we do not anticipate increasing such coverage in the future. We may also assume significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Such costs or liabilities could adversely affect our financial situation and our ability to conduct our business.\nEnvironmental regulations specific to plastic products and containers could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nFederal, state, local and foreign governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of plastic and other containers, and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and other legislative bodies. While container legislation has been adopted in a few jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda in several states, local elections and many state and local legislative sessions. There can be no assurance that future legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, a decline in consumer preference for plastic products due to environmental considerations could have a negative effect on our business.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect against potential hazardous incidents to our business.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, product liability and casualty insurance coverage, but such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims, including losses resulting from war risks, terrorist acts, whether domestic or foreign, or product liability claims relating to products we manufacture. Consistent with market conditions in the insurance industry, premiums and deductibles for some of our insurance policies have been increasing and may continue to increase in the future. In some instances, some types of insurance may become available only for reduced amounts of coverage, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurers would not challenge coverage for certain claims. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured or that our insurers disputed, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in laws and regulations may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nChanges in laws and regulations and approvals and decisions of courts, regulators, and governmental bodies on any legal claims known or unknown, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. Additionally, changes in tax laws, particularly in light of changes in the composition of Congress, or new guidance or directives issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could impact our future effective tax rate and may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nExposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s 2017. U.S. Federal tax return is currently under audit by the IRS. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcome of the audit in order to determine the appropriateness of its tax provision, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of the audit and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of the audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the Company\u2019s income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on its tax provision, net income and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nInternal control systems are intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these internal control deficiencies. If we have an internal control deficiency and our remedial measures are insufficient, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could be discovered or occur in the future, and our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements. See Item 9A - Controls and Procedures for further discussion.\nUnforeseen events, including natural disasters, unusual or severe weather events and patterns, public health crises, geopolitical crises, and other catastrophic events may negatively impact our economic condition.\nFuture events may occur that would adversely affect our business. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, a material adverse change in our relationship with significant customers, natural disasters, unusual or severe weather events or patterns, public health crises, geopolitical, or other catastrophic events beyond our control. Any of these events may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, whether by disrupting our operations or critical systems, adversely affecting the facilities of our suppliers, or other third-party providers, or customers. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact customer spending or trends in our end markets in impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results.", "PERMNO": 65365, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "MYE"}
