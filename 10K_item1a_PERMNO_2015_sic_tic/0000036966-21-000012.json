{"cik": "36966", "company": "FIRST HORIZON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact our operating results or financial condition. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure.\nThis Item highlights risks that could impact us in material ways by causing future results to differ\nmaterially from past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time. However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict all potential developments that could materially affect our financial performance or condition.\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nTABLE OF ITEM 1A TOPICS\nWe are subject to intense competition for clients, and the nature of that competition is changing quickly. Our primary areas of competition include: consumer and commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning and wealth management, fixed income products and services, title insurance services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve in our markets. The emergence of non-traditional, disruptive service providers (see Industry Disruption beginning on page 28) has intensified the competitive environment.\nSome competitors are traditional banks, subject to the same regulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation.\nExamples of less-regulated activities include check-cashing services, independent ATM services, and \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d lending, where investors provide debt financing and/or capital directly to borrowers.\nWe expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for clients, refer to Competition within Item 1 beginning on page 13 of this report.\nWe compete for talent. Our most significant competitors for clients also tend to be our most significant competitors for top talent. See Operational Risks beginning on page 30 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.\nWe compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets. See Liquidity and Funding Risks beginning on page 39 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our commercial and consumer banking businesses and our fixed income business. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions change, in 2021 our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking businesses as we integrate the businesses and operations of First Horizon and IBKC, and seek to exploit opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. Organic growth, including exploitation of revenue synergies, is expected to be coordinated with a focus on strong and stable returns on capital.\nOrganically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southern U.S. markets with similar characteristics, and expanded with specialty commercial lending and private client banking.\nIn the future, we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth. We may pursue acquisitions or strategic transactions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves.\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nFailure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful organic growth would adversely affect our business and earnings. We believe that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements, including:\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain clients in our banking market areas, particularly as we integrate First Horizon and IBKC;\n\u2022our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;\n\u2022our ability to maintain a high level of client service while optimizing our physical banking center count due to changing client demand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;\n\u2022our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions; and\n\u2022our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolving regulatory environment.\nWe have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.\nFailure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful business acquisitions would adversely affect our business and earnings. In relation to the IBKC merger and the 30-branch acquisition closed in 2020, and to the extent we engage in future bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various additional risks, including:\n\u2022our ability to realize planned strategic and tactical objectives, including operating efficiencies and revenue synergies, within a reasonable time period after closing the transaction;\n\u2022our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;\n\u2022our ability to properly evaluate loss inherent in the target business\u2019 loan portfolios;\n\u2022our ability to integrate the acquired business\u2019 operations, clients, and properties quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u2022our ability to manage cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions, which can be an often-overlooked and often-critical failure point in mergers;\n\u2022our ability to combine the franchise values of the two companies without significant loss from re-branding and other similar changes; and\n\u2022our ability to retain core clients and key associates.\nA type of strategic acquisition-a so-called \u201cmerger of equals\u201d where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value-presents unique opportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks, which continue to be present in relation to the IBKC transaction, include:\n\u2022the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time; and\n\u2022the potential for a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized or substantial revenue synergies can be developed effectively.\nThrough technological innovations and changes in client habits, the manner in which clients use financial services continues to change at a rapid pace. We provide a large number of services remotely (online and mobile), and physical banking center utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has weakened traditional geographic and relationship ties, and has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas.\nThrough digital marketing and service platforms, many banks are making client inroads unrelated to physical presence. This competitive risk is especially\npronounced from the largest U.S. banks, and from online-only banks, due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms.\nCompanies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible traditionally. Recently, some government leaders have discussed having the U.S. Post Office offer banking services.\nThe nature of technology-driven disruption to our industry is changing, in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nrather than merely enhance traditional services or their delivery. A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services.\nFor example, companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these \u201crobo-advisor\u201d services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent clients and potential clients, as well as persons interested in \u201cself-service\u201d investment management. Other industry changes, such as zero-commission trading offered by certain large firms able to use trading as a loss-leader, may amplify this trend.\nSimilarly, inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry, but also eventually may reduce the need for banks as secure deposit-keepers and intermediaries.\nWe believe that, over the course of the technology-driven evolution of our industry which is well underway, the \u201cwinners\u201d will be those institutions which can know their clients and make those clients feel they are known, even when many clients increasingly do not visit banking centers or have face-to-face live interaction. Two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such clients are (1) data management and analytics, using artificial intelligence processes, which allow an institution to provide a differentiated, personalized experience for the client at the point of interaction, and (2) seamless integration of real-time client contact with a human being through voice, chat, or other means.\nA critical factor in successful data analytics, allowing real-time differentiated interaction with clients, is how traditionally uncaptured, unstructured, or siloed data is acquired, managed, and accessed. Some banks are experimenting with different methods of addressing this business need, and more will follow. In addition, external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions. A basic challenge for all these efforts is how to integrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of\ndata and utilize that analysis in each client contact in a manner which most clients not only accept, but value.\nDeveloping workable proprietary solutions to the data analytics challenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation. Even with a substantial IT budget, we cannot outspend, or even come close to matching, the largest U.S. banking institutions. Therefore, like most U.S. banks, our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means, including those developed by external vendors. Our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the client\u2019s differentiated experience with us by recognizing and responding to client needs.\nTechnological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entry based on cost. Put another way, once someone finds a new, better method to accomplish a task in our industry, often others are able to replicate or improve on that method, sometimes quite rapidly. Key risks for us, therefore, are whether we will be able: to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid client attrition; to adopt and enhance breakthroughs frequently enough, and without significant technical failures, to attract clients from competitors; and, if we are able to truly innovate, to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it.\nTo thrive as our industry is disrupted, we will need to embrace some of the attitudes of a technology company, and shed some of the attitudes of a traditional bank. This has required, and will continue to require, an evolution in our corporate culture which, in turn, creates implementation risk. In this process it is critical that we not lose sight of how our clients experience working with us and our systems, including those clients who still want traditionally-delivered services, those who seek and embrace the latest innovations, and those who just want services to be convenient, personalized, and understandable.\nJust as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new client preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events can adversely impact our commercial clients. In time, a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire lines of business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores, and the rise of Netflix and similar services. Many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, including publishing, retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment. To the extent disruptions impact our\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nclients, we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new clients.\nFraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk for us and all banks. Two traditional areas, deposit fraud (check kiting, wire fraud, etc.) and loan fraud, continue to be major sources of fraud attempts and loss. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes. In addition to cybersecurity risk (discussed below), new technologies have made it easier for bad actors to obtain and use client personal information, mimic signatures, and otherwise create false documents that look genuine.\nOur anti-fraud actions are both preventive (anticipating lines of attack, educating associates and clients, etc.) and responsive (remediating actual attacks). Our regulators require us to report fraud promptly, and regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible. However, some level of fraud loss is unavoidable, and the risk of a major loss cannot be eliminated.\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by associates or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make systems more robust may make them less adaptable, and vice-versa. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain client service and compliance at high quality and low cost.\nA serious information technology security (cybersecurity) breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of\nour funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on clients, or adverse publicity associated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be associates, clients, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems must comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and client protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our associates to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our clients as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.\nThe operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to obtain an alternate vendor quickly. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks may become more difficult.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recent years a number of major U.S. consumer-oriented firms experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millions of clients. These incursions affected cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in third-party incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our clients. Our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include retailers, utilities, insurers, health care service\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nproviders, internet service and electronic mail providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nFailure to build and maintain, or outsource, the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to clients, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 91 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).\nThe delivery of financial services to clients and others increasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement.\nCompetition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover, revenue growth in some\nbusiness lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In recent years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top revenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively.\nIncentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changes in our business. A poorly designed incentive program-where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desired outcomes-could provide little useful motivation to key associates, could increase turnover, and could impact client retention. Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, a program focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues.\nGenerally, in an economic downturn, our realized credit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and realized credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for clients and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other\nfinancial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employment rates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends.\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve. These strategies have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business and on many of our clients. In response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series\nof domestic monetary initiatives designed to lower rates and make credit easier to obtain. The Federal Reserve changed course in 2015, raising rates several times through 2018. The last raise in 2018 was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline. In 2019 the Federal Reserve began to lower rates. In 2020, in response to economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nthe Federal Reserve quickly reduced short-term rates to extremely low levels and acted to influence the markets to reduce long-term rates as well. For 2021, the Federal Reserve has indicated that future actions will depend upon changes in economic data.\nFederal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restrain economic activity.\nMany external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed, sometimes quickly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks beginning on page 40.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our clients, are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the U.S., especially in North and\nCentral America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our clients; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:\n\u2022our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;\n\u2022our ability to identify and implement key client, personnel, technology systems, and other transition\nactions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;\n\u2022our ability to mitigate the loss of any pretax income that the exited business produced;\n\u2022our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and\n\u2022our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain clients, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and\nunderstood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nprocesses for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.\nDamage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new clients and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented associates, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, also may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.\nPolitical and social fragmentation in the U.S., combined with access to social media platforms, can increase reputation risk in ways that might not be easily avoided by traditional means. The predominant culture within the banking industry remains traditional: in order to preserve their business reputations, banks generally prefer to avoid direct, public involvement in political or social controversy.\nIncreasingly, though, certain groups-having highly specific political or social agendas and with the ability to communicate their views effectively using social media platforms-have made it more difficult to maintain a traditional approach. One group, for example, may publicly criticize a bank for having, as a client, a business which \u201cexploits\u201d persons of limited financial means, while another group may criticize a bank for failing to have, as a client, the same business which \u201cserves\u201d such persons in neighborhoods that many businesses avoid. As another example, a group may demand that a bank cease doing business with a specific business client based on the client\u2019s industry or a specific business practice because that industry or practice, though legal, is objectionable to that group. While the potential for such demands has always existed, special interest groups today are more able and willing to publicize their criticisms, and some are willing to use factual exaggerations and inflammatory language in stating their views to the public. Those criticisms, in turn, ultimately may be acted upon by legislators or regulators.\nWe face the risk that our clients may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. In the last pre-COVID credit cycle, net charge-offs were $132 million in 2007, and increased to $573 million and $832 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $13 million by 2017 and remaining historically very low through 2019. In 2020, however, net charge-offs rose to $120 million, driven strongly by the COVID-induced recession starting in March.\nOur ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan clients and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate, among other things. We further manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan and lease losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty.\nWe record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption Accounting & Tax Risks beginning on page 44, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to be more volatile, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. In fact, as mentioned there, starting in 2020, such an accounting change was made and, when the COVID recession occurred starting in March, loan loss recognition was significantly accelerated. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators.\nA significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us.\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nThe recent low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments.\nWhen interest rates eventually rise, default risk likely also will rise. As borrowers\u2019 obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses generally become more evident. Initially this results in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading, and later results in higher default rates.\nRealized credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner, although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately. Through 2019 we and other U.S. banks experienced an extended period of very low credit losses.\nThe credit cycle was disrupted by COVID-19. Our expectation for losses in 2020 rose sharply with the COVID-19 pandemic and its recession, though in many cases actual losses have significantly lagged. Although economic impact may subside with the distribution of vaccines in 2021, there is significant risk that loan provisioning and eventual loss could be elevated for some time. In any case, we do not know what the new \u201cnormal\u201d loan loss levels will be once the impacts of the pandemic have fully ended, or what long-term impact the pandemic will have on the credit cycle. It is extremely difficult for banks, and for investors, to know when an uptick in credit loss is merely idiosyncratic or instead portends a major credit cycle change.\nRegulatory positions issued during the COVID-19 pandemic may mask the true extent of credit deterioration in certain groups of loans. For borrowers who qualify, loan payment deferrals and other events that normally would trigger default status are not treated as defaults by lenders or the credit bureaus. Temporarily, these positions may obscure credit quality deterioration in those loans.\nThe composition of our loans inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2020, approximately 57% of total loans and leases consisted of the commercial, financial, and industrial (C&I) portfolio, while approximately 20% consisted of the consumer real estate portfolio.\nThe largest component of the C&I portfolio at year end was loans to mortgage companies, a component which represented about 16% of the C&I portfolio at that time. The second largest component was loans to finance and insurance companies. As a result, approximately 26% of the C&I portfolio was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more\nsensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio.\nThe consumer real estate portfolio contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the portfolio.\n\u2022Product concentration. The consumer real estate portfolio consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit.\n\u2022Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 14% of the consumer real estate portfolio consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.\n\u2022Geographic concentration. At year end, about 66% of the consumer real estate portfolio related to clients in three states: Florida, Tennessee, and Louisiana.\nThe consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer clients and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.\nVolatility in the oil and gas industry can impact us. At year-end, approximately 3% of our total loans were directly related to the oil and gas industry. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, these businesses and their related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Significant oil-price volatility, such as that experienced in 2020, can and often does impact our overall business in this industry by increasing provisioning and charge-offs, and by reducing demand for loans. Another set of risks specific to that industry relate to environmental concerns, including the risks of increased regulation or other governmental intervention, and the risks of adverse changes in consumption habits or public perceptions generally.\nAdditional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the caption\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nAsset Quality beginning on page 70 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).\nWe provide a wide range of services to clients, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the client or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs,\ncompliance programs, and supervision processes. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management, beginning on pages 91 and 92, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, has adversely affected our ability to conduct normal business, has adversely affected our clients, and is likely to harm our businesses and future results of operations.\nIn late 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China, which quickly spread to most countries in the world. Starting in late February 2020, financial market volatility increased dramatically based on concerns that COVID-19, and the steps being undertaken in many countries to mitigate its spread, would significantly disrupt economic activity.\nIn March 2020, financial market volatility increased further, with several one-day stock market swings that resulted in significant market declines. Additionally, in March: market pricing deteriorated in virtually all sectors and asset classes except U.S. Treasury securities; the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic; the U.S. President declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a national emergency, allowing several federal disaster programs to be accessed by states and cities; many states and cities in the U.S. declared health emergencies, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and quarantines, prohibiting gatherings of more than a small number of people and ordering or urging most businesses and workplaces to close or operate on a very restricted basis; the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates and started a \u201cquantitative easing\u201d program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit; the effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates; and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation. Government actions in the U.S. have included loan programs administered by banks and other private-sector lenders, liquidity programs administered by the U.S. Treasury, and\nfavorable accounting and regulatory treatment (for lenders) of certain loan payment deferrals.\nDuring the summer of 2020, in the U.S. infection and hospitalization rates declined, and government restrictions on businesses and the public eased in many locales. Late in the year, a new strain of the virus was identified, while infection and hospitalization rates increased sharply, prompting many governments to re-impose earlier restrictions going into 2021.\nIn 2020 and early 2021, the economic effects of these and related actions and events in the U.S. included: large numbers of partial or full business closures; large numbers of people were furloughed or laid off; large increases in unemployment; large numbers of workers worked from home; and large numbers of consumers were unwilling to undertake significant discretionary spending. In addition, worldwide demand for oil fell, resulting in significant drops in oil prices and in the values of oil-related assets.\nWe are not able to predict the impact of these still-changing circumstances on our businesses in 2021, although we expect the overall impact to be less in 2021 than in 2020. The full extent of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other events beyond our control will depend on uncertain future developments, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of new COVID strains, the effectiveness of vaccines on existing and new strains, and further actions governments may take to slow the spread of the virus, treat the ill, distribute the vaccines, and assist affected businesses.\nIn addition, the pandemic has resulted in modest operational disruptions for us. Clients\u2019 physical access to banking centers has been restricted off and on in many markets, and many non-client-facing associates have worked largely on a remote basis. More significant disruptions in the future could\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nadversely impact our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. Our post-merger integration efforts may be delayed and adversely affected by the pandemic, and could become more costly.\nVaccines offer the hope of substantially ending the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 during 2021; however, the lead times needed for effective distribution to the U.S population, and for effective immunity to develop in those people who are inoculated, mean that economic disruption is likely to continue for a significant period this year. Vaccines, reportedly with unusually high effectiveness rates, have been developed and approved for the public in the U.S., and, early in 2021, are being distributed by the various states. Distribution in the U.S. is hampered by special equipment needed to transport and store the vaccine material at very cold temperatures. Other vaccines have been developed and are expected to be approved in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. The vaccines reportedly are not fully effective for five or six weeks after first being administered. Also, a few political and other prominent leaders at first publicly signaled doubt regarding the safety or efficacy of the vaccines. These and other similar factors make it difficult to predict when economic restrictions will\nsubstantially relax or end, or when a critical percentage of the population no longer will fear the pandemic.\nChanges in interest rates due to Federal Reserve actions and market forces, mentioned above, negatively impacted our net interest margin (a measure of the average profit margin applicable to lending). Interest rates should begin to normalize when economic conditions improve significantly, but the timing and degree of normalization cannot be predicted. Also, \u201cspreads\u201d (the difference between U.S. Treasury borrowing rates and private sector borrowing rates) widened in 2020. For post-COVID loans, wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression. However, pre-COVID spreads are fixed by the loan contracts based on pre-COVID pricing.\nOur clients and vendors have been adversely impacted by governmental and societal responses to COVID-19. Those impacts on clients reduced noninterest income, created downward loan migration (a reduction in loan-grading), and increased provision for credit losses.\nThe regulatory environment continues to be challenging. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. Our regulatory burdens, including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial.\nWe are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 18, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or\nprofitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways.\nThe following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.\nWe and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios. U.S. capital standards are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption Capital Adequacy starting on page 20. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions could include: reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock.\nAdditional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) in Item 1 of this report beginning on\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\npages 20 and 21, respectively; under the captions Capital, Capital Risk Management and Adequacy, and Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends beginning on pages 67, 91, and 97, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item); and under the caption Regulatory Capital in Note 13-Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 173 of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).\nLegal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from clients, associates, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty.\nTypically, we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legal claims until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. For most of our pending legal matters we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). Under that guidance, reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established. Moreover, many cases experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others our loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case.\nAdditional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption Pre-2009 Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 44 of this report; under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations, Repurchase Accrual Methodology, Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends, and Contingent Liabilities beginning on pages 95, 95, 97, and 101, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7); and under the caption Contingencies in Note 17-\nContingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 181 of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).\nPolitical dysfunction and volatility within the federal government, both at the regulatory and Congressional level, creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation, taxes, and the economy, any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance. Moreover, political conflict within and among branches of government, and within and among government agencies, can rise to a level where day-to-day functions could be interrupted or impaired.\nData privacy is becoming a major political concern. The laws governing it are new, and are likely to evolve and expand. Many non-regulated, non-banking companies have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. This situation has prompted governmental responses. Two prominent responses are the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients. Further general regulation to protect data privacy appears likely, and banking industry regulations might be enlarged as well.\nPublic expectations concerning corporate controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs in the future without a corresponding increase in revenue, could curtail some aspects of our business, or both. At present, environmental regulations do not require us to monitor the direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with building, operating, or maintaining our physical facilities, nor are we taxed or fined in relation to those emissions, because such gases generally are not considered to be pollutants under federal law. Changing expectations could pressure us to physically measure, monitor, and curtail direct emissions and to estimate indirect emissions or impacts, and eventually could result in legal requirements to take those actions or to pay for measured or estimated emissions. Whether or not legally required, any such actions that we take would increase our operating costs. In addition, such expectations could pressure us to discontinue business relationships with certain clients, or groups of clients, that have suboptimal reputations for emissions.\nAlthough currently no proposal has been published, future regulations could discourage us from lending to clients in certain industries judged to be environmentally high-risk, even if those elevated risk factors have a long time\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nhorizon or are speculative for other reasons. Changes of that sort could curtail our ability to pursue profitable business opportunities.\nOur ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term success, but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change-whether by acquisition, expansion, or contraction-additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things.\nWe manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.\nWe have also focused on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects\nrather than emphasizing revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returns on capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run.\nDespite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factors and market forces beyond our control.\nWe are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact the south-eastern and south-central U.S. states where we do most of our traditional banking business. If those regions of the U.S. were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanes in Florida, Louisiana, the Carolina coasts, or the Texas coast; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companies in middle Tennessee; and automotive industry plant closures.\nWe have international assets, mainly in the form of loans and letters of credit. Holding non-U.S.\nassets creates a number of risks: the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to clients, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed.\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nOur property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by insurers. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.\nA portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified.\nWe own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are\n\u201cgeneral account\u201d and others are \u201cseparate account.\u201d The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.\nWhen we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for the actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our associate health-insurance benefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased.\nLiquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity, or an increase in the cost of liquidity, may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2020 were met principally by deposits, by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets.\nDeposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If interest rates fall, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly.\nIn the past two years deposit rates have fallen, to remarkably low levels. Although stock market values have climbed (broadly speaking), deposit levels also have climbed. While difficult to explain definitively, it is possible that while a sizable portion of available capital holders are comfortable with risk, another sizable portion are highly risk-averse in light of the severe volatility experienced by the stock markets in 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nThe market among banks for deposits may be impacted by current capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Institutions with less than $100 billion of assets are not required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. At or above $100 billion, the requirement increases with size and certain activities. The largest banks, which must maintain the highest minimum ratio, may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are only lightly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nwe could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.\nWe also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets. In spring 2020, before we closed the IBKC merger, we issued and sold $150 million of preferred stock, along with a total of $1.3 billion of senior and subordinated notes. Presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control.\nA number of more general factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty\navailability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. Changes associated with LIBOR also may impact our funding ability; see Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks beginning on page 40.\nEvents affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit.\nOur credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding. Our holding company (the Corporation) and our Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2020, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and of the Bank as investment grade. The ratings outlook was stable from Moody\u2019s and from Fitch for both the Corporation and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nReductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold.\nReductions in our credit ratings could allow some counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Under our margin agreements, we are required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. At this time, only one counterparty has a defined trigger and collateral threshold which references the lower of Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC or Moody\u2019s ratings. If a credit rating downgrade had occurred as of December 31, 2020, the maximum specified additional collateral we would have been required to post would have been less than $1 million. Contracts with other counterparties do not have defined thresholds and FHN could be asked to post collateral of an undetermined amount based on changes in credit ratings and derivative value.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves\nborrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A considerable portion of our\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nfunding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a sizeable portion of our lending and investing is in medium-term and long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. In addition, our fixed income business tends to perform better when rates decline or markets are volatile, which tends to partially offset net interest margin compression.\nA flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve is a reflection of interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The yield curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates and long-term rates are nearly the same; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve is usually upward sloping (higher rates for longer terms). However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted (downward sloping), which has happened several times in the past few years. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business.\nWe appear to be at the extreme \u201ceasing\u201d end of the spectrum in terms of interest rate policy, with no clear timeline when \u201ctightening\u201d might resume; the uncertainties of the magnitude and timing of future rate actions could adversely affect us. The Federal Reserve eased substantially in 2020 in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, the Fed has provided other stimulus through open-market purchases of various bond asset classes and the introduction of several liquidity facilities. As a result, rates cannot move much lower without becoming negative. The Federal Reserve seems determined to begin normalizing rates only in response to significant and sustained economic improvement, maximum employment, and inflation consistent with longer-run goals. We cannot predict when those conditions will exist. Meanwhile, we believe that the current low-rate, low-margin environment will continue for some time. See Risks Associated with Monetary Events beginning on page 31 of this report for additional information.\nMarket-indexed deposit products are very sensitive to changes in short-term rates, and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes. If market rates rise, an increase in those deposit rates may be necessary before we are able to effect similar increases in loan rates.\nExpectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed income business. This risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.\nThe expected discontinuance of LIBOR as a viable benchmark rate may adversely affect our business and our operating results. In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In late 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cAdministrator\u201d for LIBOR) posted a consultation on definitive end dates for the publication of USD LIBOR in which certain USD LIBOR tenors may continue to be published in some form after 2021. The consultation feedback and response from the Administrator as well as domestic and foreign regulators is pending. As a result, it is unclear if any LIBOR tenors will continue to be published after 2021.\nAt this time, it is uncertain as to which reference rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. The uncertainty poses both idiosyncratic and system wide risk. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) is a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed to help ensure a successful transition from USD LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative. SOFR is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York but is not directly comparable to LIBOR and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments. Key differences between the two are: SOFR is based on secured lending, LIBOR is not; and SOFR historically has been published only as an overnight rate, while LIBOR is published in many short-term forward looking maturity tenors.\nSince SOFR is based on secured lending, it is generally considered a \u201crisk-free rate\u201d whereas LIBOR includes an implicit credit spread. There is no clear solution or market-accepted practice to fully address this first difference of SOFR from LIBOR.\nIn response to the second difference, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun to publish compounded average SOFR rates covering prior 30-, 90-, and 180-day periods. It remains unclear how the market will use this data.\nAnother potential alternative, the American Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cAMBERIBOR\u201d) Index which is\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nproduced by the American Financial Exchange, has gained some market acceptance, but it has been limited. It remains unclear if AMERIBOR will become widely accepted in future. Other new indices, spread adjustments, and methodologies are in development by various providers.\nSOFR may become the primary reference rate replacement for certain financial products such as derivatives and adjustable rate mortgages. However, there is no clear market leader in other products. Further, it is impossible to predict the effect on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans of adopting SOFR or another alternative.\nAs a lender, an owner of securities, or a contractual counterparty, our primary exposures to LIBOR are in variable-rate loans and in hedging transactions. We are not able to determine the impact on us that LIBOR discontinuance will have. The simplicity and long history of using LIBOR, the lack of a definite alternative, and the possibility that different alternatives ultimately may be used in different circumstances, means that LIBOR continues to be used in many new instruments.\nA few instruments issued by us, including certain series of preferred stock and certain trust preferred obligations, have floating rate terms based on LIBOR, or have fixed rates that later will convert to floating rate terms based on LIBOR. As mentioned above, it is not known how long LIBOR will continue in a workable form. We have risk that an adverse outcome of the LIBOR transition after the\nexpected discontinuation could increase our interest, dividend, and other costs relative to those instruments. We may not be able to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if LIBOR were to continue indefinitely, unchanged. Further, some of these contracts are governed under New York State law where pending legislation would directly impact how the post-LIBOR rate is set. Additional legislative actions, both existing and those that may come in the future, at the Federal and state level may impact these and other facilities in an undetermined manner.\nThe transition from LIBOR may impact our ability to use hedge accounting, which could impact us as a lender, a securities owner, a counterparty, or an issuer. However, accounting and tax agencies have issued preliminary guidance that may ease the transition. In late 2020, the International Swap Dealers Association (\u201cISDA\u201d) published the LIBOR Fallbacks Protocol as a proposed standardized methodology for LIBOR transition for derivatives contracts. The central clearing counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d) for derivatives, however, are currently considering an alternative methodology for LIBOR transition for cleared derivatives contracts which differs from the ISDA protocol in various respects. While the final outcome of this matter is uncertain at this time, the alternative methodology being considered by the CCPs, if finalized, may result in operational and accounting implications for our LIBOR transition process for derivatives contracts.\nThe trading securities inventories and loans held for sale in our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to clients, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with those assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities and loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Average fixed income trading securities (long positions) were $1.4 billion for 2020, $1.4 billion for 2019, and $1.6 billion for 2018. Average fixed income trading liabilities (short positions) were $457 million, $503 million, and $683 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Average loans held for sale in our fixed income business were $554 million, $485 million, and $563 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018. Additional information concerning these risks and our\nmanagement of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 88 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).\nDeclines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for clients. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.\nSignificant changes to the securities market\u2019s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nAn example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values. Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminish if the plan\u2019s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, and can grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but would also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs. We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with the expected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should slowly diminish over time.\nChanges in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating associate\npopulation and changes to the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable.\nOur hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; we hedge the risk of interest rate movements related to the gap between the time we originate mortgage loans and the time we sell them; and we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, in the last example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.\nHedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.\nWe have contractual risks from our mortgage business. Our traditional mortgage business primarily consists of helping clients obtain home mortgages which we sell, rather than hold, or which qualify for a government-guarantee program. The mortgage terms conform to the requirements of the mortgage buyers or government agencies, and we make representations to those buyers or agencies concerning conformity of each mortgage at origination. Although the buyers and agencies generally take the risk that a mortgage defaults, we retain the risk that our representations were materially incorrect. In such a case, the buyer or agency generally has the power to force us to take the loan back for its face value, or to make the buyer or agency whole for loss.\nSome government mortgage programs could impose penalties on us for misrepresentations at the time of obtaining benefits under the program. Penalties can be severe, up to three times the agency\u2019s loss. As a result, mortgage origination processes need to emphasize being thorough and correct, in compliance with all agency standards. Those processes tend to slow the mortgage lending\nprocess for clients, and increase the complexity of the paperwork.\nThe mortgage servicing business creates regulatory risks. Servicing requires continual interaction with consumer clients. Federal, state, and sometimes local laws regulate when and how we interact with consumer clients. The requirements can be complex and difficult for us to administer, especially if a client is having difficulty with the mortgage loan. Failure to follow the applicable rules can result in significant penalties or other loss for us.\nThe mortgage servicing business creates financial reporting valuation risks. Our contractual right to service a loan generally is viewed as an asset for financial reporting purposes. Servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value, which affects the gains recognized upon sale of the related loans. Thereafter, servicing rights are amortized and reviewed for impairment. The valuations of servicing rights are dependent upon a number of inputs and assumptions that require management judgment. If our servicing rights become large in relation to our overall size, especially in volatile times, the impact of\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nvaluation changes can be significant and difficult to predict.\nWe have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited in 2008, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, and claims of non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and related lending businesses. We retain the risk of liability to clients and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses.\nAdditional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of\nthem, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations beginning on page 95, and Contingent Liabilities beginning on page 101 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7); and under the captions Exposures from pre-2009 Mortgage Business and Mortgage Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability, both beginning on page 182 within Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length, for example the valuation (or impairment) of our deferred tax assets. Estimates are made at specific points in time. As actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process.\nA significant merger or acquisition requires us to make many estimates, including the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities. With larger transactions, fair value and other estimations can take up to four quarters to finalize. These estimates, and their revisions, can have a substantial effect on the presentation of our financial condition and operating results after the transaction closes. In addition, the excess of the value \u201cpaid\u201d by us in the merger or acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to periodic impairment\nassessment, a process that can result in impairment expense which may be significant and sudden.\nChanges in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry.\nOne such accounting change, ASU 2016-13, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d substantially revised the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets, including most loans, in a manner that has substantially changed when and how we recognize loan loss. ASU 2016-13 was effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under ASU 2016-13, when we make or acquire a new loan, we are required to recognize immediately the \u201ccurrent expected credit loss,\u201d or \u201cCECL,\u201d of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarter that the loan is outstanding. CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods that incorporate macroeconomic forecasts and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the pre-2020 accounting standard delayed recognition until loss was \u201cprobable\u201d (very likely). We adopted ASU 2016-13 and CECL accounting starting in 2020, with the impact on regulatory capital having a phase-in period. Starting in 2020, recognition of estimated credit loss was significantly accelerated compared to pre-CECL practice, which was aggravated by the actual and projected effects of the pandemic. Additional information concerning ASU 2016-13 and its effects upon us appears in Note 1-Summary of\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nSignificant Accounting Policies within our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8), under the heading Summary of Accounting Changes beginning on page 135, and in Item 1 under the caption CECL Accounting and COVID-19 beginning on page 12, all of which information is incorporated into this Item 1A by reference.\nIn comparison with former (pre-2020) standards, CECL accounting likely will continue to: result in a significant increase in our provision for credit losses (expense) and allowance (reserve) during any period of loan growth, including organic growth and growth created by acquisition or merger; through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels; and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially during times when the economy is in transition or experiencing significant volatility. Moreover, once fully phased in, CECL creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the \u201cdown\u201d part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss recognition and conserve regulatory capital. That perverse incentive could,\nnationwide, prolong a down cycle in the economy and delay a recovery.\nChanges in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry, we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting standards. Changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures (\u201ccontrols and procedures\u201d) must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate. A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock, as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank may become unable to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval. First Horizon Corporation primarily depends upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints might constrain or prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2021 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, at January 1, 2021, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank's common or preferred stock of approximately $897 million without obtaining regulatory approval.\nAlso, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may need to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding\ncompany\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company\u2019s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nOur stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to stockholders in terms of voting power and share-of-ownership, and could be dilutive financially or economically.\nThe IBKC merger, for example, resulted in a significant increase in our outstanding shares. We issued to former IBKC shareholders common\nFIRST HORIZON CORPORATION\n2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT\nshares representing about 44% of our post-closing outstanding shares.\nOur issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares, but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends. Currently we have six series of preferred stock outstanding, one issued by the Bank and five by First Horizon Corporation. Subject to capital needs and market conditions, additional series may be issued in the future.\nProvisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. In addition, federal banking laws prohibit non-financial-industry companies from owning a bank, and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank.\nCertain legal rights of holders of our common stock and of depositary shares related to Series B, C, and D of our preferred stock to pursue claims against us or the depositary, as applicable, are limited by our bylaws and by the terms of the deposit agreements. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, a state or federal court located within Shelby County in the State of Tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in our right or name, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other associate of ours to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against\nus or any director, officer or other associate of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, of our charter or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other associate of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, each deposit agreement between us and the depositary, which govern the rights of the depositary shares related to our Series B, C, and D preferred stock, provide that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating in any way to the deposit agreement may only be brought in a state court located in the State of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nThe foregoing exclusive forum clauses may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors, officers or other associates, or against the depositary, as applicable. Exclusive forum clauses may also lead to increased costs to bring a claim, or may limit the ability of holders of our common stock or depositary shares to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable.\nIn addition, the exclusive forum clauses in our bylaws and deposit agreement could apply to actions or proceedings that may arise under the federal securities laws, depending on the nature of the claim alleged. To the extent these exclusive forum clauses restrict the courts in which holders of our common stock or depositary shares may bring claims arising under the federal securities laws, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. These exclusive forum provisions do not mean that holders of our common stock or depositary shares have waived our obligations to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.", "PERMNO": 36397, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FHN"}
