{"cik": "317889", "company": "Bulova Technologies Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could in turn materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur discontinued government contracting and contract manufacturing operations represented a significant portion of our operating revenues. There is no assurance our current business activity will sustain our operations.\nThe divestiture and discontinuation of the operations of BT Manufacturing Company LLC and Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC represented substantially all our revenues and assets at that time. While such discontinuances were deemed in our best interest because of the related reduction of substantial debts and liabilities, there is no assurance that our continuing operations will be successful.\nGovernment Contracts.\nWith the sale of substantially all of the assets of Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC in October 2012, Ordnance had only one remaining DoD contract (the BPA, which expired in October 2015) and at this time is not seeking additional work with DoD.\nIn addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, any backlog in Government contracts and future financial results may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of the U.S. Government\u2019s use of technology or other services and products providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in Iraq, Afghanistan or other geopolitical developments that affect demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain personnel to meet increasing demand for our services; and\n\u2022\ntechnological developments that impact purchasing decisions or our competitive position.\nGovernment contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification. If a termination right is exercised by the government, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompanies engaged primarily in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies are subject to certain business risks peculiar to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:\n\u2022\nsuspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts;\n\u2022\nreduce the value of existing contracts;\n\u2022\naudit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of our products.\nAll U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and various agency Inspectors\nGeneral routinely audit and investigate costs and performance on contracts, as well as accounting and general business practices of contractors. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust contract related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some costs, including most financing costs, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be reimbursable under U.S. Government contracts. We are currently involved, through Ordnance, in legal proceedings involving the termination of a DoD contract which took place in July 2011. (See Part 3, Legal Proceedings).\nWe may not be able to win competitively awarded contracts or receive required licenses to export our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nGovernment contracts are subject to competitive bidding. We obtain many of our U.S. Government contracts through a competitive bidding process. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts. In addition, awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in our profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the following:\n\u2022\nthe frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;\n\u2022\nthe substantial time, effort and experience required to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022\ndesign complexity and rapid technological obsolescence; and\n\u2022\nthe constant need for design improvement.\nIn addition to these U.S. Government contract risks, we are required to obtain licenses from U.S. Government agencies to export many of our products and systems. Additionally, we are not permitted to export some of our products to certain countries. Failure to receive required licenses would eliminate our ability to sell our products outside the United States.\nBrokerage of Small Caliber Ammunition Commercial Sales\nThe Brokerage business is dependent entirely upon both a strong U.S. demand and a lack of availability from U.S. manufacturers.\nWhile the demand for small caliber commercial ammunition has been especially strong in the past 2-4 years in the U.S. and remains so, there can be no assurance that the market will continue to remain so. Without such demand, sales would drop precipitously. Similarly, should U.S. manufacturers increase production to a greater level and meet the increased U.S. demand, the import of Eastern European ammunition would also likely be affected adversely.\nThe importation of ammunition manufactured abroad could be affected by future U.S. regulations.\nWhile Europe holds all licenses required to import ammunition from Eastern Europe, there can be no assurance that regulations might not be adopted in the future which could affect either the ability of Europe to import such ammunition or the price to Europe of such ammunition, in which case either Eastern European ammunition would become unavailable for import by Europe, or make such ammunition too costly to sell in the U.S.\nMachine Tool Business Commercial Sales\nBTM competes with much larger producers of machine tools products.\nThe machine tool product business is highly competitive and BTM competes against much larger entities with very strong resources and competitive pricing. There can be no assurance that BTM will succeed in its competition with such entities.\nThe machine tool business is subject to economic perturbations and foreign competition.\nWhile there are more than 196,000 machine shops in the U.S. which utilize machine tool equipment, the businesses utilizing machine tools and, consequently, the sellers of machine tool equipment in the U.S. are subject to general economic perturbations as well as foreign competition. Factors such as the demand for products manufactured by machine tool shops, the availability of credit to machine tool purchasers and the competition machine tool manufacturer\u2019s face from foreign manufacturers could adversely impact the sale of machine tools by BTM.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe are subject to the risks of current and future legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nAt any given time, we are a defendant in various material legal proceedings and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation, claims and assessments that have been asserted against acquired businesses, which we have assumed. Although we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims and these levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. We are currently involved, through Ordnance, in legal proceedings involving the termination of a DoD contract which took place in July 2011. (See Part 3, Legal Proceedings).\nIntense competition in the industries in which our businesses operate could limit our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe markets for defense products, machine tool sales and brokerage of commercial ammunition are each highly competitive. We expect that the DoD\u2019s continual adaptation to the needs driven by the instant wartime scenarios throughout the world, the military needs for products and components in military equipment will continue to encourage new competitors to enter the market. We also expect that competition for original equipment manufacturing business will increase due to the continued emergence of merchant suppliers. Additionally, many of our competitors are larger than we are and have more financial and other resources than we have.\nOur level of debt and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or ability to incur additional debt.\nCommencing with our January 1, 2009 acquisition of 3Si Holdings, Inc., we assumed certain amounts of indebtedness associated with the business operations acquired. Subsequently, we incurred additional debt with high interest rates that have hindered the Company financially. At September 30, 2015, we had approximately $8.3 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt related to continuing operations.\nIn October 2012, we sold substantially all of the assets of Bulova Technologies Ordnance Systems LLC, and settled significant indebtedness. In the future, we may need to increase our borrowings, subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Further discussion concerning the sale of these assets and any remaining scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt, is included in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\n.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to refinance our existing debt, including the scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt, depends on our future financial performance as well as our ability to access the capital markets, and the relative attractiveness of available financing terms. We do not have complete control over our future financial performance because it is subject to economic, political, financial (including credit market conditions), competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting the defense industry, as well as commercial industries in which we operate. It is possible that in the future our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If this situation occurs, we may have to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms in accordance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements.\nOur level of indebtedness has important consequences to us. These consequences may include:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our net cash flow from operations to be used to pay interest and principal on our debt and therefore be unavailable for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, paying dividends to our shareholders, repurchasing shares of our common stock, research and development and other investments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments or other expenditures, which, in each case, may limit our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy;\n\u2022\nincreasing interest expenses due to higher interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates;\n\u2022 heightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies and products or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nimpacting debt covenants that limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, or repurchase shares of our common stock. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.\nOur operations are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations.\nNew laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements may require us to incur a significant amount of additional costs in the future and could decrease the amount of free cash flow available to us for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development and other investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nTermination of our backlog of orders could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs described above, the U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or terminate its contracts. Accordingly, most of our backlog, if any, could be modified or terminated by the U.S. Government, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nGlobal economic recession, continued tightening of credit markets, and U.S. Government intervention in financial and other industries may adversely affect our results.\nDomestic and foreign economies and equity and fixed income markets have recently experienced significant declines, and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. These economic conditions are currently negatively impacting, and could continue to adversely affect, our sales to the commercial markets in which we operate, including our contract manufacturing business.\nAdditionally, while we are unable to predict the impact and outcome of these economic events and the U.S. Government\u2019s intervention to shore up financial and other industries, these events could also negatively affect future U.S. defense budgets and spending and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 77703, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "BTGI"}
