{"cik": "919012", "company": "AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nOur inability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends and fluctuations in customer demand in a timely manner could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and respond to fashion trends and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. The specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and customer preferences, dictated by fashion and season. These fluctuations can materially impact our sales and gross margins which is exacerbated by the fact that merchandise is typically ordered well in advance of the selling season. As a result, we are susceptible to changing fashion trends and fluctuations in customer demands.\nLead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand, pricing shifts and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases. Our failure to enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise in a timely manner could, among other things, lead to a shortage of inventory and lower sales. Changes in fashion trends, if unsuccessfully identified, forecasted or responded to by us, could, among other matters, lead to lower sales, excess inventories and higher markdowns, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we face significant pricing pressures from existing and new competitors.\nThe sale of apparel, accessories, intimates, and personal care products is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national, and international department stores, discount stores and online businesses. Changing consumer preferences has and may continue to result in new competition for our products. The substantial sales growth in the digital channel within the last several years has increased competition due to new entrants in the market and has resulted in pricing pressures from new entrants and established competitors. Some of these competitors have robust digital customer experiences and highly efficient delivery systems. Furthermore, the decrease in mall traffic is putting a greater reliance on the digital channel and thus increasing the competitive threat.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges, including:\n\u2022\nAnticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands or preferences better than our competitors;\n\u2022\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition and effective marketing of our products to consumers in several demographic markets;\n\u2022\nSourcing merchandise efficiently;\n\u2022\nDeveloping innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to our consumers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors;\n\u2022\nCountering the aggressive pricing and promotional activities of many of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nAnticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping.\nIn light of the competitive challenges we face, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and have lower market share. Additionally, increases in competition could reduce our sales, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effect of economic pressures and other business factors on discretionary consumer spending and changes in consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe success of our operations is highly dependent on consumer spending, which can be negatively impacted by economic conditions as well as factors affecting disposable consumer income such as income taxes, payroll taxes,\nemployment, consumer debt, interest rates, increases in energy costs and consumer confidence. We may be negatively impacted by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending habits such as consumer behavior reallocating to non-retail discretionary consumer spending.\nSeasonality may cause sales to fluctuate and negatively impact our results of operations.\nHistorically, our operations have been seasonal, with a large portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and year-end holiday selling seasons, respectively. Because of this seasonality, factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodeling\u2019s, competitive factors, weather and general economic and political conditions.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn late 2019, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending have led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. We continue to operate our e-commerce business, and had to temporarily close our corporate offices and American Eagle and Aerie physical stores. We have since reopened nearly all of our stores, but have had to operate at lower capacities than normal.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also directly threatens the health of our associates and customers. The operation of all of our stores is critically dependent on our associates who staff these locations. In the event that an associate tests positive for COVID-19, we have had to, and may in the future have to, temporarily close one or more stores, offices or distribution centers for cleaning and/or quarantine of one or more associates, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties that will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, any resurgences of COVID-19 in areas where our stores, customers, or associates are located, and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic, which could, among other things, require that we close our distribution and fulfillment centers or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to operate our e-commerce business. Numerous state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders and restrictions have resulted in temporary store closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions and cancellations of events, among other effects, thereby negatively impacting our operations. In addition, we expect to be impacted by a deterioration of economic conditions in the United States, which potentially could have an impact on discretionary consumer spending. To the extent that our target customer demographic is disproportionately impacted by unemployment or otherwise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business may be further adversely affected. The ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak to our business remain highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including changes in consumer behavior and traditions, changed mandated or recommended by government or health officials, and the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. While it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, we expect our results for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic to be adversely impacted in a significant manner.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, extreme cold events and other adverse weather conditions; public health crises (including, without limitation, the recent coronavirus outbreak), such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our licensees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In\nparticular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our licensees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers\u2019 perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nImpairment to goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets could adversely impact our profitability.\nSignificant negative industry or general economic trends, changes in customer demand for our product, disruptions to our business, and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our operating results or use of long-lived assets may result in impairments to goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.\nStrategic Risks\nOur inability to grow our digital channels and leverage omni-channel capabilities could adversely impact our business.\nWe have and expect to continue to make significant investments in building our technologies and digital capabilities in three key areas: mobile technology, digital marketing, and the digital customer experience. We have made significant capital investments in these areas but there is no assurance that we will realize a return on those investments or be successful in growing our digital channels.\nAs omni-channel retailing continues to evolve, our customers are increasingly more likely to shop across multiple channels that work in tandem to meet their needs. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. Our inability to respond to these changes and successfully maintain and expand our omni-channel business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFailure to define, launch and communicate a brand relevant customer experience could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nWe strive to build strong emotional connections with our customers and to enrich the customer experience. If our marketing and customer experience programs, including our loyalty program, are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our growth and profitability may be negatively affected.\nOur efforts to execute on our key business priorities could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to execute on our key priorities, which are centered on driving our brands forward and delivering an exceptional customer experience across channels, including:\n\u2022\nDouble Aerie to $2 billion in revenue.\n\u2022\nReignite American Eagle for profit growth.\nAs part of the plan, the Company will leverage customer-focused capabilities and continue to strengthen its ROI discipline, while building on the power of AEO\u2019s people, culture and purpose.\nAchieving these key business priorities depends on us executing our strategies successfully, and the initiatives that we implement in connection with these goals may not resonate with our customers. It may take longer than anticipated to generate the expected benefits of our initiatives, and there can be no guarantee that pursuing these key priorities will result in improved operating results or achievement of a given priority. Misalignment and competing initiatives could result in inefficiencies, erroneously prioritized efforts, and resource dilution. Failure to implement our key business priorities successfully could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOur efforts to expand internationally expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries.\nWe are actively pursuing additional international expansion initiatives, which include Company-owned stores and stores operated by third parties through licensing arrangements in select international markets. The effect of international expansion arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally. Furthermore, although we provide store operation training, literature and support, to the extent that a licensee does not operate its stores in a manner consistent with our\nrequirements regarding our brand and customer experience standards, our business results and the value of our brand could be negatively impacted.\nA failure to implement our expansion initiatives properly, or the adverse impact of political or economic risks in these international markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have limited prior experience operating internationally where we face established competitors. In many of these locations, the real estate, labor and employment, transportation and logistics and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the locations where we have more experience. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ substantially, and as a result, sales of our products may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. Any differences that we encounter as we expand internationally may divert financial, operational, and managerial resources from our existing operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are increasingly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our revenue, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The instruments we may use to hedge certain foreign currency risks in the future may not succeed in offsetting all of the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.\nAs we pursue our international expansion initiatives, we are subject to certain laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nOur business depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to anticipate, identify, and respond to customers\u2019 demands, preferences, and fashion trends. In addition, the increasing use of social media platforms allows for rapid communication and any negative publicity related to the aforementioned concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Public perception about our products or our stores, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur inability to implement and sustain adequate information technology systems could adversely impact our profitability.\nWe regularly evaluate our information technology systems and are currently implementing modifications and/or upgrades to the information technology systems that support our business. Modifications include replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems, or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with operating, replacing, and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information and system disruptions. There is a risk that information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and/or promptly and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that, if any computer system failure, cyber-attack, or security breach occurs, it will be timely detected or sufficiently remediated. Furthermore, if our information technology systems are damaged, breached or cease to properly function for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of, or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or similar events, and if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm, and we may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMeasures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact our operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the government mandates implemented to control its spread, most of our corporate office associates are working remotely. If our associates are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including because of illness, quarantines, office closures, ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. Further, remote work arrangements may increase the risk of security incidents, data breaches or cyber-attacks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the operation of our business, damage to our reputation and any government-imposed penalty.\nOur inability to safeguard against security incidents with respect to our information technology systems could damage our reputation and adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our business, customers, and employees including credit card information, street addresses, and\nemail addresses. Attackers continuously enhance and evolve in their efforts to compromise our systems and websites. Such security incidents could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this proprietary or confidential information, random demands and potential liability. We have experienced cyber incidents, which have not had a material adverse impact on our business or required external notification and for which we have taken measures to prevent from reoccurring. However, we may experience security incidents in the future, potentially with more frequency and/or sophistication. We may not be able to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology we use to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues including intentional or inadvertent action or inaction of our employees or persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in security incident. Any security incident could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant financial exposure and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nWe may be exposed to risks and costs associated with the loss of customer information that would cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues.\nWe collect customer data, including encrypted credit card information, in our stores, at special events and online. For our sales channels to function successfully, we and third parties involved in processing customer transactions for us must be able to transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely over public networks. We cannot guarantee that any of our security measures or the security measures of third parties with whom we work will effectively prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 information. If such a breach were to occur, customers could lose confidence in our ability to secure their information and choose not to purchase from us. Any unauthorized access to customer information could expose us to data loss or manipulation, litigation and legal liability, and could seriously disrupt operations, negatively impact our marketing capabilities, cause us to incur significant expenses to notify customers of the breach and for other remediation activities, and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, state, federal, and foreign governments are increasingly enacting laws and regulations protecting consumers\u2019 privacy and personal information against identity theft and unwanted exposure. These laws and regulations likely will increase the costs of doing business. If we fail to implement appropriate security measures or fail to detect and provide applicable notice of unauthorized access (as required by some of these laws and regulations), we could be subject to potential governmental investigations, claims for damages, or other remedies, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur failure to manage growth in our omni-channel operations and the resulting impact on our distribution and fulfillment networks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn Fiscal 2020, digital sales represented 45% of our total revenue, a 36% increase compared to Fiscal 2019. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology to address the changing demands of our customers.\nOur omni-channel operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; and the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nOur failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. The satisfaction of our customers who shop online depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction.\nAny of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur international merchandise sourcing strategy subjects us to risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur merchandise is manufactured by suppliers worldwide. We purchase a significant portion of our merchandise through a single international buying agent. Because we have a global supply chain, any event that causes the disruption of imports, including the insolvency of a significant supplier, global health crisis, a major labor dispute including any such actions involving ports, trans loaders, consolidators, or shippers, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Given the volatility and risk in the current markets, our reliance on external vendors leaves us subject to certain risks should one or more of these external vendors become insolvent. The financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nTrade matters may disrupt our supply chain. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a Supplier Code of Conduct that provides guidelines for our vendors regarding working conditions, employment practices, and compliance with local laws. A copy of the Supplier Code of Conduct is posted on our website, www.aeo-inc.com, and is included in our vendor manual in English and multiple other languages. There can be no assurance that all violations can be eliminated in our supply chain. Publicity regarding violation of our Supplier Code of Conduct or other social responsibility standards by any of our vendor factories could adversely affect our reputation, sales, and financial performance.\nThere is a risk of terrorist activity on a global basis. Such activity might take the form of a physical act that impedes the flow of imported goods or the insertion of a harmful or injurious agent into an imported shipment. We cannot predict the likelihood of any such activities or the extent of their adverse impact on our operations.\nOur product costs may be adversely affected by foreign trade issues (including import tariffs and other trade restrictions with China), currency exchange rate fluctuations, increasing prices for raw materials, political instability, or other reasons, which could impact our profitability.\nA significant portion of the products that we purchase, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, as well as most of our private brand merchandise, is manufactured abroad. Foreign imports subject us to risks relating to changes in import duties, quotas, the introduction of U.S. taxes on imported goods or the extension of U.S. income taxes on our foreign suppliers' sales of imported goods through the adoption of destination-based income tax jurisdiction, loss of \"most favored nation\" status with the U.S., shipment delays and shipping port constraints, labor strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions, freight cost increases and economic uncertainties. Furthermore, we could face significantly higher U.S. income and similar taxes with respect to sales of products purchased from foreign suppliers if the U.S. were to adopt a system of taxation, such as a border adjustment tax, under which the cost of imported products was not deductible in determining such products' tax base. If such a tax system were adopted, we could also face higher prices for products manufactured or produced abroad that we purchase from our domestic suppliers if they were subject to such a tax. In addition, the U.S. government periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained by our vendors and us. General trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been high, with multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods implemented in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, China or other countries may institute retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future tariffs imposed by the U.S. that could have a negative impact on our business. If any of these events continue as described, we may need to seek alternative suppliers or vendors, raise prices, or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which our vendors' suppliers or our private brand products' manufacturers are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase. Additionally, we could be impacted by negative publicity or, in some cases, face potential liability to the extent that any foreign manufacturers from which we directly or indirectly purchase products utilize labor, environmental, workplace safety and other practices that vary from those commonly accepted in the U.S. or elsewhere. Also, the prices charged by foreign manufacturers may be affected by the fluctuation of their local currency against the U.S. dollar and the price of raw materials, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause the cost of our products to increase and negatively impact our sales or profitability.\nOur inability to achieve planned store performance, gain market share in the face of declining shopping center traffic or attract customers to our stores could adversely impact our profitability and our results of operations.\nThe results achieved by our stores may not be indicative of long-term performance or the potential performance of stores in other locations. Part of our future growth is dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. The failure of our stores to achieve acceptable results could result in store asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our real estate strategy may not be successful, and store locations may fail to produce desired results, which could impact our competitive position and profitability. Customer shopping patterns have been evolving from brick-and-mortar locations to, increasingly, digital channels. We have Company-owned stores in shopping centers that have experienced declining traffic trends while our digital channels continue to grow. Our ability to grow revenue and acquire new customers is contingent on our ability to drive traffic to both store locations and digital channels so that we are accessible to our customers when and where they want to shop.\nWe seek to locate our brick and mortar stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls or street locations. Our stores benefit from the ability of the malls\u2019 \u201canchor\u201d tenants, which generally are large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic near our stores. We cannot control the increasing impact of digital channels on shopping center traffic, the loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, the development of new shopping malls in the U.S. or around the world, the availability or cost of appropriate locations, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, or the success of individual shopping malls. All of these factors may\nimpact our ability to meet our productivity targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, some malls and shopping centers that were in prominent locations when we opened our stores may cease to be viewed as prominent. If this trend away from brick and mortar retail continues or if the popularity of mall shopping continues to decline generally among our customers, our sales may decline, which would impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant lease obligations, and are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs and the need to generate significant cash flow to meet our lease obligations.\nOperating lease obligations, which consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases, represent a significant contractual commitment. All of our stores are leased and generally have initial terms of 5-10 years. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate favorable lease terms for the most desired store locations. Our inability to do so may cause our occupancy costs to be higher in future years or may force us to close stores in desirable locations.\nCertain leases have early termination options, which can be exercised under certain specific conditions. In addition to future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for additional rental payments based on a percentage of net sales, or \u201cpercentage rent,\u201d if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels, as well as the payment of tenant occupancy costs, including maintenance costs, common area charges, real estate taxes and certain other expenses. Many of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, due to continued decreases in mall traffic, the highly competitive and promotional retail environment, or other factors, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially harm our business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our obligations under the leases increases our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions, and could limit our ability to fund working capital, incur indebtedness, and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business.\nWe rely on key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel, including senior management, and, in particular, Jay Schottenstein, our Executive Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Foyle, our Chief Creative Officer. Collective or individual changes in our senior management and other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to determine and execute our strategies, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. There is a high level of competition for senior management and other key personnel, and we cannot be assured we will be able to attract, retain, and develop a sufficient number of qualified senior managers and other key personnel.\nLegal, Tax, and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), or the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (iv) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the Company or any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware or (v) any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim,\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL shall, in each case, be the Delaware Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware).\nThe choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Company\u2019s Bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks, as described in Part 1, Item 1, Business, are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to establishing and protecting our trademarks and service marks. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Litigation regarding our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA complex regulatory, compliance and legal environment could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, including those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, competition, privacy, consumer protection, import/export and anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Additional legal and regulatory requirements have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment and the cost of compliance. If these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or employees, we could experience delays in shipments or receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business. Also, changes in laws and regulations could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. Our employees, subcontractors, vendors and suppliers could take actions that violate our policies and procedures which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.\nImpact of various legal proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (\u201cActions\u201d) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered only in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdditionally, other factors could adversely affect our financial performance, including factors such as: our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses; any interruption of our key infrastructure systems, including exceeding capacity in our distribution centers; any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution centers or in a large number of our stores; any interruption of our business related to an outbreak of a pandemic disease in a country where we source or market our merchandise; extreme weather conditions or changes in climate conditions or weather patterns; and the effects of changes in interest rates.\nThe impact of any of the previously discussed factors, some of which are beyond our control, and others which we are not aware of or which we do not currently consider material, may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations expressed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and other forward-looking statements we may make from time-to-time.", "PERMNO": 80432, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "AEO"}
