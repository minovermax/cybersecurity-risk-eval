Risk Factors.\nOur business and the businesses of our subsidiaries face many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries. We have described below the material risks facing us and our subsidiaries. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also impact our business or the businesses of our subsidiaries.\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC and the information we make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, also file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries with the SEC and the information they make available to the public before investing in any of their securities.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in significant risk across CNA\u2019s enterprise, which have had, and may continue to have, material adverse impacts on its business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, and actions seeking to mitigate the spread of the virus, accelerated in both breadth and scope through early 2020, with the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The situation has continued to evolve exponentially with implicated exposures increasing given sustained uncertainties across the global marketplace. Both the extensiveness of the pandemic itself, as well as the measures taken to mitigate the virus spread globally, are unprecedented and their effects continue to be pervasive. While vaccination efforts have begun in many geographic locations, the virus continues to spread. Accordingly, it remains the case that nearly a year past the initial identification of the threat, all of the direct and indirect consequences and implications of COVID-19 and measures to mitigate its spread are not yet known and may not emerge for some time.\nRisks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 that are known at this time include the following:\nBroad economic impact\nThe economic effect of the pandemic has been broad in nature and has significantly impacted business operations across all industries, including CNA. Depressed economic conditions have led to, and may continue to lead to, decreased insured exposures causing CNA to experience declines in premium volume, especially for lines of business that are sensitive to rates of economic growth and those that are impacted by audit premium adjustments. Significant decreases in premium volume directly and adversely impacts CNA\u2019s underwriting expense ratio. CNA recorded a decrease in its estimated audit premiums during the second quarter of 2020 impacting its net earned premium and if general economic conditions do not improve, CNA\u2019s net written premiums and net earned premiums may be depressed, which may have a material impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.\nWhile CNA\u2019s losses incurred during 2020 related to COVID-19 and measures to mitigate its spread represent CNA\u2019s best estimate of its ultimate insurance losses resulting from events occurring during 2020 due to the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis given the unprecedented nature of this event, a high level of uncertainty exists as to the potential impact on insurance losses from these events or other events that might occur in the future. The scope, duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects could continue to evolve, and could materially impact CNA\u2019s ultimate loss estimate, including in lines of business where losses have already been incurred, as well as the potential for impacts in other lines unknown at this time. Continued spread of the virus, as well as new or extended shelter in\nplace restrictions and full or partial business closures, could cause CNA to experience additional COVID-19 related catastrophe losses in future quarters, which could be material. For further discussion of risks associated with catastrophe losses, see the Risk Factor, \u201cCNA is vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.\u201d\nFinancial markets and investments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly impacted financial markets. As investors have embarked on a flight to quality, risk free rates have decreased. In addition, liquidity concerns and overall economic uncertainties drove increased volatility in credit spreads and equity markets. While government actions to date have provided some stability to financial markets, economic prospects in the short term continue to be depressed and CNA remains in a historically low interest rate environment. The continued spread of the virus and the extension of efforts to mitigate the spread in numerous geographic areas will continue to cause substantial uncertainty on the timing and strength of any economic recovery and could continue to impact CNA\u2019s investment portfolio results and valuations, and may result in additional volatility or losses in its investment portfolio, which could be material.\nThese significant financial market disruptions may have a material impact on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. For further discussion of risks associated with CNA\u2019s investments, see the Risk Factor, \u201cCNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.\u201d\nClaims and related litigation\nCNA has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the pandemic and mitigating actions taken by its customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread. These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers\u2019 compensation, commercial property-related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices, and professional liability lines) and trade credit. CNA has recorded significant losses in these areas during 2020 and may experience continued losses, which could be material. In addition, CNA\u2019s surety lines may experience increased losses, particularly in construction surety, where there is significant risk that contractors will be adversely and materially impacted by a prolonged decline in economic conditions.\nIncreased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, may have a material impact on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.\nCNA has also incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims. These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions under commercial property policies for business interruption coverage, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses. The significance of such litigation, both in substance and volume, and the resultant activities CNA has initiated, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.\nRegulatory impact\nThe regulatory environment is rapidly evolving in direct response to the pandemic and the related mitigating actions. Numerous regulatory authorities to which CNA\u2019s business is subject, have implemented or are contemplating broad and significant regulations restricting and governing insurance company operations during the pandemic crisis. Such actions include, but are not limited to, premium moratoriums, premium refunds and reductions, restrictions on policy cancellations and potential legislation-driven expansion of policy terms. To date, certain state authorities have ordered premium refunds and certain regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed requiring insurers to cover business interruption under policies that were not written to provide for such coverage under the current circumstances. In addition, certain states have directed expansion of workers\u2019 compensation coverage through presumption of compensability of claims for a broad category of workers. This highly fluid and challenging regulatory environment, and the new regulations CNA is now, and may be, subject to may have a material impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. For further\ndiscussion of risks associated with CNA\u2019s regulatory environment, see the Risk Factor, \u201cCNA is subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\u201d\nIf CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to CNA\u2019s earnings.\nCNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.\nThere is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. Certain risks and uncertainties associated with CNA\u2019s insurance reserves are outlined in the Insurance Reserves and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of MD&A in Item 7.\nCNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA\u2019s reserves. The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.\nIn light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If CNA\u2019s recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.\nCNA\u2019s actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.\nCNA\u2019s active life reserves for long term care policies are based on CNA\u2019s best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2020, due to a reserve unlocking at that date. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.\nEstimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and CNA\u2019s future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add reserves. The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial. See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of the Insurance Reserves section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.\nMorbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.\nA prolonged period during which investment returns remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA\u2019s reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA\u2019s obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to its reserves. This risk is more significant for CNA\u2019s long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which CNA discounts its reserves. In addition, CNA may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in CNA\u2019s reserving assumptions may require an increase to its reserves.\nCNA is vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.\nCatastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA\u2019s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.\nThe extent of CNA\u2019s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact CNA\u2019s ability to collect amounts owed to CNA by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses.\nReinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to \u201cunconventional\u201d terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. CNA\u2019s principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA through December 31, 2027. However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect CNA\u2019s business by increasing its exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering its business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure. For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.\nAs a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause CNA to exhaust its available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance. Accordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nCNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.\nCNA\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA\u2019s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.\nOn August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (\u201closs portfolio transfer\u201d or \u201cLPT\u201d). The cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of December 31, 2020 is $3.3 billion. If the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against earnings. These charges could be substantial. Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the loss portfolio transfer, CNA will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO. Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce CNA\u2019s earnings.\nCNA is exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from its insureds\u2019 sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.\nCNA faces potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims including, those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change. Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity. Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation could have a material adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCNA may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in CNA\u2019s underwriting commitments.\nA primary reason CNA purchases reinsurance is to manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA\u2019s ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA\u2019s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, CNA may have increased exposure to risk, which could be material. Alternatively, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk, which would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.\nCNA faces intense competition in its industry; it may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of its distribution network.\nAll aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services to remain competitive. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than CNA does, for both distributors and customers. This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with CNA to the extent that they continue to have direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insuretech firms, resulting in increased pressures on CNA\u2019s ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to CNA\u2019s customer base and risk appropriate to CNA.\nIn addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. During periods in which price competition is high, CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, CNA\u2019s premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.\nCNA markets its insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of CNA\u2019s competitors. Any change in CNA\u2019s relationships with its distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of CNA\u2019s competitors\u2019 products, could adversely affect CNA\u2019s ability to sell its products. As a result, CNA\u2019s business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nCNA may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.\nTechnological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and CNA\u2019s ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks. For example, more insurers are utilizing \u201cbig data\u201d analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing. If such utilization is more effective than how CNA uses similar data and information, CNA will be at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that CNA will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly this may have a material adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, agents and brokers, technology companies or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact CNA\u2019s competitive position. CNA\u2019s efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact CNA\u2019s business relationships with independent agents and brokers who currently market its products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.\nCNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.\nCNA\u2019s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond CNA\u2019s control can adversely affect the value of its investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities. CNA\u2019s investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of CNA\u2019s investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in the financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.\nCNA has significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing CNA\u2019s net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of its existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce CNA\u2019s net unrealized gains included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cAOCI\u201d). The value of CNA\u2019s fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments CNA holds or in the underlying collateral of the security.\nIn addition, CNA invests a portion of its assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed maturity investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit CNA\u2019s ability to withdraw funds from these investments. The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.\nFurther, CNA holds a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans. CNA is subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of the underlying properties, where lease payments directly service the loan. Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings.\nAs a result of these factors, CNA may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments, all of which could materially adversely affect CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCNA uses analytical models to assist its decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.\nCNA uses various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with its assets and liabilities. This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist CNA in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things. CNA incorporates numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis. Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.\nIn addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error. As a result, actual results may differ materially from CNA\u2019s modeled results. The profitability and financial condition of CNA substantially depends on the extent to which its actual experience is consistent with the assumptions CNA uses in its models and ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, CNA misprices its products or fails to appropriately estimate the risks it is exposed to, its business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nInability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on CNA\u2019s behalf could result in a material adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCNA may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. CNA\u2019s or its third party service providers\u2019 controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPortions of CNA\u2019s insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties. With respect to underwriting, CNA\u2019s contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of CNA\u2019s licenses. Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, CNA could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements. It is possible that in such circumstance CNA might not be fully indemnified for such third parties\u2019 contractual breaches.\nAdditionally, CNA relies on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of its long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions. Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against CNA and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.\nCNA has also licensed certain systems from third parties. CNA cannot be certain that it will have access to these systems or that its information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.\nThese risks could adversely impact CNA\u2019s reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.\nInsurance companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA\u2019s legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd\u2019s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction\u2019s regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves or the occurrence of a catastrophic event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates its capital position, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.\nThe IAIS has adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis Insurance Capital Standard (\u201cICS\u201d). The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS. The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase CNA\u2019s prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.\nCNA\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.\nCNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction. If CNA is restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, CNA may not be able to fund its corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay stockholder dividends from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.\nRating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA, adversely affecting its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing its cost of capital.\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA\u2019s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (\u201cA.M. Best\u201d), Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d). Ratings reflect the rating agency\u2019s opinions of an insurance company\u2019s or insurance holding company\u2019s financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.\nThe rating agencies may take action to lower CNA\u2019s ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on CNA\u2019s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among\nthe adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA\u2019s insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves. Further, if one or more of CNA\u2019s corporate debt ratings were downgraded, CNA may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and may incur higher borrowing costs.\nIn addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on CNA\u2019s ratings, independent of any change in CNA\u2019s circumstances. For further discussion of CNA\u2019s ratings, see the Subsidiaries portion of the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.\nCNA is subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on CNA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA\u2019s policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA conducts its business. Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on CNA. In addition, the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA\u2019s Hardy syndicate, operate.\nThese rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.\nRegulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict CNA from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA\u2019s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipelines\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including rules and regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including the types, rates and terms of services Boardwalk Pipelines may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities and recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. An adverse FERC action in any of these areas could affect Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to the FERC\u2019s regulations. The FERC can also deny Boardwalk Pipelines the right to abandon certain facilities from service.\nThe FERC also regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, the FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge. The basic elements that the FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates.\nThe FERC and/or Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 customers could challenge the maximum applicable rates that any of its regulated pipelines are allowed to charge in accordance with Section 5 of the NGA. Potential legislation that would amend Section 5 of the NGA to add refund provisions could increase the likelihood of such a challenge. If such a challenge is successful for any of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines, the revenues associated with transportation and storage services the pipeline provides pursuant to cost-of-service rates could materially decrease in the future, which would adversely affect the revenues on that pipeline going forward.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more prescriptive compliance activities, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or withdrawal of regulatory waivers could subject Boardwalk Pipelines to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA, which is part of the DOT. PHMSA regulates the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, and maintenance of existing interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. PHMSA regulation currently requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections, correction of certain identified anomalies and other measures to promote pipeline safety in HCAs, MCAs, Class 3 and Class 4 areas, as well as in areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. States have jurisdiction over certain of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 intrastate pipelines and have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations. State regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law that affect Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 intrastate operations. Compliance with these rules over time generally has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. The imposition of new or more stringent pipeline safety rules applicable to natural gas or NGL pipelines, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance from PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto could cause Boardwalk Pipelines to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipelines incurring increased capital and operating costs, experiencing operational delays and suffering potential adverse impacts to its operations or ability to reliably serve its customers. Requirements that are imposed under the 2011 Act or the more recent 2016 Act may also increase Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 capital and operating costs or impact the operation of its pipelines. In the Fiscal Year 2021 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Congress reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory actions. Any new pipeline safety legislation or implementing regulations could impose more stringent or costly compliance obligations on Boardwalk Pipelines and could require it to pursue additional capital projects or conduct integrity or maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipelines incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on its costs of providing transportation services.\nBoardwalk Pipelines has entered into certain firm transportation contracts with shippers on certain of its expansion projects that utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, based upon the authority Boardwalk Pipelines received from PHMSA to operate those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipeline\u2019s SMYS under issued permits with specific conditions. PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, it could affect Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets and it could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecasts, its anticipated cash flow from construction and development projects will not be immediate and its construction and development projects may not be completed on time or at all.\nBoardwalk Pipelines has been and is currently engaged in several construction projects involving its existing assets and the construction of new facilities for which it has expended or will expend significant capital. Boardwalk Pipelines expects to continue to engage in the construction of additional growth projects and modifications of its system. When Boardwalk Pipelines builds a new pipeline or expands or modifies an existing facility, the design, construction and\ndevelopment occurs over an extended period of time, and it will not receive any revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed into commercial service. On Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 interstate pipelines there are several years between when the project is announced and when customers begin using the new facilities. During this period, Boardwalk Pipelines spends capital and incurs costs without receiving any of the financial benefits associated with the projects. The construction of new assets involves regulatory (federal, state and local), landowner opposition, environmental, activist, legal, political, materials and labor costs, as well as operational and other risks that are difficult to predict and some are beyond Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 control. A project may not be completed on time or at all due to a variety of factors, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipelines is not aware of when it commits to the project. Any of these events could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change make Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 operations as well as the operations of its fossil fuel producer customers subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d).\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions, which makes Boardwalk Pipelines operations as well as the operations of its fossil fuel producer customers subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the U.S., no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. With the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has adopted several rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain natural gas system sources in the U.S., implement New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the U.S. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions, as the EPA under the Obama Administration published final regulations under the CAA establishing new performance standards for methane in 2016, but since that time the EPA under the Trump Administration has undertaken several measures, including publishing in September of 2020 final rule policy and technical amendments to the NSPS, for stationary sources of air emissions. The policy amendments, effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obama\u2019s Administration; whereas the technical amendments, effective November 16, 2020, included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules for gathering and boosting compressor stations and low-production wells, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and the EPA's September 2020 final rules, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order, that directed the EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September of 2021. A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow. The January 20, 2021, executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and VOC standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. Various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the non-binding Paris Agreement requests that nations limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Although the U.S. had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has issued executive orders recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the U.S.\u2019 nationally determined emissions reduction goal under the agreement. With the U.S. recommitting to the Paris Agreement, additional executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the U.S. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, suspending the issuance of new leases for oil and gas development on federal lands, pending completion of a review of leasing and permitting practices and expanding on the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior's January 20, 2020 order, effective immediately, that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. The executive order also called for the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risks across government agencies and economic sectors. Legal challenges to these suspensions are expected, with at least one industry group filing a lawsuit on January 27, 2021, in Wyoming federal district court and seeking to have the moratorium declared invalid. The new presidential administration could also pursue the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against fossil fuel producer companies in state or federal court, alleging that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel energy companies as investors in fossil fuel energy companies become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of climate change and may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. This could make it more difficult for Boardwalk Pipelines to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream energy business activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce fossil fuels or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for fossil fuels, which could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 transportation and storage services. Political, litigation and financial risks may result in its fossil fuel producer customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 services. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons, and for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 services. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations and those of its customers, suppliers and other business partners.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has materially negatively impacted worldwide economic and commercial activity and financial markets and has impacted global demand for oil and petrochemical products. COVID-19 has also resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. If significant portions of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19, its business could be materially adversely affected. Boardwalk Pipelines may also be unable to perform fully on its contracts, and its costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also further cause disruption in Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 customers\u2019 business; cause delay, or limit the ability of its customers to perform, including in making timely payments to it; and cause other\nunpredictable events. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted capital markets, which may impact Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 customers\u2019 financial position, and recoverability of its receivables from its customers may be at risk. The full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and continues to evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 business and operations will depend on the severity, location and duration of the effects and spread of COVID-19, the continued actions undertaken by national, regional and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume. It might also have the effect of increasing several of the other risk factors contained herein.\nChanges in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and NGLs, impact the supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 business.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 customers, especially producers and certain plant operators, are directly impacted by changes in commodity prices. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in both domestic and worldwide supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including for natural gas the realization of potential LNG exports and demand growth within the power generation market. The recent volatility in the pricing levels of natural gas, oil and NGLs has adversely affected the businesses of certain of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 producer customers and could result in defaults or the non-renewal of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. The current erosion in commodity prices could affect the operations of certain of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 industrial customers, including the temporary closure or reduction of plant operations, resulting in decreased deliveries to those customers. Future increases in the price of natural gas and NGLs could make alternative energy and feedstock sources more competitive and decrease demand for natural gas and NGLs. A reduced level of demand for natural gas and NGLs could diminish the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 systems and reduce the demand of its services.\nThe price differentials between natural gas supplies and market demand for natural gas have reduced the transportation rates that Boardwalk Pipelines can charge on certain portions of its pipeline systems.\nEach year a portion of Boardwalk Pipelines firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be replaced or renewed. Over the past several years, as a result of market conditions, Boardwalk Pipelines has renewed some expiring contracts at lower rates or for shorter terms than in the past. The transportation rates Boardwalk Pipelines is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available supply, geographical location of natural gas production, the competition between producing basins, competition with other pipelines for supply and markets, the demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas (basis differentials). Market conditions have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials on certain portions of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipeline system, which has reduced transportation rates that can be charged in the affected areas and adversely affected the contract terms Boardwalk Pipelines can secure from its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts being renewed or replaced. Boardwalk Pipelines expects these market conditions to continue.\nBoardwalk Pipelines is exposed to credit risk relating to default or bankruptcy by its customers.\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the default by a customer of its contractual obligations or the customer filing bankruptcy. Boardwalk Pipelines has credit risk with both its existing customers and those supporting its growth projects. Credit risk exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 growth projects, both because expansion customers make long term firm capacity commitments to Boardwalk Pipelines for such projects and certain of those expansion customers agree to provide credit support as construction for such projects progresses. If a customer fails to post the required credit support or defaults during the growth project process, overall returns on the project may be reduced to the extent an adjustment to the scope of the project occurs or Boardwalk Pipelines is unable to replace the defaulting customer with a customer willing to pay similar rates. In 2020 and 2019, two expansion customers declared bankruptcy for which Boardwalk Pipelines was able to use the credit support obtained during the growth project process to cover a portion of the customer\u2019s remaining long term commitment.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 credit exposure also includes receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipelines to them under certain NNS and parking and lending (\u201cPAL\u201d) services.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that restrict its business and financing activities.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue business activities. Its credit agreement limits its ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of its business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, or grant liens or make negative pledges. This agreement also requires it to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of not more than 5.0 to 1.0, or up to 5.5 to 1.0 for the three quarters following a qualified acquisition or series of acquisitions, where the purchase price exceeds $100.0 million over a rolling 12-month period, which limits the amount of additional indebtedness Boardwalk Pipelines can incur to grow its business, and could require it to reduce indebtedness if its earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) decreases to a level that would cause it to breach this covenant. Future financing agreements Boardwalk Pipelines may enter into could contain similar or more restrictive covenants or may not be as favorable as those under its existing indebtedness.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, including economic, financial and market conditions. If market, economic conditions or its financial performance deteriorate, its ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Boardwalk Pipelines is not able to incur additional indebtedness, it may be required to seek other sources of funding that may be on less favorable terms. If it defaults under its credit agreement or another financing agreement, significant additional restrictions may become applicable. In addition, a default could result in a significant portion of its indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable, and its lenders could terminate their commitment to make further loans to it. If such event occurs, Boardwalk Pipelines would not have, and may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Boardwalk Pipelines had $3.5 billion in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, including amounts borrowed under its revolving credit facility. This level of debt requires significant interest payments. Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general business activities;\n\u2022\nimpact the ratings received from credit rating agencies;\n\u2022\nincrease Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.\nBoardwalk Pipelines is permitted, under its revolving credit facility and the indentures governing its notes, to incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations under its revolving credit facility and, in the case of unsecured debt, under the indentures governing the notes. If Boardwalk Pipelines incurs additional debt, its increased leverage could also result in the consequences described above.\nLimited access to the debt markets and increases in interest rates could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 business.\nBoardwalk Pipelines anticipates funding its capital spending requirements through its available financing options, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Changes in the debt markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and an increase in interest rates, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. This may affect its ability to raise needed funding and reduce the amount of cash available to fund its operations or growth projects. If the debt markets were not available, it is not certain if other adequate financing options would be available to Boardwalk Pipelines on terms and conditions that it would find acceptable.\nAny disruption in the debt markets could require Boardwalk Pipelines to take additional measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until it can arrange alternative credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs. Such measures could include reducing or delaying business activities, reducing its operations to lower expenses and reducing other discretionary uses of cash. Boardwalk Pipelines may be unable to execute its growth strategy or take advantage of certain business opportunities.\nBoardwalk Pipelines does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to its operations.\nSubstantial portions of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines, storage and other facilities are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents, and Boardwalk Pipelines is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use rights if it does not have valid land use rights or if such land use rights lapse or terminate. Some of the rights to construct and operate Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines storage or other facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies that it obtains are for specific periods of time. Boardwalk Pipelines cannot guarantee that it will always be able to renew, when necessary, existing land use rights or obtain new land use rights without experiencing significant costs or experiencing landowner opposition. Any loss of these land use rights with respect to the operation of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines, storage and other facilities, through its inability to renew right-of-way or easement contracts or permits, licenses, consents or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nRising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could damage Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines and the facilities that serve its customers, particularly along coastal waters and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipeline operations along coastal waters and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico could be impacted by rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion. Subsidence issues are also a concern for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 pipelines at major river crossings. Rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could cause serious damage to its pipelines, which could affect its ability to provide transportation services or result in leakage, migration, releases or spills from its operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water, groundwater or offshore waters, which could result in liability, remedial obligations and/or otherwise have a negative impact on continued operations. Such rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion processes could impact Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 customers who operate along coastal waters or offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and they may be unable to utilize Boardwalk Pipelines services. Rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could also expose Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 operations to increased risks associated with severe weather conditions and other adverse events and conditions, such as hurricanes and flooding. As a result, Boardwalk Pipelines may incur significant costs to repair and preserve its pipeline infrastructure. In recent years, local governments and landowners have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against energy companies, alleging that their operations contributed to increased coastal rising seas and erosion and seeking substantial damages.\nBoardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.\nBoardwalk Pipelines relies primarily on the revenues generated from its natural gas transportation and storage services. Negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to grow, diversify and increase cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its existing business lines and to close and execute on accretive acquisitions. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. Any such transactions involve potential risks that may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;\n\u2022\na decrease in Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 liquidity as a result of using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;\n\u2022\na significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if it incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project or if Boardwalk Pipelines makes inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of debt;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.\nAdditionally, acquisitions also contain the following risks:\n\u2022\nan inability to integrate successfully the businesses Boardwalk Pipelines acquires;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities for which it is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses of an acquired business.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 ability to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all are subject to market conditions.\nBoardwalk Pipelines owns and operates substantial natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. When market conditions cause a narrowing of time period price spreads and a decline in the price volatility of natural gas, these factors adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its storage and PAL services.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\u2019 operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which it may not be adequately insured.\nThere are a variety of operating risks inherent in transporting and storing natural gas, ethylene and NGLs, such as leaks and other forms of releases, explosions, fires, cyber-attacks and mechanical problems, which could have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the nature and location of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 business may make it susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and other severe weather. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of its operations and substantial financial losses. The location of pipelines in HCAs, which includes populated areas, residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks.\nBoardwalk Pipelines currently possesses property, business interruption, cyber threat and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Boardwalk Pipelines does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or all potential losses.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Loews Hotels & Co\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have had, and are expected to continue to have, material adverse impacts on Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, governments across the globe implemented measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, such as through city, regional or national lockdowns or stay-at-home orders, narrowly defined and widespread business closures, restrictions on travel, limitations on large group gatherings and quarantines, among others. Beyond the existence of governmental restrictions, the perception of health risks associated with COVID-19 has limited, and continues to further limit, business and leisure travel. Furthermore, theme parks in Orlando, Florida, which temporarily closed, now operate at reduced capacity levels. In addition, certain coastal beaches repeatedly have been ordered closed and professional sports leagues have suspended or modified their seasons with no or limited spectators permitted in attendance. The spread of the coronavirus and the containment efforts have had, and continue to have, macro-economic implications, including increased unemployment levels, declines in economic growth rates and possibly a global recession, the effects of which could be felt well beyond the time the spread of the virus is mitigated or contained. These developments have caused unprecedented disruptions to the global economy and normal business operations across sectors, including the hospitality industry that depends on active levels of business and leisure travel, very little of which is occurring in the current environment.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, beginning in March of 2020, Loews Hotels & Co temporarily suspended operations at the majority of its owned and/or operated hotels. Since then, most hotels have resumed operations, but occupancy rates remain considerably lower than those from the prior year, or even occupancy rates prior to March of 2020. As such, revenues have been substantially lower and may be insufficient to offset certain fixed costs, such as insurance and property taxes. As of February 5, 2021, five hotels have suspended operations. These five hotels continue to be evaluated to determine when it will be prudent to resume operations. The potential for the suspension or resuspension of operations at operating hotels varies by hotel property and will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s control. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, Loews Hotels & Co has had to implement a number of new measures for the health and safety of its guests and employees. These new measures, which may need to remain in place for the foreseeable future, have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs.\nGiven that Loews Hotels & Co owns and leases, relative to some of its competitors, a higher proportion of its hotel properties, compared to the number of properties that it manages for third-party owners, it may as a result of COVID-19 and mitigation measures face increased risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, cash trap periods, the inability to draw further loan disbursements and reduced availability of replacement financing at reasonable terms or at all; difficulty reducing costs; declines in real estate values and potential additional impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s assets; and a limited ability to respond to market conditions. In addition, uncertain or fluctuating real estate valuations and the inability for third-party purchasers to obtain capital may prevent Loews Hotels & Co from selling properties on acceptable terms.\nThe full extent and duration of the impacts caused by the COVID-19 outbreak on Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows remains largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued severity, duration (including the extent of any resurgences in the future), transmission rate and geographic spread of COVID-19 in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, the extent and effectiveness of the containment measures taken, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted, the timing and ability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat COVID-19, and the response of the overall economy, financial markets and the population, particularly in areas in which Loews Hotels & Co operates, once the current containment measures are reduced or lifted. Accordingly, COVID-19 presents continuing material uncertainty and risk with respect to Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEven following containment of COVID-19, continuing uncertainty exists around when and if Loews Hotels & Co will be able to resume normal, pre-COVID-19 level operations for business or leisure travel. Once the COVID-19 outbreak is mitigated or contained, whenever that may be, historical travel patterns, both domestic and international, may continue to be disrupted either on a temporary basis or with longer term effects. For example, certain travel is\ndependent on commercial airlines restoring capacity, and their inability to restore full capacity could impact demand for Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s services. Additionally, businesses now forced to rely on remote working and videoconferences may reduce the level of business travel both to save costs and to reduce the risk of exposure for their employees, and they may also seek alternatives to large public gatherings such as conferences and conventions. Leisure travelers may also be less inclined to travel or gather in large groups out of ongoing safety concerns, regardless of the lifting of mandated or recommended restrictions. In addition, with the expected adverse impact on jobs and the economy more broadly, at least in the short term, leisure travel will likely be further impacted due to economic reasons. Further, the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, may not recover as quickly as other industries. Any of these trends could have continuing material adverse effects on Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nAs part of cost containment efforts, Loews Hotels & Co put a substantial number of its employees on unpaid leaves of absence or have severed them from the organization. When conditions warrant the resumption of operations that necessitate increased staffing levels, it may not be able to find or attract sufficient talent to fill the roles that have been furloughed or eliminated. Additionally, many of its service providers and suppliers have also put their employees on leaves of absence or have severed employees. Should they be unable to find or attract sufficient talent to fill the roles that they have furloughed or eliminated, Loews Hotels & Co may not have the requisite services or supplies available to resume operations at the time or in the manner of its choosing.\nLoews Hotels & Co continues to evaluate spending and manage operating expenses, including eliminating non-essential spending, reducing costs related to its management company, marketing, sales, and technology and deferring planned renovations, all of which could impair its ability to compete effectively and harm its business. Loews Hotels & Co has received and may receive additional demands or requests from labor unions that represent its employees, whether in the course of its periodic renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits, operational protocols or other terms that could increase costs, and could experience labor disputes or disruptions as it continues to implement mitigation or re-opening plans. Some actions Loews Hotels & Co has taken, or may take in the future, to reduce costs for it or its third-party owners may negatively impact guest loyalty, owner preference, and its ability to attract and retain employees, and its reputation and market share may suffer as a result. Further, once the effects of the pandemic subside, the recovery period could be extensive and certain operational changes, particularly with respect to enhanced health and safety measures, may continue to be necessary and could increase ongoing costs.\nHotels are buildings designed to remain open every hour of every day. As Loews Hotels & Co has not previously suspended the operations of its hotels (other than in connection with planned renovations) for an extended period of time, there may be mechanical systems that require material repair and maintenance to restart for hotels that remain under a suspension of operations, or for facilities and outlets within operational hotels that continue to not be utilized.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s construction projects could be delayed as a result of COVID-19 and related containment efforts, including delays applicable to or affecting contractors, suppliers and inspectors required to review projects.\nAs a manager of hotels owned by joint ventures that Loews Hotels & Co invests in and by third parties, Loews Hotels & Co earns fees based on the revenues that those managed hotels generate. As a result of reduced revenues described above due to COVID-19 and mitigating measures, Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s fee-based revenues are also materially reduced. Certain of these properties also have contracts that require payments by Loews Hotels & Co to preserve its management of the hotel if the hotel\u2019s operating results do not achieve certain performance levels. These payments may be uneconomical for Loews Hotels & Co and lead to Loews Hotels & Co no longer managing one or more of those properties.\nIn properties in which Loews Hotels & Co has an ownership interest, Loews Hotels & Co leases space to third-party tenants and earns both fixed and variable amounts of rent, depending on each underlying lease arrangement. Some of these tenants informed Loews Hotels & Co that their operations are similarly impacted by COVID-19 business restrictions causing rent abatement periods in certain circumstances. In addition, variable rent, which is generally tied to the tenant\u2019s sales, has been, and will continue to be, materially adversely affected by the effects of the pandemic.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected by various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, including competition, excess supply and dependence on business travel and tourism.\nLoews Hotels & Co owns and operates hotels that have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets. A typical office property, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Hotels, on the other hand, generate revenue from guests that typically stay at the hotel for only a few nights, which causes the room rate and occupancy levels at each hotel to change every day, and results in earnings that can be highly volatile.\nIn addition, Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties are subject to various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, many of which are beyond Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy and financial markets, as well as more localized changes in the economy of each hotel\u2019s geographic location;\n\u2022\nwar, political conditions or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as the recent coronavirus;\n\u2022\nfederal, state or local government-mandated travel restrictions and/or shut-down orders of hotels or other drivers that reduce demand for hotel businesses;\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters or other catastrophes;\n\u2022\nmaterial reductions or prolonged interruptions of public utilities and services;\n\u2022\ndecreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business due to self-imposed and/or government-mandated travel restrictions, adverse economic conditions or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndecreased need for business-related travel due to innovations in business-related technology;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other hotels and alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb, in the markets in which Loews Hotels & Co operates;\n\u2022\nrequirements for periodic capital reinvestment to maintain and upgrade hotels;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating costs, including labor (such as from minimum wage increases), workers\u2019 compensation, benefits, insurance, food and beverage, commodity costs, energy and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events, due to inflation, new or different federal, state or local governmental regulations, including tariffs, constrained supply, and other factors that may not be offset by increased revenues;\n\u2022\nthe costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\norganized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties generally as a result of certain labor tactics;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers, including with respect to the underlying attractions supporting Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s immersive destination properties, such as the Universal theme park for its Orlando, Florida properties, and stadiums, arenas and convention centers for properties in other markets;\n\u2022\ngeographic concentration of operations and customers;\n\u2022\nshortages of desirable locations for development; and\n\u2022\nrelationships with third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners, including the risk that third-party property owners, developers and/or partners may encounter financial difficulties, may not fulfill material obligations and/or may terminate lease, management, joint venture or other agreements.\nIn addition to materially affecting the business of Loews Hotels & Co generally, these factors, and the reputational repercussions of these factors, could materially adversely affect, and from time to time have materially adversely affected, individual hotels and hotels in particular regions.\nLoews Hotels & Co is exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase its costs, reduce its profits, limit its ability to respond to market conditions or restrict its growth strategy.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties that it manages for third-party owners, is larger than that of some of its competitors. Real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:\n\u2022\nreal estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental and eminent domain laws;\n\u2022\nthe ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels and the availability of replacement financing;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the possibility that cost increases will outpace revenue increases and that, in the event of an economic slowdown, a high proportion of fixed costs will make it difficult to reduce costs to the extent required to offset declining revenues;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with real estate leases, including the possibility of rent increases and the inability to renew or extend upon favorable terms;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with real estate condominiums, including the possibility of special assessments by condominiums that Loews Hotels & Co does not control;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in real estate values and potential impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s assets; and\n\u2022\nthe relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.\nThe hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility.\nThe hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the consumer base served. Historically, Loews Hotels & Co generally has experienced revenues and earnings that are lower in the third quarter of each year than in each of the other quarters. In addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. The seasonality and cyclicality of its industry may contribute to fluctuation in Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLoews Hotels & Co operates in a highly competitive industry, both for customers and for acquisitions and developments of new properties.\nThe hospitality industry is highly competitive. Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties compete with other hotels and alternative accommodations based on a number of factors, including room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Some of its competitors also have greater financial and marketing resources than Loews Hotels & Co. In addition, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.\nLoews Hotels & Co also competes for hotel acquisitions and development projects with entities that have similar investment objectives as it does. This competition could limit the number of suitable investment opportunities. It may also increase the bargaining power of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s counterparties, making it more difficult for Loews Hotels & Co to acquire or develop new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in its business plan.\nAny deterioration in the quality or reputation of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s brands could have a material adverse effect on its reputation and business.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s brands and reputation are among its most important assets. Its ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of its brands and their associated reputation. If its brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, or its brands or reputation are otherwise harmed, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to attract guests to its properties, and may further be unable to attract or retain joint venture partners or hotel owners. Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s reputation may also suffer as a result of negative publicity regarding its hotels, including as a result of social media reports, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity. The continued expansion of media and social media formats has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity and has made it more difficult to control and effectively manage negative publicity.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s efforts to develop new properties and renovate existing properties could be delayed or become more expensive.\nLoews Hotels & Co from time to time needs to renovate its properties and is currently expanding its portfolio through the ground-up construction of a new property in Coral Gables, Florida. Further it may in the future similarly develop additional new properties. Often these projects are undertaken with joint venture partners who may also serve as developer. These renovation and construction efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nconstruction delays, changes to plans and specifications and cost overruns (including labor and materials or unforeseeable site conditions) that may increase project costs; cause new development projects to not be completed by lender imposed required completion dates or subject Loews Hotels & Co to cancellation penalties for reservations accepted;\n\u2022\nobtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;\n\u2022\nprojects financed with construction debt are subject to interest rate risk as uncertain timing and amount of draws make effective hedging difficult to obtain;\n\u2022\nweather delays and force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes or floods; and\n\u2022\ndesign defects that could increase costs.\nAdditionally, developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before the properties begin to operate and generate revenue. If the cost of funding new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially anticipated, Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s operating results could be reduced. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, intervening adverse economic conditions in general and as they apply to Loews Hotels & Co and its development partners may alter or impede the development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs or potential impairment charges. In addition, using multiple sources of capital to develop new properties reduces or eliminates the ability of Loews Hotels & Co to cease commenced projects if the overall economic environment conditions change. Moreover, during the early stages of operations, charges related to interest expense and depreciation may substantially detract from, or even outweigh, the profitability of certain new property investments.\nCo-investing in hotel properties decreases Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s ability to manage risk.\nLoews Hotels & Co has from time to time invested, and expects to continue to invest, in hotel properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business interests or goals. Further, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to take action without the approval of its co-investors, or its co-investors could take actions binding on the property without the consent of Loews Hotels & Co. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, Loews Hotels & Co could become liable for its share of liabilities.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties are geographically concentrated, which exposes its business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.\nLoews Hotels & Co has a concentration of hotels in Florida. Specifically, as of December 31, 2020, eight hotels, representing 54% of rooms in its system, were located at Universal Orlando in Orlando, Florida and nine hotels, representing approximately 59% of rooms in its system, were located in Florida. The concentration of hotels in one region or a limited number of markets may expose Loews Hotels & Co to risks of adverse economic and other developments that are greater than if its portfolio were more geographically diverse. These developments include regional economic downturns, a decline in the popularity of or access to area tourist attractions, such as theme parks, significant increases in the number of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s competitors\u2019 hotels in these markets and potentially higher local property, sales and income taxes, property insurance costs or other expenses in the geographic markets in which it is concentrated. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties in Florida are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as hurricanes, strong winds and flooding, which have in the past caused damage to its hotels in Florida, and which may in the future be intensified as a result of climate change, as well as outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases. Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business may be significantly affected by other risks common to the Florida tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt or reduce air travel to and from Florida for any reason can adversely affect its business.\nThe growth and use of alternative reservation channels adversely affects Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business.\nA significant percentage of hotel rooms for guests at Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties is booked through internet travel and other intermediaries. In most cases, Loews Hotels & Co has agreements with such intermediaries and pays them commissions and/or fees for sales of its rooms through their systems. If such bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or fees, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from Loews Hotels & Co. There can be no assurance that Loews Hotels & Co will be able to negotiate such agreements in the future with terms as favorable as those that exist today. Moreover, these intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites and other outlets. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries\u2019 offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s brands.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s insurance coverage may not cover all possible losses, and it may not be able to renew its insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.\nAlthough Loews Hotels & Co maintains various property, casualty and other insurance policies, proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Additionally, insurance policies that it maintains may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Loews Hotels & Co maintains may contain large deductibles or may not cover all risks to which its properties are potentially subject.\nLabor shortages could restrict Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s ability to operate its properties or grow its business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce its results of operations.\nLoews Hotels & Co\u2019s properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of employees. If it is unable to attract, retain, train and engage skilled employees, its ability to manage and staff its properties adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder its ability to grow and expand its business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at its properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase its labor costs.\nA portion of Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s business and results of operations. A prolonged dispute with covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise could have an adverse impact on Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s operations. Adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm its reputation and reduce customer demand for its services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could have an adverse impact on its results of operations. To the extent that Loews Hotels & Co\u2019s non-union employees join unions, Loews Hotels & Co would have greater exposure to risks associated with such labor problems. Furthermore, Loews Hotels & Co may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status and a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such events or additional costs may have materially adverse effects.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Altium Packaging\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on Altium Packaging.\nAltium Packaging manufactures packaging that is used with products in critical sectors, such as the pharmaceutical, household and industrial cleaning and food and beverage markets, and is thus an essential business as contemplated by state and local orders. It therefore has operated, and continues to operate, nearly all of its manufacturing facilities at full capacity to support those sectors. However, certain of Altium Packaging\u2019s end markets, such as its commercial food services, institutional food and automotive customers, have been negatively impacted and its sales to those customers have been adversely affected. In addition, if widespread infections were to affect any of its facilities or workers, including those supporting critical sectors, it may be required to temporarily shut down or otherwise modify the working conditions at such facilities to address the infections. Any such changes could cause Altium Packaging to be unable to meet demand from its customers if it cannot provide support from other facilities in its network.\nAltium Packaging\u2019s substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.\nAltium Packaging has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Its inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Altium Packaging\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit its ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.\nIn addition, the credit agreements governing its current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which impose operating and financial restrictions on it. As a result of these covenants, Altium Packaging could be limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on Altium Packaging.\nAltium Packaging is exposed to changes in consumer preferences.\nSales of Altium Packaging\u2019s plastic containers depend heavily on the volume of sales made by its customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that it serves or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns or perceptions regarding plastics, may result in a decline in the demand for Altium Packaging\u2019s plastic container products.\nFluctuations in raw material prices and raw material availability may materially affect Altium Packaging\u2019s results of operations.\nTo produce its products, Altium Packaging uses large quantities of plastic resins and recycled plastic materials. It faces the risk that its access to these raw materials may be interrupted or that it may not be able to purchase these raw materials at prices that are acceptable to it. In general, Altium Packaging does not have long-term supply contracts with its suppliers, and its purchases of raw materials are subject to market price volatility. Although Altium Packaging generally is able to pass changes in the prices of raw materials through to its customers over a period of time, it may not always be able to do so or there may be a lag between when its costs increase and when it passes those costs through to its customers. It may not be able to pass through all future raw material price increases in a timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures. In addition, a sustained increase in resin and recycled plastic prices, relative to alternative packaging materials, would make plastic containers less economical for its customers and could result in reductions in the use of plastic containers. Any limitation on its ability to procure its primary raw materials or to pass through price increases in such materials on a timely basis could materially negatively affect Altium Packaging.\nAltium Packaging\u2019s customers may increase their self-manufacturing.\nIncreased self-manufacturing by Altium Packaging\u2019s customers may have a material adverse impact on its sales volume and financial results. Altium Packaging believes that its customers may engage in self-manufacturing over time at locations where transportation costs are high, and where low complexity and available space to install blow molding equipment exist.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally\nIn addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face additional risks and uncertainties described below.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread impacts on the way we and our subsidiaries operate.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and mitigating measures has had, and continues to have, macroeconomic implications, including increased unemployment levels, declines in economic growth rates and possibly a global recession, the effects of which could be felt well beyond the time during which the spread of the virus is mitigated or contained. These developments have caused unprecedented disruptions to the global economy and normal business operations across sectors and countries, including the sectors and countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate. Because of the size and breadth of the pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time.\nAs a result of workplace restrictions, both voluntary and those imposed by governmental authorities, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, large portions of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 employees are working from home, which, among other things, may disrupt their productivity. Similar workplace restrictions are in place at many of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 critical vendors, which may result in interruptions in service delivery or failure by vendors to properly perform required services. In addition, having shifted to remote working arrangements and being more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities, we and our subsidiaries also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents. We and our subsidiaries also self-insure our health benefits and therefore may experience increased medical claims as a result of the pandemic.\nActs of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.\nTerrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in the United States or abroad, the continuation or escalation of existing armed hostilities or the outbreak of additional hostilities, including military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on us and the assets and businesses of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from an act of terrorism. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism could also result in increased political, economic and financial market instability, a decline in energy consumption and volatility in the price of oil and gas, which could affect the market for Boardwalk Pipelines\u2019 transportation and storage services. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels & Co. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.\nOur subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.\nOur subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws, including those relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal, removal or clean up of hazardous wastes and other activities relating to the protection of the environment. Many of such laws have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Boardwalk Pipelines is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination resulting from a spill or other release and requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements. In addition, Altium Packaging may be adversely affected by laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Further, existing environmental laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may be amended and new laws may be adopted in the future.\nFailures or interruptions in or breaches to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 computer systems could materially and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries\u2019 operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are dependent upon information technologies, computer systems and networks, including those maintained by us and our subsidiaries and those maintained and provided to us and our subsidiaries by third parties (for example, \u201csoftware-as-a-service\u201d and cloud solutions), to conduct operations and are reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our and their businesses. We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon operational and\nfinancial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our and their businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 computer systems, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer, telecommunications and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes, including storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, utility outages, theft, design defects, human error or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called \u201ccyber attacks\u201d on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. In particular, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets may be specific targets of cyber attacks, which can have catastrophic consequences and hotel chains, among other consumer-facing businesses, have been subject to various cyber attacks targeting payment card and other sensitive consumer information. Breaches of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 computer security infrastructure can result from actions by our employees, vendors, third party administrators or by unknown third parties, and may disrupt our or their operations, cause significant damage to our or their assets and surrounding areas, cause loss of life or serious bodily injury and impact our or their data framework or cause a failure to protect personal information of customers or employees.\nThe foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could impact our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to timely perform critical business functions, resulting in disruption or deterioration in our and our subsidiaries\u2019 operations and business and expose us and our subsidiaries to monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security related investments. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\nLoss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries rely on products, equipment and services provided by many third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers in the United States and abroad, which exposes us and them to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services (including, in the case of CNA, claims administrators performing significant claims administration and adjudication functions). Certain products, equipment and services may be available from a limited number of sources. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products, equipment or services at the requisite level for any reason, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business, operations and reputation.\nWe could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of pipeline and storage assets at Boardwalk Pipelines and hotel investments owned by Loews Hotels & Co.\nWe also test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Asset impairment evaluations by us and our subsidiaries with respect to both long-lived assets and goodwill are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.\nWe are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.\nWe rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to,\namong other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.\nWe and our subsidiaries face competition for senior executives and qualified specialized talent.\nWe and our subsidiaries depend on the services of our key personnel, who possess skills critical to the operation of our and their businesses. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 executive management teams are highly experienced and possess extensive skills in their relevant industries. The ability to retain senior executives and to attract and retain highly skilled professionals and personnel with specialized industry and technical experience is important to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 success and future growth. Competition for this talent can be intense, and we and our subsidiaries may not be successful in our efforts. The unexpected loss of the services of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us and our subsidiaries and could hinder our and their ability to effectively compete in the various industries in which we and they operate.\nFrom time to time we and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation, for which we and they may be unable to accurately assess the level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our or their financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings and disputes. These matters may include, among others, contract disputes, claims disputes, reinsurance disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, intellectual property disputes, disputes related to employment and tax matters and other litigation incidental to our or their businesses. It is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation matters and the outcome of any pending or future litigation could have a significant impact on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 26710, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "L"}
