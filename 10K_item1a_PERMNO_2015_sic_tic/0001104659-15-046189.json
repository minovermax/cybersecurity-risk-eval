Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and in our other public filings. If any of such risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially, potentially causing the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. The following section lists some, but not all, of these risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nIF OUR NEW PRODUCTS ARE NOT ACCEPTED IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR WE FAIL TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS TO KEEP PACE WITH RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, OUR REVENUE MAY DECLINE.\nWe have devoted significant resources to the research and development of products and technologies. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on continued research and development efforts with respect to both our existing and new products, as well as the integration of newer technologies. We have made extensive efforts to leverage our core intellectual property to create new product lines, including our Postano social media visualization platform. There can be no assurance that these new products will be successful or generate significant revenue.\nThe MDMS Business represented a significant portion of our historical revenues and there can be no assurances that we will be able to replace those revenues with revenues from our retained or newly developed products quickly, or at all. A large portion of the MDMS Business consisted of the sale of annual software maintenance and support services, which provided a historically relatively stable revenue stream. The lower sales volume of annual software maintenance and support services from our retained Omnis products, combined with our limited history and small installed base of our Postano products, may result in larger fluctuations in revenue.\nThe development of new or enhanced software products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as accurate anticipation of customer and technical trends. The development and introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer ordering patterns. Failure to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products, in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or lack of customer acceptance of our products, will materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate any acquired products and technologies, identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products.\nOUR FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive, diverse and subject to rapid change. Our products and services compete on the basis of the following key characteristics: performance; inter-operability; scalability; functionality; reliability; pricing; post-sale customer support; quality; compliance with industry standards; and overall total cost of ownership. The application development tools software market is rapidly changing and intensely competitive. Our Omnis products currently encounter competition from several direct competitors, including Microsoft, and competing development environments, including JAVA. Direct competitors of our Postano social media visualization platform include Facebook and Twitter, as well as numerous smaller companies in the emerging social media marketplace. Additionally, as we expand our business and integrate acquired products and technologies, we expect to compete with a different group of companies, including smaller, highly focused companies offering single products.\nThe strong competition we face in the sales of our products and services, and general economic and business conditions, can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow.\nMost of our competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, evolving markets and changes in customer requirements, and may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Our products and services could fall behind marketplace demands at any time. If we fail to address these competitive challenges, our business and operating results could suffer materially.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS OR MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR SALES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS, AND WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT OUR SALES EFFORTS MAY HAVE ON OUR FUTURE REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results and continue to grow our business, it is important that we continually attract new customers and that we maintain or grow our sales to existing customers. Sales to our existing customers may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, their satisfaction with our products and our customer support, the level of usage of our products, the pricing of our, or competing, software products and related services, and reductions in spending levels or changes in our customers\u2019 anticipated usage of our products. Within the Postano business, we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, so we may not accurately predict future renewal trends. We cannot assure you that our customers will renew their subscriptions, and if our customers do not renew their agreements or renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our revenues may be adversely impacted.\nTo the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we could incur increased losses because costs associated with generating customer agreements and performing services are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. This risk is particularly applicable for those customers who choose to deploy our products in the public cloud. If new customers sign agreements with short initial subscription periods and do not renew their subscriptions, our operating results could be negatively impacted due to the upfront expenses associated with our sales and implementation efforts. Alternatively, to the extent we are unsuccessful in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products intended to attract new customers would not be offset by future incremental revenues and cash flow.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customers make additional significant purchases of our functionality and offerings. If our customers do not purchase additional functionality or offerings, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts. There can be no assurance that these efforts would result in increased sales to existing customers, or upsells, and additional revenues. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business will suffer.\nBECAUSE WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR OUR POSTANO PRODUCTS RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, NEAR TERM CHANGES IN SALES MAY NOT BE REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customer subscriptions for our Postano products ratably over the term of their agreements, which generally range from 1 to12 months. As a result, most of the revenues from our Postano products that we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter is not likely to be reflected immediately in our revenue results for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenues in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our Postano products, and potential changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In most instances, our customers pre-pay the entire term of their multi period subscriptions up front. As a result, billings can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global economic conditions. If economic conditions become uncertain in key markets, including without limitation the United States and Western Europe where we derive a majority of our revenue, we may experience adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recession, rising inflation, diminished credit availability, declining valuation of investments or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower spending by our customers and could adversely affect our revenue. For example, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, potentially causing them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. Further, since we generally license our Omnis software on a per-CPU, per-server, per-port or per-user basis, any decrease in CPUs, servers, ports or users by our customers would result in a decrease in our revenue. Similarly, declines in subscription renewals or purchases of add-on products or services by our Postano customers would result in a decrease in our revenues. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial results.\nWE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.\nWe recorded net loss of approximately $28.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, including an $18.2 million goodwill impairment charge. Although we recorded net income of approximately $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, this income included $8.6 million of income related to our MDMS Business, which was sold on November 15, 2013. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $139.1 million as of March 31, 2015. We expect that we will continue to incur losses in the immediate future for a number of reasons, including uncertainty as to: (i) the level of our future revenues; (ii) our efforts to monetize newer technologies and services we have developed, including Postano, and (iii) our efforts to integrate acquired products and technologies. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for our new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. We will need to generate increases in our revenues to achieve and maintain profitability, particularly given the current small size of our business relative to costs associated with being a public company. If our revenue fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate or our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our losses would increase which could harm our business and operating results.\nIF OUR COMMON STOCK IS DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STOCK PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR STOCK AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING COULD BE IMPAIRED, AND, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER CLAIMS.\nOn October 7, 2014, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ notifying us that we were not in compliance with the requirement of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cListing Rule\u201d) for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market as a result of the closing bid price for our common stock being below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with the Listing Rule, we were given 180 calendar days, or until April 6, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum\nbid price requirement. We did not regain compliance by April 6, 2015 and as a result asked for an extension of an additional 180 days to regain compliance which was granted by NASDAQ, extending the deadline to regain compliance to October 5, 2015. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock must maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. No assurance can be given that we will regain compliance during the extension period or that we will be able to maintain continued compliance with the other listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market. As of the filing date of this annual report on Form 10-K, our stock continued to trade below the minimum $1.00 closing bid price. If we do not regain compliance with the Listing Rule during the extension period, the NASDAQ staff will provide notice that our common stock is subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market. In that event, we may appeal such determination to a hearings panel.\nAny delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades, and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to possible delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market, the sustained decrease in the trading price of our common stock may increase our exposure to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nOUR PRODUCTS SALES CYCLE VARIES MAKING FORECASTING OF REVENUE CHALLENGING.\nThe sales cycle for our Postano social media visualization platform varies significantly and can range from one to six months or longer. Market adoption of newer social media platforms such as Postano is still at a relatively early stage as brands are discovering and learning how to leverage fan generated social content for marketing and customer engagement. Since we typically sell time-based subscriptions to the Postano platform, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which does not begin until customers activate their platform. In addition, the social media market is competitive, which can result in customers taking a significant period of time to evaluate multiple solutions before making purchasing decisions. As a result, a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and recognition of revenue, making it difficult to forecast revenue levels.\nThe sales cycle for Omnis typically ranges from three to nine months or longer. Our products are typically used by application developers, system integrators and value added resellers to develop applications that are critical to their end user\u2019s business. Because our products are often part of an end user\u2019s larger business process, re-engineering initiative, or implementation of client/server or web-based computing, the end users frequently view the purchase of our products as part of a long-term strategic decision regarding the management of their workforce-related operations and expenditures. Thus, this sometimes results in end users taking a significant period of time to assess alternative solutions by competitors or to defer a purchase decision as a result of an unrelated strategic issue beyond our control.\nTHE CONCENTRATION OF OUR STOCK OWNERSHIP GIVES CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OVER OUR BUSINESS.\nAs of March 31, 2015, Astoria Capital Partners, L.P. (\u201cAstoria\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 48.1% of our outstanding common stock. Richard W. Koe, a member of our Board of Directors, serves as the President of Astoria Capital Management, a general partner of Astoria. This concentration of stock ownership allows Astoria to significantly influence any actions that require approval of our stockholders, including the election of members to our Board of Directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. For example, in September and October 2014, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our Bylaws with respect to certain corporate governance matters at the request of, and upon receiving feedback from, Astoria. Moreover, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control. Astoria has announced that it is in the process of winding down and is working on identifying strategic block purchasers for its holdings of our common stock, but the timing and outcome of this process, as well as the impact of the process on our share price, remains uncertain.\nWE MAY EXPERIENCE QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS, RESULTING IN VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE.\nWe expect to continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and operations in order to integrate acquired products and technology and to promote new product development and introduction. Because the expenses associated with these activities are relatively fixed in the short-term, we may be unable to timely adjust spending to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels. Operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as:\n\u00b7 the size and timing of customer orders;\n\u00b7 changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our products;\n\u00b7 changes in deferred revenue balances due to changes in the average duration of subscriptions of our Postano products;\n\u00b7 the success of our strategic partners in referring or reselling our products;\n\u00b7 the number, timing, and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by our competitors;\n\u00b7 the demand for our products;\n\u00b7 non-renewal of customer support agreements;\n\u00b7 software defects and other product quality problems; and\n\u00b7 personnel changes.\nWe operate without a significant backlog of orders. As a result, the quarterly sales and operating results in any given quarter are dependent, in large part, upon the volume and timing of orders booked, products shipped, subscription periods initiated, and professional services rendered during that quarter. Accordingly, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated decrease in orders, sales, subscriptions, or professional services. Therefore, any decline in demand for our products and services, in relation to the forecast for any given quarter, could materially and negatively impact the results of our operations. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, potentially causing our stock price to be volatile. In addition, operating results in any given period should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nTHE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND MANAGEMENT.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to recruit, hire, and retain highly skilled management and employees with experience in engineering, product management, business development, sales, marketing, and customer service. Competition for skilled executive leadership and personnel in the software and social media industry can be intense, and our efforts to recruit and retain these personnel may cause our compensation costs to increase, which could negatively impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. If we are unable to do so, our human resources and staffing levels may be inadequate to develop and license our products, perform services for our customers or successfully manage our operations. In addition, we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions, and other internal and external considerations. Workforce restructurings could result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity, which could negatively affect our revenues and operations.\nTHE INABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operations without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our trademarks include TigerLogic, Postano, Omnis, and Omnis Studio, among others. We have one pending U.S. patent application related to Postano as of May 31, 2015. We have fifteen U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications as of May 31, 2015 related to yolink, a former product offering of the Company. Although we have been issued various patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the\nlaws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products. In addition to trademark and copyright protections, we generally license our products to end users on a \u201cright to use\u201d basis pursuant to license agreements that restrict use of products to a specified number of users or a specified usage.\nWe generally rely on \u201cclick-wrap\u201d licenses that become effective when a customer downloads and installs software on its system or accesses and uses our software. In order to retain exclusive ownership rights to our software and technology, we generally provide our software in object code only, with contractual restrictions on copying, disclosure, and transferability. We generally sell time-based subscriptions to access our hosted Postano platform on a \u201cterms of service\u201d basis. We generally rely on \u201cclick-through\u201d licenses that become effective when the subscription begins and to a lesser extent, master services agreements. We protect our Postano technology by controlling access to the hosted platform; without such access, any links to the platform, such as those in our Postano Social Hub offering, would not function. There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, that our license agreements will be enforceable in the United States or foreign jurisdictions or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\nA BREACH IN INFORMATION PRIVACY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and company data is critically important to us. We utilize customer data captured through our online activities. Our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately safeguard and protect their personal information. A significant breach of customer, employee or company data could damage our reputation and relationships with our customers and could result in lost revenues, fines and/or lawsuits.\nTHIRD PARTIES COULD FILE CLAIMS ASSERTING THAT OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY COSTLY LITIGATION, PRODUCT SHIPMENT DELAYS, PRODUCT LICENSING PROHIBITIONS OR REQUIREMENTS TO ENTER INTO ROYALTY OR LICENSING AGREEMENTS.\nThere has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and online services industry regarding intellectual property rights and there is significant uncertainty in our industry as many of the legal principles associated with software and online services continue to evolve rapidly. Third parties may file claims against us or our customers asserting that our current or potential future products or services, including our acquired products and technologies, infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Third parties on occasion have and may continue to assert that our products and technologies are subject to license requirements. We may be periodically involved in any number of ordinary course of business proceedings of this type. We expect that software product developers and providers of software applications, and online services will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products, services, and competitors in our industry segment grow and the functionality of products and services in different industry segments overlap. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the software field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or be subject to requests for injunctive remedies. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOUR PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN SOFTWARE DEFECTS POTENTIALLY HARMING OUR BUSINESS.\nOur software products may contain undetected errors or failures. This includes our Postano products because they are in the early stages of the product life cycle. This may result in loss of or delay in, customer acceptance of our products and could harm our reputation and our business. Undetected errors or failures in computer software programs are not uncommon.\nThe detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products, including products integrated with our acquired technologies. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. End users who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally. Software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability, performance or warranty claims, as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services.\nIF ASTORIA OR OTHER SECURITIES HOLDERS REQUEST REGISTRATION OF THEIR RESTRICTED SECURITIES OR THESE SECURITIES HOLDERS SELL A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF RESTRICTED SECURITIES IN THE OPEN MARKET, OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had 30,955,697 outstanding shares of common stock, of which approximately 15.3 million shares were restricted securities held by Astoria and other holders. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. At present, all of our outstanding restricted securities may be registered or are eligible for public sale under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to volume limitations and other requirements of Rule 144.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock by Astoria or other securities holders in the public market or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, if we register shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering of securities, we may be required to include shares of restricted securities in the registration, including shares we issued in connection with the Storycode acquisition, possibly adversely affecting our ability to raise capital.\nOUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY.\nWe operate on a global basis with offices or distributors in Europe, Australia, and North America and development efforts in North America and Europe. Approximately 39% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was generated from our international offices. We face several risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 general economic conditions in each country or region;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7 local and governmental requirements;\n\u00b7 political or social unrest;\n\u00b7 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7 differences in intellectual property protections;\n\u00b7 difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u00b7 seasonal business activities in certain parts of the world; and\n\u00b7 trade policies.\nIn addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and also local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.\nCHANGES IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments, including our intercompany cost sharing arrangements and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, we have and may become subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nINEFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. As a smaller reporting company under the SEC rules and regulations, we are currently not subject to the requirements of independent auditor attestation of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting set forth in Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 because the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law on July 21, 2010 permanently exempted companies that are not \u201caccelerated filers\u201d or \u201clarge accelerated filers\u201d under the SEC rules from Section 404(b) requirements. If, in the future, we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company and become an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer (which may occur if the trading price of our stock, and therefore, our public float, increase significantly, as calculated on an annual basis), we will become subject to the requirements of Section 404(b) in such fiscal years. If such audit identifies any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may be required to provide appropriate disclosures and implement costly and time-consuming remedial measures. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nBUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD HURT OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DAMAGING OUR REPUTATION AND HARMING OUR OPERATING RESULTS.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology systems. Our business operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. A portion of our research and development activities and certain other business operations are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nWE OUTSOURCE SOME TECHNOLOGY-RELATED BUSINESS PROCESSES TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO RISKS, INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS IN BUSINESS AND INCREASED COSTS.\nThese outsourced services include credit card authorization and processing, payroll processing, record keeping for retirement and benefit plans and certain information technology functions. In addition, we review outsourcing alternatives on a regular basis and may decide to outsource additional business processes in the future. We try to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.", "PERMNO": 11781, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "TIGR.3"}
