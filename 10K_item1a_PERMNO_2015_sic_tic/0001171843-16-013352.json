RISK FACTORS\nThe following are the most significant factors known to NTIC that could materially adversely affect its business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe termination of NTIC\u2019s joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust and the formation and establishment of NTIC China have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nEffective as of December 31, 2014, NTIC terminated its joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust, initiated the process to liquidate the joint venture entity and established a wholly-owned subsidiary to conduct business in China. NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements include the financial results of NTIC China beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Tianjin Zerust was individually significant to NTIC\u2019s consolidated assets and income. Accordingly, the termination of NTIC\u2019s joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust adversely affected NTIC\u2019s operating results, including in particular, its equity in income, fee income for services provided to joint ventures, and operating expenses during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 since prior to December 31, 2014, NTIC accounted for its investment in Tianjin Zerust in NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements utilizing the equity method of accounting. In addition, during fiscal 2016, NTIC incurred an impairment charge with respect to Tianjin Zerust, which adversely affected NTIC\u2019s operating results for fiscal 2016.\nNTIC anticipates that it will take time to transition Tianjin Zerust customers to NTIC China and no assurance can be provided that NTIC China will be able to achieve the net sales and income levels previously achieved by Tianjin Zerust. NTIC has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant operating expenses associated with NTIC China and the anticipated liquidation of Tianjin Zerust and expects that NTIC\u2019s operating results may continue to be volatile as a result, especially since NTIC has commenced litigation against Mr. Tao Meng, Tianjin Zerust\u2019s other shareholder, and his spouse in order to force the liquidation of Tianjin Zerust. NTIC also has commenced litigation against Cortec Corporation alleging, among other things, that Cortec Corporation aided and abetted breaches of duties and contractual commitments owed to NTIC and NTI Asean related to Tianjin Zerust. During fiscal 2016, NTIC incurred approximately $3,410,000 in expenses related either directly or indirectly to the establishment and initial business operations of NTIC China, the termination of the joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust, NTIC\u2019s ongoing litigation against Mr. Tao Meng and his spouse and NTIC\u2019s ongoing litigation against Cortec Corporation, the creation of a reserve against the accounts receivable balance from Tianjin Zerust, the write-off of certain inventory and the asset impairment of NTIC\u2019s joint venture interest in Tianjin Zerust.\nNTIC\u2019s ongoing litigation is expensive and has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business and operating results.\nDuring fiscal 2015, NTIC commenced litigation against Mr. Tao Meng, Tianjin Zerust\u2019s other shareholder, and his spouse in order to force the liquidation of Tianjin Zerust. NTIC also commenced litigation against Cortec Corporation alleging, among other things, that Cortec Corporation aided and abetted breaches of duties and contractual commitments owed to NTIC and NTI Asean related to Tianjin Zerust. Litigation is expensive and often uncertain. There is no assurance that NTIC will be successful in these litigation matters. In the meantime, NTIC has incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with this ongoing litigation. In addition, the ongoing litigation expense has had and will continue to have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business and operating results so long as it is ongoing.\nAny weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. and world economies continue to suffer from uncertainty, volatility, disruption and other adverse conditions, and those conditions continue to adversely impact the business community and the financial markets. There is no assurance when or the extent to which these economic and business conditions will improve in the future. These adverse economic and financial market conditions may negatively affect NTIC\u2019s customers and its markets, and thus negatively impact its business and operating results. For example, weak market conditions could extend the length of NTIC\u2019s sales cycle and cause potential customers to delay, defer or decline to make purchases of NTIC\u2019s products and services due to uncertainties surrounding the future performance of their businesses, limitations on their capital expenditures due to internal budget constraints, the inability to obtain financing in the capital markets, and the adverse effects of the economy on their business and financial condition. As a result, if economic and financial market conditions continue to be weak or even deteriorate, then NTIC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results, including its ability to grow and expand its business and operations, could be materially and adversely affected.\nNTIC\u2019s operating results are especially dependent upon the economic health of the economies in the United States, Europe and China. Since a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services are sold to customers in the automotive industry, adverse economic conditions affecting the automotive industry again in particular may result in another adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s net sales and its other operating results. Accordingly, any weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nGlobal credit and financial markets in the past have experienced disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations, which if they happen again, could negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny tightening of the credit and financial markets as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis or otherwise could negatively impact the ability of companies to borrow money from their existing lenders, obtain credit from other sources or raise financing to fund their operations. This could negatively impact the ability of NTIC\u2019s customers and the customers of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures to purchase NTIC\u2019s products, suppliers\u2019 ability to provide NTIC and its joint ventures with materials and components and the ability of NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors and sales representatives to finance operations, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any or all of these events could negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Although NTIC maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers, distributors and joint ventures to make required payments and such losses historically have been within NTIC\u2019s expectations and the provisions established, NTIC cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past, especially if there are weaknesses in the worldwide economy. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of NTIC\u2019s customers, distributors or joint ventures could cause unfavorable trends in NTIC\u2019s receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results. In addition, weaknesses in the worldwide economy may adversely impact the ability of suppliers to provide NTIC with materials and components, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business and operating results. NTIC is unable to predict the prospects for a global economic recovery, but the longer the duration of such adverse and uncertain economic conditions, the greater the risks NTIC faces in operating its business.\nNTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position rely on the receipt of fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will continue to receive such fees and dividend distributions in amounts NTIC historically has received or anticipates to receive.\nNTIC conducts business, either directly or indirectly through several joint venture arrangements that operate in North America, Europe and Asia. Each of these joint ventures manufactures, markets and sells finished products in the geographic territory that it is assigned. NTIC\u2019s receipt of funds as a result of sales by its joint ventures is dependent upon NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures and NTIC\u2019s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures based on the profitability of its joint ventures. NTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position rely on NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. During fiscal 2016, NTIC recognized $5,137,710 in fees and $5,503,314 in dividend distributions from its joint ventures. Because NTIC owns 50% or less of each of its joint venture entities, NTIC does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, how much they should be in any given year. Thus, NTIC cannot guarantee that any of its joint ventures will pay dividends in any given year. The failure of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures to declare dividends or the failure of NTIC to receive fees for services provided to joint ventures in amounts typically expected by NTIC could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\nSince a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s earnings results from NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures and since NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures varies from quarter to quarter, NTIC\u2019s earnings are subject to quarterly fluctuations.\nA significant portion of NTIC\u2019s earnings results from NTIC\u2019s equity income from its joint ventures. NTIC\u2019s equity in income from joint ventures consists of NTIC\u2019s share of equity in income from its joint ventures based on the overall profitability of the joint ventures. Such profitability varies from quarter to quarter. Since NTIC\u2019s management typically receives quarterly joint venture financial information after the completion of each fiscal quarter, it is impossible for NTIC\u2019s management to cut costs and expenses to make up for any unanticipated shortfall in NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures. Accordingly, the variability in NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures, in turn, subjects NTIC\u2019s earnings to quarterly fluctuations.\nOut of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures, NTIC\u2019s joint venture in Germany is the most significant in terms of assets and income to NTIC. If sales of NTIC\u2019s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC\u2019s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly, NTIC\u2019s operating results likely would be adversely affected.\nNTIC considers its joint venture in Germany, EXCOR, to be individually significant to NTIC\u2019s consolidated assets and income; and therefore, provides certain additional information regarding this joint venture entity in the notes to NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements and in certain sections of this report. Of the total equity in income from joint ventures of $4,739,704 during fiscal 2016, NTIC had equity in income from joint ventures of $3,534,113 attributable to EXCOR. Of the total fee income for services provided to joint ventures of $5,137,710 during fiscal 2016, fees of $845,857 were attributable to EXCOR. Accordingly, if sales of NTIC\u2019s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC\u2019s relationships with this joint venture or joint venture partner were to deteriorate significantly such that the joint venture is terminated or not motivated to sell NTIC\u2019s products and services, NTIC\u2019s operating results likely would be adversely affected.\nNTIC\u2019s international business, which is conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires management attention and financial resources and exposes NTIC to difficulties and risks presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors.\nNTIC sells products and services directly, through its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and indirectly via a network of joint ventures, independent distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and agents in over 60 countries, including countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. One of NTIC\u2019s strategic objectives is the continued expansion of its international operations. The expansion of NTIC\u2019s existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require management attention and financial resources.\nThe sale and shipping of products and services across international borders subject NTIC to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations. Compliance with such regulations is costly and exposes NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact NTIC include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws restricting business with suspected terrorists and anti-boycott laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact NTIC in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of NTIC\u2019s shipping and sales activities.\nMany of the countries in which NTIC sells its products directly or indirectly through NTIC China, Zerust Brazil, Natur-Tec India, Zerust Mexico, NTI Asean, its joint ventures, distributors, representatives and agents are, to some degree, subject to political, economic and/or social instability. NTIC\u2019s international operations expose NTIC and its joint venture partners, distributors, representatives and agents to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022 difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and the required infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting and information technology;\n\u2022 the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, new trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors, the imposition of costly and lengthy export licensing requirements and changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022 the imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom NTIC does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;\n\u2022 pricing pressure that NTIC or its joint ventures, distributors, representatives and agents may experience internationally;\n\u2022 laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 multiple, changing and often inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations; and\n\u2022 the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on certain earnings of joint ventures upon repatriation.\nFurthermore, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on the movement of goods and people between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could affect NTIC\u2019s ability to sell its products in certain European Union countries. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and Euro. In addition, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to continuing membership with the European Union. NTIC does not know to what extent these changes will impact its business. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that NTIC cannot anticipate, could adversely affect its business, operations and financial results.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject NTIC to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNTIC is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on U.S. publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. NTIC also is subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives and agents operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, based on measurements such as Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index, and NTIC utilizes a number of joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives and agents for whose actions NTIC could be held liable under the FCPA. NTIC informs its personnel, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives and agents of the requirements of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, including, but not limited to their reporting requirements. NTIC also has developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing contracting processes, performing due diligence on agents and improving its recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that NTIC\u2019s employees, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives or other agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by NTIC\u2019s processes and for which NTIC might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anticorruption laws.\nIf NTIC\u2019s employees, joint ventures, distributors, third-party sales representatives or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, NTIC could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to its procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.\nCertain private and foreign companies, including some of NTIC\u2019s competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If NTIC\u2019s competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies or from government officials, giving NTIC\u2019s competitors an advantage in securing business and which would put NTIC at a disadvantage.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC\u2019s earnings and changes in NTIC\u2019s foreign currency translation adjustments.\nBecause the functional currency of NTIC\u2019s foreign operations is the applicable local currency, NTIC is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. NTIC\u2019s principal exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Japanese yen, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Korean won and the English pound against the U.S. dollar. NTIC\u2019s fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from these foreign entities are paid in foreign currencies; and thus, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC\u2019s earnings. Any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change NTIC\u2019s equity in income from joint ventures reflected in its consolidated statements of operations. NTIC does not hedge against its foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nEconomic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s revenue and earnings.\nNTIC conducts business, or is contemplating expansion, in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of doing business in developing markets such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operations and earnings. Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability, fraud or corruption and other non-economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered and retroactively applied. If NTIC is deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where NTIC conducts business, its prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial position. NTIC\u2019s failure to successfully manage economic, political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business.\nNTIC faces intense competition in almost all of its product lines, including from competitors that have substantially greater resources than NTIC does. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s products are sold in intense competitive markets throughout the world. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins and lower market share. The principal competitive factors in NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions markets are pricing, product innovation, quality and reliability, product support, customer service and reputation. Additional competitive factors present in NTIC\u2019s bioplastics business are brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, shelf life and place of manufacture. NTIC often competes with numerous manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly than NTIC to new or emerging technologies, industry trends, and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the markets in which NTIC competes, especially when the barriers to entry are low, which may be true with respect to NTIC\u2019s rust and corrosion prevention business, or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. NTIC\u2019s current products, products under development and its ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable NTIC to compete effectively with its competitors. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results. In particular, NTIC has experienced more intense competition with respect to many of its traditional ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, which have led to decreased pricing and smaller margins for NTIC. NTIC anticipates that such intense competition likely will continue and that new competitors may emerge, including plastic extrusion companies, which would continue to adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s net sales and the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline, NTIC\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\nNTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s net sales and the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures. During fiscal 2016, 83.7% of NTIC\u2019s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. While the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures are not included in NTIC\u2019s net sales on NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements, NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and NTIC\u2019s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures is based primarily on the revenues and profitability of the joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline due to increased competition, the introduction of a new disruptive technology or otherwise, NTIC\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf NTIC is unable to continue to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, NTIC may experience a decrease in demand for its products, and its business could suffer.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s strategies is to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs. NTIC may not be able to compete effectively with its competitors unless NTIC can keep up with existing or new products or alternative technologies in the markets in which it competes. Product development requires significant research and development, financial and other resources. Although in the past NTIC has implemented lean manufacturing and other productivity improvement initiatives to provide investment funding for new products, no assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to continue to do so in the future. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and NTIC may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. NTIC\u2019s competitors\u2019 new products may beat NTIC\u2019s products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than NTIC\u2019s products or render NTIC\u2019s products obsolete. Any new products that NTIC may develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for NTIC relative to its expectations, based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nNTIC has invested and intends to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into the application of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. No assurance can be provided, however, that NTIC\u2019s investments in these new markets and products will be successful and result in additional revenue to NTIC.\nIn an effort to increase net sales, NTIC has expanded the marketing of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. The majority of NTIC\u2019s research and development expense in fiscal 2016 was spent in connection with research and development activities related to these two strategic initiatives. NTIC expects to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into these strategic initiatives. No assurance can be provided, however, that such strategic initiatives will be successful or that NTIC will be successful in obtaining additional revenue as a result of them. The introduction of new products into new markets takes significant resources and there can be no assurance that NTIC is dedicating a sufficient amount of resources to ensure the success of these strategic initiatives. The sale of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services into the oil and gas industry, in particular, typically involves a long sales cycle, often including a one- to multi-year trial period with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. This long sales cycle may cause NTIC\u2019s management, stockholders and investors to lose faith in the business opportunities for NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services in the oil and gas industry.\nThe expansion of NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. In addition, any equity financings may be dilutive to NTIC\u2019s stockholders.\nThe expansion of NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products will continue to require significant resources during fiscal 2017 and beyond. To the extent that NTIC\u2019s existing capital, including amounts available under its revolving line of credit, is insufficient to meet these requirements, NTIC may raise additional capital through financings or additional borrowings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to NTIC and any equity financings could result in dilution to NTIC\u2019s stockholders.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing its launch of its Natur-Tec\u00ae bioplastics resin compounds and finished products is risky and may not prove to be successful, which could harm NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing its launch of its Natur-Tec\u00ae bioplastics resin compounds and finished products, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and independent distributors and agents, is risky and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including:\n\u2022 the absence of a significant operating history;\n\u2022 the lack of commercialized products;\n\u2022 the lack of market acceptance of new products;\n\u2022 expected substantial and continual losses for such businesses for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022 the lack of manufacturing experience and limited marketing experience;\n\u2022 an expected reliance on third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of some of the products;\n\u2022 a competitive environment characterized by numerous, well-established and well-capitalized competitors;\n\u2022 insufficient capital and other resources; and\n\u2022 reliance on key personnel.\nNTIC relies on others for its production and any interruptions of these arrangements could disrupt NTIC\u2019s ability to fill its customers\u2019 orders.\nNTIC utilizes contract manufacturers for a significant portion of its production requirements. The majority of NTIC\u2019s manufacturing is conducted in the United States by contract manufacturers that also perform services for numerous other companies. NTIC does not have a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of its contract manufacturers. Qualifying new contract manufacturers is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. The loss of NTIC\u2019s relationships with its contract manufacturers or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for NTIC as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality and timeliness could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, and thus adversely affect NTIC\u2019s net sales and other operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation.\nNTIC relies on suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in its products. For reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness or availability, NTIC procures certain raw materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers. NTIC generally acquires such raw materials and components through purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business, and as a result, NTIC does not have a significant inventory of these materials and components and does not have any guaranteed or contractual supply arrangements with many of these suppliers for these materials and components. NTIC\u2019s dependence on third-party suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules, as well as manufacturing yields and costs. Suppliers of such raw materials and components may decide, or be required, for reasons beyond NTIC\u2019s control to cease supplying such raw materials and components to NTIC or to raise their prices. Shortages of raw materials, quality control problems, production capacity constraints or delays by suppliers could negatively affect NTIC\u2019s ability to meet its production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts. Any such shortage, constraint or delay may result in delays in shipments of products or components, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s net sales and other operating results, and its reputation. From time to time, materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products are subject to allocation because of shortages of these materials and components. With respect to NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, there are a limited number of suppliers of the base resins used to manufacture NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, and in the past, NTIC has experienced some delay in obtaining such base resins. In addition, a number of raw materials and purchased parts used in NTIC\u2019s rust and corrosion inhibiting products and Natur-Tec\u00ae finished products are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as NTIC\u2019s sole source of supply for these components. Future shortages of materials and components could cause delayed shipments and customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect net sales.\nIncreases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC uses certain raw materials and components in its products, including in particular plastic resins, which are subject to price increases. Increases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s gross margins and other operating results.\nThe commercial success of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with biobased and biodegradable resins.\nAlthough there is a developed market for petroleum-based plastics, the market for \u201cbio-plastics\u201d which are plastics produced with biobased resins, which are derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or plastics that are engineered to be fully biodegradable or both, is still developing. The commercial success of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with biobased and biodegradable resins. It is currently difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities for NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. The traditional plastics market sector is well-established with entrenched competitors with whom NTIC competes. Pricing for traditional plastics has been highly volatile in recent years, which drive, to some extent, the commercial and other support for bioplastics. While NTIC expects to be able to command a premium price for its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, a widening gap in the pricing for bioplastics versus petroleum-based plastics may reduce the size of the addressable market for NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. In addition, the growth of the market will create some pressure on price for applications today considered commodities, including in particular NTIC\u2019s current Natur-Tec\u00ae finished products.\nNTIC\u2019s business, properties and products are subject to governmental regulation and taxes, compliance with which may require NTIC to incur expenses or modify its products or operations, and which may expose NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Governmental regulation also may adversely affect the demand for some of NTIC\u2019s products and its operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s business, properties and products are subject to a wide variety of international, federal, state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources, and worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way NTIC conducts its operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. Because NTIC owns and operates real property, various environmental laws also may impose liability on NTIC for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on NTIC\u2019s property, including releases unknown to NTIC. These environmental laws and regulations also could require NTIC to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where NTIC disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. NTIC\u2019s future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s financial condition and operating results. NTIC is also subject to other international, federal and state laws, rules and regulations, the future non-compliance with which may harm NTIC\u2019s business or may adversely affect the demand for some of its products. Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards and taxation changes, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, revised tax law interpretations, also may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nFluctuations in NTIC\u2019s effective tax rate could have a significant impact on NTIC\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe mix of pre-tax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which NTIC operates that have varying tax rates could impact NTIC\u2019s effective tax rate. NTIC is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest and penalties. Future events could change management\u2019s assessment. NTIC operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. NTIC also has made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by NTIC\u2019s income tax provisions and accruals.\nNTIC may grow its business through additional joint ventures, alliances and acquisitions, which could be risky and harm its business.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s growth strategies may be to expand its business by entering into additional joint ventures and alliances and acquiring businesses, technologies and products that complement or augment NTIC\u2019s existing products. The benefits of a joint venture, alliance or acquisition may take more time than expected to develop, and NTIC cannot guarantee that any future joint ventures, alliances or acquisitions will in fact produce the intended benefits. In addition, joint ventures, alliances and acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022 difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of a new joint venture or acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees or customers of the new joint venture or acquired business or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 adverse impact on overall profitability if the new joint venture or acquired business does not achieve the financial results projected in NTIC\u2019s valuation models;\n\u2022 reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in NTIC\u2019s leverage and debt service requirements to pay the joint venture capital contribution or the acquisition purchase price, which could in turn restrict NTIC\u2019s ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of NTIC\u2019s business strategy;\n\u2022 inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the new joint venture or acquisition; and\n\u2022 incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s ability to grow through joint ventures, alliances and acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable opportunities at an acceptable cost, NTIC\u2019s ability to compete effectively for these opportunities and the availability of capital to complete such transactions.\nNTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and other agents to market and sell its products.\nIn addition to its direct sales force, NTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and other agents to market and sell its products in the United States and internationally. NTIC\u2019s joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and other agents might terminate their relationship with NTIC, or devote insufficient sales efforts to NTIC\u2019s products. NTIC does not control its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and other agents and they may not be successful in implementing NTIC\u2019s marketing plans. NTIC\u2019s failure to maintain its existing relationships with these entities, or its failure to recruit and retain additional skilled joint venture partners, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives and other agents could have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s operations. It is anticipated that several of NTIC\u2019s joint venture partners will retire during the next several years which will require a transition on the part of the joint venture as well as NTIC and could harm NTIC\u2019s relationship with the joint venture and NTIC\u2019s business.\nNTIC may be subject to product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures, which could adversely affect NTIC and its business.\nWhile NTIC is not aware of any specific potential risk beyond its initial investment in and any undistributed earnings of each of its joint ventures, there can be no assurance that NTIC will not be subject to lawsuits based on product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures. To mitigate the ramifications of such an occurrence, NTIC maintains liability insurance specifically applicable to its ownership positions in its joint venture arrangements in excess of any insurance the joint ventures may maintain. No assurance can be provided, however, that such insurance will be available or adequate in the event of a claim.\nThe sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is especially risky in light of the hazards typically associated with such operations and the significant amount of potential liability involved, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business if ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products are involved, even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC\u2019s products.\nBecause NTIC sells its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, NTIC is subject to some of the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations, including hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, unplanned gas releases and spills, each of which could be claimed to be attributed to the failure of NTIC\u2019s products to perform as anticipated. If such events occur and NTIC\u2019s products are involved, NTIC\u2019s business and operating results may suffer even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC\u2019s products.\nThe sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is somewhat seasonal and dependent upon oil prices.\nIn the past, NTIC has experienced some seasonality with respect to the sale of its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, with sales during parts of the second and third fiscal quarters being adversely affected by winter in the United States. In addition, the sale of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry have been and may continue to be hampered by low global crude oil prices, which NTIC believes constrains capital improvement budgets of its existing and prospective customers and may result in personnel turnover at its oil and gas customers or prospects.\nNTIC has limited staffing and will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nNTIC\u2019s success is dependent upon the efforts of a small management team and group of employees. NTIC\u2019s future success will depend in large part on its ability to retain its key employees and identify, attract and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing and customer service personnel when needed. Competition for these individuals may be intense, especially in the markets in which NTIC operates. NTIC may not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining these personnel. NTIC\u2019s current management, other than its President and Chief Executive Officer, does not have any material stock ownership in NTIC. In addition, none of NTIC\u2019s employees has any contractual obligation to maintain his or her employment with NTIC. The loss or interruption of services of any of NTIC\u2019s key personnel, including in particular its technical personnel, the inability to identify, attract or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee slowdowns, strikes or similar actions could make it difficult for NTIC to manage its business and meet key objectives, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nGiven NTIC\u2019s limited resources, it may not effectively manage its growth.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy to grow its business, including in particular its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec\u00ae bio-plastic resin compounds and finished products, requires significant management time and operational and financial resources. There is no assurance that NTIC has the necessary operational and financial resources to manage its growth. This is especially true as it expands facilities and manufactures its products on a larger commercial scale. In addition, rapid growth in NTIC\u2019s headcount and operations may place a significant strain on its management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Failure to adequately manage its growth could have a material and adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. For example, NTIC\u2019s soil side bottom solutions for tanks require implementation teams comprised of both internal NTIC personnel and outside consulting firms. NTIC\u2019s failure to expand these implementation teams to service additional customers may limit NTIC\u2019s ability to grow this business. In addition, NTIC may not be successful in its strategy to grow its business.\nCertain of NTIC\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe manufacture, sale and use of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae bio-plastic resin compounds are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA. The FDA\u2019s regulations are concerned with substances used indirectly in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers: (i) are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations; or (ii) are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds are in compliance with all FDA requirements. However, failure to comply with FDA regulations could subject NTIC to administrative, civil or criminal penalties.\nNTIC relies on its management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. If these information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if NTIC experiences an interruption in their operation, NTIC\u2019s business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of NTIC\u2019s business is dependent on its management information systems. NTIC relies on its management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions; manage order entry, order fulfillment and inventory replenishment processes; and to maintain its research and development data. The failure of management information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt NTIC\u2019s business and product development and could result in decreased sales, causing NTIC\u2019s business and operating results to suffer. In addition, NTIC\u2019s management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers, or power loss or computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure. Any such interruption could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business and operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s reliance upon patents, trademark laws, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect its intellectual property from others who may sell similar products.\nNTIC holds patents relating to various aspects of its products and believes that proprietary technical know-how is critical to many of its products. Proprietary rights relating to NTIC\u2019s products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. NTIC cannot be certain that it will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to NTIC or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology. In the absence of patent protection, NTIC may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy NTIC\u2019s products or gain access to its trade secrets and know-how. NTIC\u2019s competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of NTIC\u2019s patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe NTIC\u2019s patents. NTIC may incur substantial costs if its competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of its patents or if it initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to NTIC, its business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, NTIC relies substantially on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that it seeks to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached and NTIC may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, NTIC\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nNTIC may not achieve its annual financial guidance or projected goals and objectives in the time periods that NTIC anticipates or announces publicly, which could have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business and could cause its stock price to decline.\nOn a quarterly basis, NTIC typically provides projected annual financial information, including its anticipated annual net sales and net earnings. These financial projections are based on management\u2019s then current expectations and typically do not contain any margin of error or cushion for any specific uncertainties, or for the uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting. The failure to achieve such financial projections could have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, disappoint investors and analysts and cause its stock price to decline.\nNTIC also sets goals and objectives for, and makes public statements regarding, the timing of certain accomplishments and milestones regarding its business, such as its progress in selling its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to customers in the oil and gas industry, the progress and timing of its various field trials with prospective customers in the oil and gas industry, its ability to increase sales of its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, and other developments and milestones. The actual timing of these events can vary dramatically due to a number of factors including without limitation the timing of the receipt of purchase orders, delays or failures in current field trials, the amount of time, effort and resources committed to the sales and marketing of NTIC\u2019s products and services by NTIC and its current and potential future distributors and agents and the uncertainties inherent in introducing new products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance that NTIC will succeed in achieving its projected goals and objectives in the time periods that NTIC anticipates or announces publicly. The failure to achieve such projected goals and objectives in the time periods that NTIC anticipates or announces publicly could have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, disappoint investors and analysts and cause its stock price to decline.\nNTIC\u2019s quarterly results are typically unpredictable and subject to variation.\nNTIC\u2019s quarterly operating results vary from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons. For example, NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales to joint ventures can be affected by individual orders to joint ventures. Because of the typical size of individual orders to joint ventures and overall size of NTIC\u2019s net sales to joint ventures, the timing of one or more orders can affect materially NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales to joint ventures and the comparisons to prior year quarters. In addition, because of the typical size of individual orders and overall size of NTIC\u2019s net sales derived from sales of Natur-Tec\u00ae products, the timing of one or more orders can affect materially NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales of Natur-Tec\u00ae products and the comparisons to prior year quarters. Furthermore, since ZERUST\u00ae products for the oil and gas industry typically carry higher margins than other traditional ZERUST\u00ae products, the amount of sales of ZERUST\u00ae products for the oil and gas industry typically affects NTIC\u2019s overall margins. Such variability in operating results makes the prediction of NTIC\u2019s net sales, earnings and other operating results for each quarter difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly operating results. NTIC\u2019s quarterly results have been and in the future may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nNTIC is exposed to risks relating to its evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related and other regulations implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market, are challenging for small publicly-held companies, including NTIC. NTIC\u2019s efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, significant general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, NTIC\u2019s efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding NTIC\u2019s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting have required and will continue to require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Although NTIC\u2019s management has concluded that NTIC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2016, no assurance can be provided that NTIC\u2019s management will reach a similar conclusion as of any later date. NTIC\u2019s failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on its stock price.\nNTIC\u2019s compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and any changes in such principles might adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Any requirement to consolidate NTIC\u2019s joint ventures or subject them to compliance with the internal control provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIf there were a change in accounting rules and NTIC were required to fully consolidate its joint ventures or if NTIC\u2019s joint ventures otherwise would be required to be consolidated with NTIC or be in compliance with the internal control provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, NTIC and the individual joint venture would incur significant additional costs. In addition, other accounting pronouncements issued in the future could have a material cost associated with NTIC\u2019s implementation of such new accounting pronouncements.\nNTIC\u2019s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results, financial condition or business.\nNTIC\u2019s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results, financial condition or business, such as natural or man-made disasters or global pandemics that may result in shortages of raw materials, higher commodity costs, an increase in insurance premiums and other adverse effects on NTIC\u2019s business; the continued threat of terrorist acts and war that may result in heightened security and higher costs for import and export shipments of components or finished goods; and the ability of NTIC\u2019s management to adapt to unplanned events.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Common Stock\nThe trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock is typically very low, leaving NTIC\u2019s common stock open to risk of high volatility.\nThe number of shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock being traded on a daily basis is often very low and on some trading days, there is no trading volume at all. During fiscal 2016, the daily trading volume ranged from zero shares to 51,700 shares. Any NTIC stockholder wishing to sell his, her or its stock may cause a significant fluctuation in the trading price of NTIC\u2019s common stock. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. NTIC may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation in its common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock price historically has fluctuated over a wide range. During fiscal 2016, the sale price of NTIC\u2019s common stock ranged from a low of $9.60 per share to a high of $18.00 per share, and the daily trading volume ranged from zero shares to 51,700 shares. It is likely that the price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. The securities of small capitalization companies, including NTIC, from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations, often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Securities class action litigation is sometimes brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or for other reasons. NTIC may become the target of similar litigation, especially if NTIC fails to meet its annual projected financial guidance or lower its annual projected financial guidance. Securities litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as the market price of its common stock.\nA large percentage of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for NTIC\u2019s common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nAs of November 15, 2016, NTIC had 4,535,070 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 19.6% of these outstanding shares were beneficially owned by directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their respective affiliates. The stock of companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders is usually not as liquid as the stock of other public companies where insider ownership is not as concentrated. Thus, the trading market for shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock may not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about NTIC\u2019s business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding NTIC\u2019s common stock, the market price for NTIC\u2019s common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for NTIC\u2019s common stock has been influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about NTIC or its business. If one or more analysts who cover NTIC downgrade NTIC\u2019s common stock, the market price for NTIC\u2019s common stock would likely decline. If one or more cease coverage of NTIC or fail to regularly publish reports on NTIC, NTIC could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for NTIC\u2019s common stock to decline.\nNTIC does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough in the past NTIC has paid dividends on its common stock, NTIC has not done so since fiscal 2005. The payment of any future dividends will be determined by NTIC\u2019s Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including NTIC\u2019s earnings (if any), financial condition, cash requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. NTIC\u2019s Board of Directors currently does not anticipate paying a dividend on NTIC\u2019s common stock in the near future, but rather intends to retain all of its earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of its business. As a result, NTIC\u2019s stockholders will only receive a return on their investment in NTIC\u2019s common stock if the market price of NTIC\u2019s common stock increases.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s principal stockholders beneficially owns a significant percentage of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock and is affiliated with NTIC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and thus may be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, and could discourage or otherwise impede a transaction in which a third party wishes to purchase NTIC\u2019s outstanding shares at a premium.\nAs of November 15, 2016, Inter Alia Holding Company, or Inter Alia, beneficially owned approximately 13.3% of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock. Inter Alia is an entity partially owned by G. Patrick Lynch, NTIC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, as well as three other members of the Lynch family. Mr. Lynch shares voting and dispositive power of shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock held by Inter Alia with the other owners. As a result of his share ownership through Inter Alia and his position as President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of NTIC, Mr. Lynch may be able to influence the affairs and actions of NTIC, including matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of Mr. Lynch and Inter Alia may differ from the interests of NTIC\u2019s other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of NTIC, could deprive NTIC\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of NTIC and may negatively affect the market price of NTIC\u2019s common stock. Transactions that could be affected by this concentration of ownership include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 77488, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "NTIC"}
