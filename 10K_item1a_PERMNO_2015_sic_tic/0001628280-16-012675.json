{"cik": "275053", "company": "NATURES SUNSHINE PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating the Company and its business. The risks described below are the risks that the Company currently believes are material to its business. However, additional risks not presently known to the Company, or risks that it currently believes are not material, may also impair its business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including the information set forth in \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d as well as the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The Company's business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If the Company is adversely affected by such risks, then the market price of its common stock could decline.\nChanges in laws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict the Company's ability to sell its products in some markets.\nDirect selling systems are subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies throughout the world. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to ensure that sales are made to consumers of the products, and that compensation, recognition and advancement within the selling organization are based upon sales of the products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. Violations could result from misconduct by an associate, ambiguity in statutes, changes or new laws and regulations affecting Nature Sunshine's business and court-related decisions. Furthermore, the Company may be restricted or prohibited from using direct selling plans in some foreign countries. In addition, changes in existing laws or additional regulations could make it difficult to register or sell the Company's products in the countries in which it operates. For example, in Peru, changes in local regulations restricted the Company's ability to sell a majority of its key products in this market through its traditional direct selling business model. In response to this change in regulations, in 2014, the Company transitioned this market to an export market, in which it sells its products to a locally managed entity independent of the Company that has distribution rights for the market.\nThe Company's products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulations and could be subject to additional laws and regulations.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sales of each of the Company\u2019s major product groups are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign governmental agencies and authorities. In the U.S., these governmental agencies and authorities include the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, the USDA and state regulatory agencies. In September 2015, the New York Attorney General issued a cease and desist letter to the Company and many other national retailers, related to the sale of a common herbal supplement known as Devil\u2019s Claw. In the letter, the New York Attorney General requested, among other things, that the Company provide certain information with respect to the Company\u2019s manufacture and sale of Devil\u2019s Claw products. Although the Company believes it is lawfully selling Devil\u2019s Claw products, the letters that it and other retailers received, demonstrate a focus by the New York Attorney General and other states\u2019 Attorneys General on the manufacture and sale of various dietary supplements. As a result of such focus, such states\u2019 Attorneys General could seek to take actions against the Company or other industry participants or amend applicable regulations in their State.\nGenerally, each international market in which the Company operates has regulatory agencies similar to the regulatory agencies in the U.S. These markets have varied regulations which often require it to reformulate products for specific markets,\nconform product labeling to market regulations and register or qualify products or obtain necessary approvals with the applicable governmental authorities in order to market its products in these markets. Failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of these various governmental agencies and authorities could result in enforcement actions including: cease and desist orders, injunctions, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestitures of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these regulations could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against the Company could materially affect its ability to successfully market its products.\nIn the future, the Company may be subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, the repeal or amendment of laws or regulations which it considers favorable and/or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. The Company can neither predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on its business. They could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, imposition of additional record-keeping requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or altered labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all such requirements could increase the Company's costs of operating the business and have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of the Company\u2019s products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. The Company cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question its advertising or other operations in the future. It is unclear whether the FTC will subject the Company\u2019s advertisements to increased surveillance to ensure compliance with the principles set forth in its published advertising guidance.\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. A finding of FCPA noncompliance could subject the Company to, among other things, significant penalties and legal expenses, as well as reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business in a particular market or in general. Assertions that the Company failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect it in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain distributors, its business could suffer.\nAs a direct selling company, the Company relies on its independent distributors to market and sell its products. Many independent distributors sell the Company's products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products for themselves. The Company's independent distributors may terminate their service at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, the Company experiences high turnover among its independent distributors from year to year. As a result, the Company needs to retain existing independent distributors and continue to attract additional independent distributors in order to maintain and/or increase sales in the future.\nSeveral factors affect the Company's ability to attract and retain independent distributors, including:\n\u2022\nany adverse publicity regarding the Company, its products, its distribution channels or its competitors;\n\u2022\non-going motivation of Company's independent distributors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions about the value and efficacy of the Company's products;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions and acceptance of direct selling;\n\u2022\ngeneral and economic business conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges to the Company's compensation arrangements, training and support for its independent distributors; and\n\u2022\ncompetition in recruiting and retaining independent distributors and/or market saturation.\nThe Company cannot provide any assurance that its independent distributors will continue to maintain their current levels of productivity, or that it will be able to retain existing independent distributors, or attract additional independent distributors, in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain present sales levels.\nDifficult economic conditions could harm the Company's business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the Company's products, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel prices, salaries and wages, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. Economic slowdowns in the markets in which the Company does business may adversely affect consumer spending habits and demand for the Company's products, which may result in lower net sales of the Company's products in future periods. A prolonged global or regional economic downturn could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operation or cash flows. For example, recent economic declines in Mainland China's stock market and other negative economic indicators have caused uncertainty regarding the potential for growth in Mainland China's economy. Continued declines in economic conditions in Mainland China could negatively impact the Company's business prospects in that market and in other markets globally.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect the Company's net revenue and net income.\nIn 2015, the Company recognized approximately 54.6 percent of its revenue in markets outside the United States, the majority of which was recognized in each market\u2019s respective local currency. The Company purchases inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing its financial statements, the Company translates revenues and expenses in foreign countries from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Because a majority of its sales are in foreign countries, exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on its sales and earnings. The Company reported net earnings have in the past been, and are likely to continue to be, significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with net sales revenue and earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar. These fluctuations had a generally negative effect on the Company's revenue in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. As the Company's operations grow in countries where foreign currency transactions are made, its operating results will increasingly be subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations, and it may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on the Company's future results of operations or financial condition.\nSome of the markets in which the Company operates may become highly inflationary.\nInflation is another risk associated with the Company's international operations. For example, in 2010, prior to the discontinuation of the Company's operations in Venezuela, the Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). A country is considered to have a highly inflationary economy if, among other qualitative factors, it has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. The functional currency in a highly inflationary economy is the U.S. dollar. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's financial statements and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses were reflected in the Company's earnings, which resulted in volatility within the its earnings, rather than as a component of comprehensive income within shareholders\u2019 equity. It could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations if the economy of other countries in which the Company does business are designated as highly inflationary.\nSome of the markets in which the Company operates have currency controls in place which may restrict the repatriation of cash.\nThe possibility that foreign governments may impose currency remittance restrictions is another risk faced by the Company's international operations. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company may not be able to repatriate cash at exchange rates beneficial to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in 2014, the Company discontinued its operations in Venezuela due to the difficulties and uncertainties related to import controls, difficulties associated with repatriating cash and high inflation.\nAvailability and integrity of raw materials could become compromised.\nThe Company acquires all of its raw materials for the manufacture of its products from third-party suppliers. If the Company was to lose a significant supplier and experience difficulties in finding or transitioning to an alternative supplier, the Company could experience shortages or product back orders, which could harm its business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide the Company with the raw materials in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that it requests or at a price that it is willing to pay. The Company is also subject to the delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nOccasionally, the Company's suppliers have experienced production difficulties with respect to its products, including the delivery of materials or products that do not meet the Company's quality control standards. These quality problems have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, stock outages or shortages of the Company's products, and could harm its sales and create inventory write-offs for unusable product.\nGeopolitical issues and conflicts could adversely affect the Company's business.\nBecause a substantial portion of the Company's business is conducted outside of the United States, its business is subject to global political issues and conflicts. If these conflicts or issues escalate, it could harm the Company's foreign operations. In addition, changes in and actions by governments in foreign markets could harm its business. For example, the Company has cautioned that it anticipates sales in its NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment to continue to be affected by the political unrest in Ukraine and Russia, possible sanctions in Russia and the impact of currency devaluation.\nThe Company's business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception.\nThe Company's ability to attract and retain independent distributors, as well as its ability to maintain or grow sales in the future, may be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception with regard to its industry, its competition, its direct selling model, the quality or efficacy of nutritional product supplements and ingredients, and its business generally. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that it would not have an adverse or material negative impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTaxation and transfer pricing affect the Company's operations.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in many international markets, the Company is subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between the parent Company and its subsidiaries. These pricing laws are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income and expense are reported by its U.S. and foreign entities, and that they are taxed appropriately. Regulators in the United States and in foreign markets closely monitor the Company's corporate structures, intercompany transactions, and how it effectuates intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge the Company's corporate structures, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, its operations may be harmed, and its effective tax rate may increase. The Company is eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for certain foreign taxes actually paid abroad. In the event any audits or assessments are concluded adversely to the Company, it may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, the Company cannot be sure that it would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing, and are subject to the interpretation of governmental agencies.\nThe Company collects and remits value-added taxes and sales taxes in jurisdictions and states in which it has determined that nexus exists. Other states may claim, from time to time, that the Company has state-related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require such collection.\nDespite the Company's efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws and changes to the interpretations thereof, there is a risk that it may not continue to operate in compliance with such laws. The Company may need to adjust its operating procedures in response to these interpretational changes, and such changes could have a material negative impact on its financial position, results of operation or cash flows.\nThe Company's business is subject to intellectual property risks.\nMost of the Company's products are not protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products generally make obtaining patent protection for the Company's products impractical. The Company has other intellectual property that it considers valuable, including trademarks for the Nature\u2019s Sunshine Products name and logo as well as the Synergy WorldWide name. The Company's efforts to protect its intellectual property may be unsuccessful and third parties may assert claims against the Company for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in the Company being required to obtain costly licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate its manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nProduct liability claims could harm the Company's business.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products that are ingested, the Company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products is alleged to results in injury to consumers. The Company has historically had a very limited number of product liability claims or reports from individuals who have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using its products. The Company has established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to provide it with product liability insurance coverage, and has accrued a reserve that it believes is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon the Company's history. Such reserve may prove to be insufficient if the outcome of a product liability claim against the Company is beyond our estimate of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities, which could have a material negative impact on the Company's business prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInventory obsolescence due to finite shelf lives could adversely affect the Company's business.\nTo provide a high level of product availability to its independent distributors and customers, the Company generally maintains a considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which it does business. The Company's inventories of both raw materials and finished goods have finite shelf lives. If the Company overestimates the demand for its products, the Company could experience significant write-downs of its inventory due to obsolescence. Such write-downs could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of data could expose the Company to data loss, litigation and liability, and the Company's reputation could be significantly harmed.\nThe Company collects and retains large volumes of data from employees and independent distributors, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and its various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to the Company's business. The Company is subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the credit card industry. Maintaining compliance with these evolving regulations and requirements could be difficult and may increase the Company's expenses. In addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, distributor or guest data which could harm the Company's reputation, disrupt its operations, or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits.\nSystem failures could harm the Company's business.\nLike many companies, the Company's business is highly dependent upon its information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently the Company's operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurately tracking purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrences of natural disasters, security breaches or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in the Company's day-to-day operations that could adversely affect its business. A long-term failure or impairment of any of the Company's information systems could adversely affect its ability to conduct its day-to-day business.\nBeginning in 2013, the Company began to significantly reinvest in information technology systems. Included within this plan is an Oracle ERP implementation program to provide the Company with a single integrated software solution that will\nintegrate the Company\u2019s business process on a worldwide basis. The unsuccessful implementation or failure of this ERP program could disrupt or adversely affect the Company's operations.\nThe Company could incur obligations relating to the activities of its independent distributors and contracted third-parties.\nThe Company sells its products worldwide to a sales force of independent distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to customers. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the Company contracts with third-parties to distribute its product and provide support services to its independent distributors. Independent distributors and contracted third-parties are not employees and operate their own business separate and apart from the Company, and the Company may not be able to control aspects of their activities that may impact its business. If local laws and regulations or the interpretation of locals laws and regulations change and require the Company to treat its independent distributors as employees, or if its independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates to be its employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, the Company may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment related taxes and penalties. The Company's independent distributors also operate in jurisdictions where local legislation and governmental agencies require it to collect and remit taxes such as sales tax or value-added taxes. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold the Company responsible for false product claims or the actions of an independent distributor. If the Company were found to be responsible for any of these issues related to its independent distributors, it could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf the Company's independent distributors fail to comply with advertising laws, then its financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nThe advertisement of the Company's products is subject to extensive regulations in most of the markets in which the Company does business, including the United States. The Company's independent distributors may fail to comply with such regulations governing the advertising of the Company's products. In the U.S., the Company's products are sold principally as dietary supplements and cosmetics and are subject to rigorous FDA regulations limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made relating to the products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for the Company's products. Despite the Company's efforts to train its independent distributors and its attempts to monitor its independent distributors\u2019 marketing materials, the Company cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations, including bans on therapeutic claims. If the Company's independent distributors fail to comply with these restrictions, then the Company and its independent distributors could be subjected to claims of false advertising, significant financial penalties, costly mandatory product recalls or relabeling requirements, any of which could harm the Company's financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in key management could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company believes its success depends in part on its ability to retain its executive officers, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to its management team. The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers. The Company cannot guarantee the continued service of its key officers. The loss or limitation of any of its executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company does not carry key man insurance on the lives of any of its executive officers.\nThe Company's business is involved in an industry with intense competition.\nThe Company operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of nutritional products. The market for these products is intensely competitive. Many of the Company's competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have better name recognition than it does. The Company also relies on independent distributors to market and sell its products through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent distributors. The Company's ability to compete with other direct selling companies depends greatly on its ability to retain existing independent distributors and attract new independent distributors. In addition, the Company currently does not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and competitors may introduce products with the same or similar ingredients that the Company uses in its products. As a result, the Company may have difficulty differentiating its products from its competitors\u2019 product and other competing products that enter the nutritional market. The Company's future operations could be harmed as a result of changing market conditions and future competition.\nThe Company may experience unintended negative effects from its independent distributor promotions or compensation plans.\nThe payment of volume incentives to the Company's independent distributors is its most significant expense. These incentives include commissions, bonuses and certain awards and prizes based on promotions and product sales levels. From time to time, the Company adjusts its compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales. The Company closely monitors the amount of volume incentives that are paid as a percentage of net sales, and may periodically adjust its compensation plan to prevent volume incentives from having a significant adverse effect on the Company's earnings. In addition to the compensation plan, the Company frequently designs and implements economic and non-economic incentives and promotions to motivate and reward its independent distributors. Changes to the Company's compensation plan, product pricing, or promotions and incentives may not be successful in achieving target levels of volume incentives as a percentage of net sales. Furthermore, such programs, promotions or incentives could result in unintended or unforeseen negative economic and non-economic consequences to the Company's business, such as higher than anticipated costs.\nThe Company's manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nThe Company manufacture approximately 80 percent of the products sold at its manufacturing facility located in Spanish Fork, Utah. As a result, the Company is dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of its manufacturing facility in Spanish Fork and its distribution facilities throughout the country. The Company's manufacturing facilities and distribution facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to, among other things, earthquake, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as occurrence of significant equipment failures. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it would be expected to disrupt the Company's operations and could result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with its customers or result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts.\nAs the primary manufacturer of its own products, the Company is subject to FDA regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices, which require the Company to maintain good manufacturing processes, including ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. The ingredient identification requirement, which requires the Company to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on its product labels within a narrow range, is particularly burdensome and difficult for the Company with respect to its product formulations, which contain many different ingredients. The Company's operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that the Company is not in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting the Company's ability to continue selling certain products. In addition, compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of the Company's products.\nIn addition, the Company contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce some of its vitamins, mineral and other nutritional supplements, personal care products and certain other miscellaneous products in accordance with the Company's specifications and standards. These contract manufacturers are subject to the same risks as the Company's manufacturing facility as noted above. In addition, while the Company has implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that its contract manufacturers comply with its specifications and standards, the Company does not have full control over their manufacturing activities. Any difficulties, delays and defects in the Company's products resulting from the activities of its contract manufacturers may have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nFailure of third party support could negatively impact the Company's sales revenue and profitability.\nThe Company has contracted with third-parties in several of its key markets to distribute its product and provide support services to the Company's independent sales force of independent distributors. The Company relies on these third parties to perform various required administrative functions in support of its independent distributors. Any failure of these third parties in this regard could result in the disruption of the Company's business in these markets and adversely affect revenue and profitability.\nThe Company's failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm its distributor relationships and product sales and harm its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company's business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. The Company's continued success depends in part on its ability to anticipate and react to these changes, and the Company may not react in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. Furthermore, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements. The Company's failure to\naccurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of its products, which in turn could harm its relationships with its independent distributors and cause the loss of sales. If the Company does not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of its customers in a timely manner, some of its products could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact the Company's revenues, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company's expansion in China is subject to risks associated with operating a joint venture, as well as general, industry-specific, economic, political, currency and legal risks in China and requires it to utilize a different business model from that which it uses elsewhere in the world.\nThe Company's expansion of operations into China is subject to risks and uncertainties related to operating a joint venture, as well as general economic, political and legal developments in China, among other things. The Chinese government exercises significant control over all aspects of the Chinese economy, and the direct selling industry in particular. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese economy, the Chinese legal system or Chinese governmental, economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business in China and its prospects generally.\nOn August 25, 2014, the Company completed a transaction with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d), which created a joint venture owned 80 percent by the Company and 20 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun Pharma. Smooth operation of the joint venture depends on good relations between the Company and Fosun Pharma, active synergies between the two companies and positive legal and regulatory recognition of the joint venture. Any disruption in relations, inability to work efficiently or disadvantageous treatment of the joint venture by the Chinese or other authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business in China and its prospects generally.\nIn 2005, China published regulations governing direct selling and prohibiting pyramid promotional schemes, and a number of administrative methods and proclamations were issued in 2005 and in 2006. These regulations require the Company to use a business model different from that which it offers in other markets. The Company is creating a model specifically for China to operate under these regulations.\nThe direct selling regulations require the Company to apply for various approvals to conduct a direct selling enterprise in China. The process for obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct a direct selling business is protracted and cumbersome and involves multiple layers of Chinese governmental authorities and numerous governmental employees at each layer. While direct selling licenses are centrally issued, such licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained. Such approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases, and the approval process requires involvement with multiple ministries at each level. The Company's participation and conduct during the approval process is guided not only by distinct Chinese practices and customs, but is also subject to applicable laws of China and the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the U.S., as well as the Company's internal code of ethics. There is always a risk that in attempting to comply with local customs and practices in China during the application process or otherwise, the Company will fail to comply with requirements applicable in China itself or in other jurisdictions, and any such failure to comply with applicable requirements could prevent the Company from obtaining the direct selling licenses or related local or provincial approvals. Furthermore, the Company relies on certain key management, regulatory and legal personnel in China to assist during the approval process, and the loss of any such key personnel could delay or hinder the Company's ability to obtain licenses or related approvals. For all of the above reasons, there can be no assurance that the Company will obtain direct-selling licenses, or obtain related approvals to expand into any or all of the localities or provinces in China that are important to this venture. The Company's inability to obtain, retain, or renew any or all of the licenses or related approvals that are required to operate in China could negatively impact the Company.\nAdditionally, although certain regulations have been published with respect to obtaining and operating under such approvals and otherwise conducting business in China, other regulations are pending and there continues to be uncertainty regarding the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese regulations. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. The Company cannot be certain that its business model will continue to be deemed compliant by national or local Chinese regulatory authorities. The Chinese government rigorously monitors the direct selling market in China, and in the past has taken serious action against companies that the government believed were engaging in activities they regarded to be in violation of applicable law, including shutting down their businesses and imposing substantial fines. As a result, there can be no guarantee that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of the existing and new regulations will not negatively impact the Company's business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nChinese regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. The Company cannot guarantee that any of its Members living outside of China or any of its sales representatives or independent\nservice providers in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate the Company's policies in this market, or that violate Chinese law or other applicable law, and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity.\nIf the Company is not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, its business could be harmed.\nThe Company's registration of its products for sale in China is extremely time intensive. The requirements for obtaining product registrations and/or licenses involve extended periods of time that may delay the Company from offering products for sale or prevent it from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in China as \u201chealth foods\u201d or for which certain claims are used are subject to \u201cblue cap\u201d or \u201cblue hat\u201d registrations, which involve extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by governmental authorities. This registration process can take anywhere from 18 months to 3 years, but may be substantially longer. The Company currently intends to market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in China. There is risk associated with the common practice in China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of products is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit the Company's ability to market such products in China.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively manage rapid growth in China, its operations could be harmed.\nIf the Company's operations in China are successful and it experiences rapid growth, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully manage rapid expansion of manufacturing operations and a rapidly growing and dynamic sales force. If the Company is unable to effectively manage such growth and expansion of its retail stores and manufacturing operations, the Company's government relations may be compromised and its operations in China may be harmed.", "PERMNO": 56945, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NATR"}
