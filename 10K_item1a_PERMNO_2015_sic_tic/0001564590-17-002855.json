{"cik": "1669811", "company": "Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nA significant part of our business is derived from the use of our products and services in connection with financial and strategic business transactions. Economic trends that affect the volume of these transactions may negatively impact the demand for our products and services.\nA significant portion of our net sales depends on the purchase of our products and use of our services by parties involved in GCM compliance and transactions. As a result, our business is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts, bankruptcy and claims processing and other transactions. These transactions are often tied to economic conditions and dependent upon the performance of the overall economy, and the resulting volume of these types of transactions drives demand for our products and services. Downturns in the financial markets, global economy or in the economies of the geographies in which we do business and reduced equity valuations all create risks that could negatively impact our business. For example, in the past, economic volatility has led to a decline in the financial condition of a number of our clients and led to the postponement of their capital markets transactions. To the extent that there is continued volatility, we may face increasing volume pressure. Furthermore, our offerings for GIM clients can be affected by fluctuations in the inflow and outflow of money into investment management funds which determines the number of new funds that are opened, as well as, closed. As a result, we are not able to predict the impact any potential worsening of macroeconomic conditions could have on our results of operations. The level of activity in the financial communications services industry, including the financial transactions and related compliance needs our products and services are used to support, is sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, our clients\u2019 competitive environments, business trends, terrorism and political change. In addition, a weak economy could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by clients. Failure of our clients to pay the amounts owed to us, or to pay such amounts in a timely manner, may increase our exposure to credit risks and result in bad debt write-offs. Unfavorable conditions or changes in any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe quality of our customer support and services offerings is important to our clients, and if we fail to offer high quality customer support and services, clients may not use our solutions and our net sales may decline.\nA high level of customer support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we are unable to provide a level of customer support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our clients, we could experience a loss of clients and market share, a failure to attract new clients, including in new geographic regions and increased service and support costs and a diversion of resources. Any of these results could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nA substantial part of our business depends on clients continuing their use of our products and services. Any decline in our client retention would harm our future operating results.\nWe do not have long term contracts with most of our GCM and GIM clients, and therefore rely on their continued use of our products and services, particularly for compliance related services. As a result, client retention, particularly during periods of declining transactional volume, is an important part of our strategic business plan. There can be no assurance that our clients will continue to use our products and services to meet their ongoing needs, particularly in the face of competitors\u2019 products and services offerings. Our client retention rates may decline due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to our clients the value of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing products and services;\n\u2022\nour clients\u2019 ceasing to use or anticipating a declining need for our services in their operations;\n\u2022\nconsolidation in our client base;\n\u2022\nthe effects of economic downturns and global economic conditions; or\n\u2022\nreductions in our clients\u2019 spending levels.\nIf our retention rates are lower than anticipated or decline for any reason, our net sales may decrease and our profitability may be harmed, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nOur business may be adversely affected by new technologies enabling clients to produce and file documents on their own.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected as clients seek out opportunities to produce and file regulatory documentation on their own and begin to implement technologies that assist them in this process. For example, clients and their financial advisors have increasingly relied on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute reports required pursuant to the Exchange Act, prospectuses and other materials as a replacement for using our EDGAR filing services. If technologies are further developed to provide our clients with the ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations, and we do not develop products or provide services to compete with such new technologies, our business may be adversely affected by those clients who choose alternative solutions, including self-serving or filing themselves.\nOur performance and growth depend on our ability to generate client referrals and to develop referenceable client relationships that will enhance our sales and marketing efforts.\nWe depend on users of our solutions to generate client referrals for our services. We depend in part on the financial institutions, law firms and other third parties who use our products and services to recommend our solutions to their client base, which allows us to reach a larger client base than we can reach through our direct sales and internal marketing efforts. For instance, a portion of our net sales from GCM clients is derived from referrals by investment banks, financial advisors and law firms that have utilized our services in connection with prior transactions. These referrals are an important source of new clients for our services.\nA decline in the number of referrals we receive could require us to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our services, which would increase our costs, potentially lead to a decline in our net sales, slow our growth and negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last up to two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the United Kingdom determines which European Union-derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flow.\nAs part of RRD, we received favorable terms and prices from existing third-party vendors that we source products and services from based on the full purchasing power of RRD. Following the Separation, we are a smaller company and may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in purchasing power.\nPrior to the Separation, we were able to take advantage of RRD\u2019s size and purchasing power in sourcing products and services from third-party vendors. Following the Separation, we are a smaller company and are unlikely to have the same purchasing power that we had as part of RRD. Although we are seeking to expand our direct purchasing relationships with many of our most important third-party vendors, we may be unable to obtain products and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the Separation, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flow.\nThe spin-off from RRD could result in significant liability to Donnelley Financial.\nThe spin-off was intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to RRD and its stockholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the spin-off was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the spin-off. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the spin-off was also conditioned upon RRD\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by RRD, Donnelley Financial and LSC. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the spin-off, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.\nIf the Separation is determined to be taxable, RRD and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement, Donnelley Financial may be required to indemnify RRD for any liabilities incurred by RRD if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by Donnelley Financial following the spin-off. For additional detail, refer to Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe tax rules applicable to the Separation may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Separation from RRD under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, for the two-year period following the Separation, we are subject to restrictions with respect to:\n\u2022\ntaking any action that would result in our ceasing to be engaged in the active conduct of our business, with the result that we are not engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of certain provisions of the Code;\n\u2022\nredeeming or otherwise repurchasing any of our outstanding stock, other than through certain stock purchases of widely held stock on the open market;\n\u2022\namending our Certificate of Incorporation (or other organizational documents) that would affect the relative voting rights of separate classes of our capital stock or would convert one class of our capital stock into another class of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nliquidating or partially liquidating;\n\u2022\nmerging with any other corporation (other than in a transaction that does not affect the relative shareholding of our shareholders), selling or otherwise disposing of (other than in the ordinary course of business) our assets, or taking any other action or actions if such merger, sale, other disposition or other action or actions in the aggregate would have the effect that one or more persons acquire (or have the right to acquire), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, assets representing one-half or more our asset value;\n\u2022\ntaking any other action or actions that in the aggregate would have the effect that one or more persons acquire (or have the right to acquire), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, capital stock of ours possessing (i) at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or equity interests of ours entitled to vote, or (ii) at least 50% of the total value of shares of all classes of stock or of the total value of all equity interests of ours, other than an acquisition of our shares as part of the Separation solely by reason of holding RRD common stock (but not including such an acquisition if such RRD common stock, before such acquisition, was itself acquired as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares of our stock meeting the voting and value threshold tests listed previously in this bullet); and\n\u2022\ntaking any action that (or failing to take any action the omission of which) would be inconsistent with the Separation qualifying as, or that would preclude the Separation from qualifying as, a transaction that is generally tax-free to RRD and the holders of RRD common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability during such period to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business. These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets. For more information, refer to Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDonnelley Financial\u2019s historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe historical information about Donnelley Financial prior to October 1, 2016 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Donnelley Financial\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with RRD. Donnelley Financial\u2019s historical financial information for such periods was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of RRD. Accordingly, such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows that Donnelley Financial would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that Donnelley Financial will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, Donnelley Financial\u2019s business was operated by RRD as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. RRD or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for Donnelley Financial, such as tax, treasury, finance, audit, risk management, legal, information technology, human resources, stockholder relations, compliance, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and compensation. After the Separation, RRD has continued to provide some of these functions to Donnelley Financial, as described in Transition Services Agreement, filed as Exhibit 2.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Donnelley Financial\u2019s historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from RRD for such functions. These allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses Donnelley Financial would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company in the periods presented. Donnelley Financial will make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which Donnelley Financial no longer has access as a result of the Separation. These initiatives to develop Donnelley Financial\u2019s independent ability to operate without access to RRD\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement. Donnelley Financial may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline.\n\u2022\nPrior to the Separation, Donnelley Financial\u2019s business was integrated with the other businesses of RRD. Donnelley Financial was able to utilize RRD\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although Donnelley Financial has entered into transition agreements with RRD, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits Donnelley Financial enjoyed as a result of being integrated with RRD and may result in Donnelley Financial paying higher charges than in the past for these services. As a separate, independent company, Donnelley Financial may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the Separation, which could decrease Donnelley Financial\u2019s overall profitability. As a separate, independent company, Donnelley Financial may also not be as successful in negotiating favorable tax treatments and credits with governmental entities. This could have a material adverse effect on Donnelley Financial\u2019s consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows for periods after the Separation.\n\u2022\nGenerally, prior to the Separation, Donnelley Financial\u2019s working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, R&D and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of RRD. Currently, following the Separation, the cost of capital for Donnelley Financial\u2019s business may be higher than RRD\u2019s cost of capital prior to the distribution.\nOther significant changes may occur in Donnelley Financial\u2019s cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from RRD. For additional information about the past financial performance of Donnelley Financial\u2019s business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements of Donnelley Financial\u2019s business, refer to the discussion in Note 1, Overview and Basis of Presentation, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred, and we may continue to incur, material costs and expenses as a result of the Separation.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, costs and expenses greater than those we currently incur as a result of the Separation. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting and costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act)). In addition, we expect to either maintain similar or have increased corporate and administrative costs and expenses to those we incurred or were allocated while part of RRD, even though, after the Separation, Donnelley Financial is a smaller, stand-alone company. We cannot assure you that these costs will not be material to our business.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Separation.\nWe believe that the Separation from RRD has allowed, and will continue to allow, among other benefits, us to focus on our distinct strategic priorities; afford us direct access to the capital markets and facilitate our ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock; facilitate incentive compensation arrangements for our employees more directly tied to the performance of our business; and enable us to concentrate our financial resources solely on our own operations. However, we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits. For example, in order to prepare ourselves for the Separation, we undertook a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we currently expect, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses after the Separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of key client relationships. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nRRD or LSC may not satisfy their respective obligations under the Transition Services Agreements and Commercial Agreements that were entered into as part of the Separation, or we may not have necessary systems and services in place when the transition services terms expire.\nIn connection with the separation, we entered into Transition Services Agreements and Commercial Agreements with both RRD and LSC. Refer to Exhibits 2.2 and 2.3, both titled Transition Services Agreement, filed as Exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, related to the agreements with RRD and LSC, respectively. These Transition Services Agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. We will rely on RRD and LSC to satisfy their respective performance and payment obligations under these Transition Services Agreements. If RRD or LSC is unable to satisfy its respective obligations under these Transition Services Agreements, we could incur operational difficulties. The agreements relating to the separation provide for indemnification in certain circumstances and the commercial agreements establish ongoing commercial arrangements. There can be no guarantee that RRD or LSC, as the case may be, will satisfy any obligations owed to us under such agreements, including any indemnification obligations.\nFurther, if we do not have our own systems and services in place, or if we do not have agreements in place with other providers of these services when the term of a particular transition service terminates, we may not be able to operate our business effectively, which could negatively impact our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. We are in the process of creating our own, or engage third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services RRD and LSC will initially provide. We may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from RRD\u2019s or LSC\u2019s systems to our systems, as the case may be, which could disrupt our business and have a negative impact on our consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services RRD and LSC are expected to provide during the transition period.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the Separation and the degree to which we are currently leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe incurred approximately $650 million of debt in connection with the Separation. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Separation, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including facility closure, staff reductions, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and restricting future capital return to stockholders. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the print and related services industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt.\nIn addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nThe agreements and instruments that govern our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement (as defined below) that governs our Credit Facilities (as defined below) and the indenture that governs the Notes (as defined below) contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants can have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Agreement that governs our Credit Facilities requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Term Loan Facility and indenture. If we violate covenants under our Credit Facilities and indenture and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our Credit Facilities and indenture would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt.\nIf our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business and consolidated and combined statements of income, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the Notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur significantly more debt.\nDespite our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although the indenture governing our Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities restrict the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had $153.7 million available for additional borrowing under our Revolving Facility (as defined below). The more indebtedness we incur, the further exposed we become to the risks associated with substantial leverage described above.\nThe highly competitive market for our products and services and industry fragmentation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe financial communications services industry is highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry, and the industry remains highly fragmented in North America and internationally. Management expects that competition will increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging entrants. Additionally, as we expand our product and service offerings, we may face competition from new and existing competitors. As a result, competition may lead to additional pricing pressure on our products and services, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nA failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of clients may adversely impact our business, and if we fail to successfully develop, introduce or integrate new services or enhancements to our products and services platforms, systems or applications, Donnelley Financial\u2019s reputation, net sales and operating income may suffer.\nOur ability to attract new clients and increase sales to existing clients will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and services platforms, including our application solutions, and to introduce new functionality either by acquisition or internal development. Our operating results would suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not brought to market effectively. In addition, it is possible that our assumptions about the features that we believe will drive purchasing decisions for our potential clients or renewal decisions for our existing clients could be incorrect. In the past, we have experienced delays in the planned release dates of new products and services and upgrades to such products and services. There can be no assurance that new products or services, or upgrades to our products or services, will be released on schedule or that, when released, they will not contain defects as a result of poor planning, execution or other factors during the product development lifecycle. If any of these situations were to arise, we could suffer adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of net sales, delay in market acceptance or claims by clients brought against us. Moreover, upgrades and enhancements to our platforms may require substantial investment and there can be no assurance that our investments will help us achieve or sustain a durable competitive advantage in our products and services offerings. If clients do not widely adopt our solutions or new innovations to our solutions, we may not be able to justify the investments we have made. If we are unable to develop, license or acquire new solutions or enhancements to existing services on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new or enhanced solutions do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially negatively impacted.\nUndetected errors or failures found in our products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services that could seriously harm our business.\nOur products and services may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point in their lives, but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released. We frequently release new versions of our products and different aspects of our platform are in various stages of development. Despite testing by us and by current and potential clients, errors may not be found in new products and services until after commencement of commercial availability or use, resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation, client dissatisfaction and reductions in net sales and margins, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in the rules and regulations to which clients or potential clients are subject may impact demand for our products and services.\nMany of our clients are subject to rules and regulations requiring certain printed or electronic communications governing the form, content and delivery methods of such communications. Changes in these regulations may impact clients\u2019 business practices and could reduce demand for our products and services. Changes in such regulations could eliminate the need for certain types of communications altogether or such changes may impact the quantity or format of communications.\nOur failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business.\nMaintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our clients and users who rely on our systems to prepare regulatory filings and store and exchange large volumes of information, much of which is proprietary, confidential and may constitute material nonpublic information for our clients. Inadvertent disclosure of the information maintained on our systems due to human error, breach of our systems through hacking or cybercrime or a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct, could seriously damage our reputation and could cause significant reputational harm for our clients. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. Like all software solutions, our software may be vulnerable to these types of attacks. An attack of this type could disrupt the proper functioning of our software solutions, cause errors in the output of our clients\u2019 work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our clients and other undesirable or destructive outcomes. Furthermore, our systems allow us to share information that may be confidential in nature to our clients across our offices worldwide. This design allows us to increase global reach for our clients and increase our responsiveness to client demands, but also increases the risk of a security breach or a leak of such information because it allows additional points of access to information by increasing the number of employees and facilities working on certain jobs. In addition, our systems leverage third party outsourcing arrangements, which expedites our responsiveness but exposes information to additional access points. If an actual or perceived information leak or breach of our security were to occur, our reputation could suffer, clients could stop using our products and services and we could face lawsuits and potential liability, any of which could cause our financial performance to be negatively impacted. Though we maintain professional liability insurance that includes coverage if a cybersecurity incident were to occur, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available, responsive, or that available coverage will be sufficient to cover losses and claims related to any cybersecurity incidents we may experience.\nA number of core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, client service and financial transactions, rely on our IT, infrastructure and applications. Defects or malfunctions in our IT infrastructure and applications could cause our products and services offerings not to perform as our clients expect, which could harm our reputation and business. In addition, malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types described above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately downtimes, recovery costs and client claims, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nSome of our systems and services are developed by third parties or supported by third party hardware and software and our business and reputation could suffer if these third party systems and services fail to perform properly or are no longer available to us.\nSome of our systems and services are developed by third parties or rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties. These systems and services, or the hardware and software required to run our existing systems and services, may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services, which could negatively affect our business until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. In addition, it is possible that our hardware vendors or the licensors of third party software could increase the prices they charge, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, changing hardware vendors or software licensors could detract from management\u2019s ability to focus on the ongoing operations of our business or could cause delays in the operations of our business.\nAdditionally, third party software underlying our services can contain undetected errors or bugs. We may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until any discovered problems are corrected and, in some cases, may need to implement enhancements or modifications to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services.\nAdverse credit market conditions may limit our ability to obtain future financing.\nWe may, from time to time, depend on access to credit markets. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial markets institutions to fail or may cause lenders to hoard capital and reduce lending. As a result, we may not obtain financing on terms and conditions that are favorable to us, or at all.\nFluctuations in the costs and availability of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials may adversely impact us.\nIncreases in the costs of these inputs may increase our costs and we may not be able to pass these costs on to clients through higher prices. Moreover, rising raw materials\u2019 costs, and any consequent impact on our pricing, could lead to a decrease in demand for our products and services.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other rights, the value of our business and our competitive position may be impaired.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products and services similar to ours, which could decrease demand for our services. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, licensing and other proprietary rights laws, as well as third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures, to protect our intellectual property rights. These protections may not be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying or reverse-engineering our technology and services to create similar offerings. Additionally, any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of protection we seek, if at all. The scope of patent protection, if any, we may obtain from our patent applications is difficult to predict and our patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or of insufficient scope to prevent competitors from offering similar services. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. To protect our proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, independent contractors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and maintain policies and procedures to limit access to our trade secrets and proprietary information. These agreements and the other actions we take may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information or know-how from unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. Further, existing patent laws may not provide adequate or meaningful protection in the event competitors independently develop technology, products or services similar to ours. Even if the laws governing intellectual property rights provide protection, we may have insufficient resources to take the legal actions necessary to protect our interests. In addition, our intellectual property rights and interests may not be afforded the same protection under the laws of foreign countries as they are under the laws of the United States.\nWe have in the past acquired and intend in the future to acquire other businesses, and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the coordination of geographically dispersed organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses and the loss of key personnel from the Company or the acquired businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt the businesses of the Company or the acquired businesses. The Company\u2019s strategy is, in part, predicated on the Company\u2019s ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the Company\u2019s products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nOur business is dependent upon brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition and reputation are important aspects of our business. Maintaining and further enhancing our brands and reputation will be important to retaining and attracting clients for our products. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation for products will continue to increase as competition in the market for our products and industry continues to increase. Our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including the efficacy of our marketing efforts, our ability to retain existing and obtain new clients and strategic partners, human error, the quality and perceived value of our products and services, actions of our competitors and positive or negative publicity. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain talented employees, including management.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain additional skilled personnel could have a serious negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to retain our client base and to attract new clients is directly related to our sales force and client service personnel, and if we cannot retain these key employees, our business could suffer. In addition, many members of our management have significant industry experience that is valuable to our competitors. We expect that our executive officers will have non-solicitation agreements contractually prohibiting them from soliciting our clients and employees within a specified period of time after they leave Donnelley Financial. If one or more members of our senior management team leave and cannot be replaced with a suitable candidate quickly, we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees and retirees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to both employees and retirees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. and internationally may also increase our cost of providing such benefits.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, or lower returns on assets may increase required pension and other post-retirement benefits plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with historically low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions may increase the level of expected required pension and other post-retirement benefits plan contributions in future years. Various conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate, or worsen, the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension and other post-retirement benefits plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nWe are exposed to risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non-U.S. activities, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into our financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, net sales and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, we may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses.\nThere are risks associated with operations outside the United States.\nWe have operations outside the United States. We work with capital markets clients around the world, and in 2016 our International segment accounted for 14% of our combined net sales. Our operations outside of the United States are primarily focused in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of customizing products and services for foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\nincreased infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting and information technology;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npotentially greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, including currency conversion and cash repatriation from foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nincreased licenses, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nincreased burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including employment-related laws, which may be more stringent than U.S. laws;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable anti-corruption and sanction laws and regulations.\nWe cannot be sure that our investments or operations in other countries will produce desired levels of net sales or that one or more of the factors listed above will not affect our global business.", "PERMNO": 16277, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "DFIN"}
